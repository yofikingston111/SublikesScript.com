Kids, do you need to pee? Yes daddy! Five minutes will be enough, Bertille? Yes, yes! Oh, fuck! What's going on? Sylvie lost the baby. Oh shit... How long had she been pregnant? Almost three months. That's terrible... If you're not playing give it to me! Who lost the baby? Stop the car as soon as you can, I need to call her. Mom... Who lost the baby? It's Sylvie, a family friend. You've seen her once when you were 3 or 4. And... How did she lose it? Hm... The pregnancy didn't go well. She had a miscarriage. You know Tom, before I had you I had a miscarriage too, like Sylvie. Sadly, it happens, that's how it is. Can you imagine? You could have had a big brother, or a big sister. Stop there! Oh, yeah, I need to fill the tank anyway. So kids, use this time to go pee. Yes! I did it! Damn it feels good to have arrived! Shit! What? Look, there's water everywhere. Wait a minute kids, don't walk in here. Yeah, and don't put the luggage down. It's everywhere. It's a complete flood. And huh the fridge is down. Let's take a picture for the insurance company. Are we going to the beach? No Bertille, we're not going, can't you see there's water everywhere? Honey do you think Serge is here? Not on the week-ends. Anyway, I hope there's nothing in the bedrooms. Oh no, not the bedrooms! We're boarding! Looping! I hope there'll be some crabs! But there's no crab in the pond. In this case, if I find some, they'll be all mine! Why did you bring your cars? I'm gonna make a loop in the sand. You're going to ruin them. No! Wanna bet? Next stop... The pond! Arrival in three minutes! Bertille! Bertille! Yes! It's almost noon, we're gonna go home. Okay! Did you get all your stuff? Huh... I don't know. Oh no... I've lost a car. What did I tell you Bertille? But I've played with it earlier... Look it's lost now, we're not gonna find it. Come get dressed! Alright. Rho... My shoes are full of sand. It was my favorite, on top of it... Do you think that someone will find it? I don't have a clue, Bertille. Wait! Sorry! Sorry! Where did you find your car? Because I think it's ours, we lost it at the pond. Who do you think you are? You think I'm a thief? No no no, not at all, it's just that... It's just that what? Do you have a problem, fucker? It's MY car! Fuck you, it's mine! Not at all, look, it's missing a headlight, it's ours. Are you crazy or what? You want me to punch you? No no it's alright it's alright! Don't touch me, you want me to kill you? No, no, stop! Little whore! It's alright! You play tough so now grow some balls! Let go of my brother! Come on, get out of here! What a jerk... Who does it belong to? I don't know. It was on the floor. Maybe it's his, it must have fallen out of his pocket. There's 60 euros. You know what Bertille. We're not gonna tell anything to mom and with these 60 euros we can buy as many cars as we want, ok? Hmm... But if it's his, he's gonna come back. Don't worry. That's 30 euros for me and 30 euros for you. Yeah, yeah. We have to hide it, I know a great hiding place! I'll take care of it Bertille. Ah, was it good at the pond? Yeah. Come on Bertille, set the table please. No! Oh come on, it's your turn, don't argue! It's always my turn! It's Tom's turn! Bertille, listen to mom! Bertille! Tom? Are you here? Yeah. Where did you hide the money? I'm not telling you now otherwise you'll repeat it. I'm sure you put it in the comic book! No. I'll go to Darty. You'll take the kids to the market? Yeah, yeah. Bertille, stop the piano and come to the table! Oh no! Why do we eat croque-monsieurs again, seriously? We don't have the choice, we eat the left overs. If you eat well, you might get a dessert. Oh! A Danette? Yeah, for example! Ok, I'll eat. Out of the office from the 1st to the 31st of July. It's crazy, no one's available! Well, good start for the holidays... Come on kids, let's clear the table and go to bed. Psst, Tom. Who is it? I don't know. Ok, I'll go see mom. Be more quiet. Go away. Mom? Dad? Who's the boy? Mom, who's the boy? Shh! Sylvie is sleeping in the next room. Sylvie? The one that has aborted? Yes! Shh! They arrived yesterday night, so I let Philippe sleep in your room. Yeah... be nice to him. Because they're going through a lot. I can count on you, right kids? - Tom? Where did you hide the money? - Oh, will you stop Bertille? As usual, you'll keep it all to yourself and I won't get anything. Anyway, I will look everywhere and I'll keep everything to myself! Tom! What should we do? Should we play a game? I'm gonna see mom. Too bad... How are you? Did you sleep well? Yes, fine, I manage to rest. Because you've arrived late yesterday... Yeah, really late I swear, it was hell to get out of Paris. Oh yeah I know... Morning Felix! Morning. Tom? Did you sleep well? Yeah. Wow! It's crazy how much you've grown! You know what? I wouldn't have recognised you! How old are you now? 15 years old 15? Oh yeah? Actually, you're only 2 years apart with Felix. But I was sure it was more. No, no. We just celebrate it in June. Ah... Hey, Felix! Your phone. Sorry, I have to answer to something. What did we say? Two seconds! Now we're having breakfast! But I'm not hungry, thanks! Here we go again... Texts... texts... friends. Eh! Where do you think you're going? You know what we're gonna do? You can just go all together to the pond with Bertille this afternoon. Sorry, I'll be right back. He better not do this during the whole the stay. Tom... don't be foolish with him. Besides, Bertille's with you, so take it easy, okay? So cool! No one's here! Hey, Tom! Can I use the pedal boat? It's not ours Bertille Oh pff... What are you drawing? People and landscapes. Show me? Hm, you draw well. -Thanks. It's because I'm entering a Bachelor of Applied Arts. Oh... I'm gonna kill her. Who? My mom! She's sending me 50 messages a day and then she says I'm always on my phone. My mom also had a... She had a miscarriage. Oh yeah? Yeah, just before I was born. Do you have any brother or sister? No, but I should have. It's the second time she has a miscarriage. Is is nice to have a sister? It depends. And you spend every summer... (his phone is ringing) Yeah, hello? What do yo want? Yeah, fine we'll be there! Bertille! Yeah? We're leaving. Ok! So I've added some mustard, some nuoc mam, huh... Yeah yeah, totally. We had agreed no Nintendo DS during meals. Here, confiscated. That's unfair... Give her some salad please. Ok, give me your plate Bertille I don't like salad, stop it! Come on, you have to eat some. And do you have any friends around here? No, not really. There are some neighbours but they'll arrive in August Hmm. But there are some cool things to do around, right? Yes there is Rayol! What is aureole? Raaayol. It's the large beach with lots of crabs and waves as big as THIS. It's super nice! I've been there many times Oh yes, you should go by bike! I've fixed them all Only mine is still not working. That's a really good idea. This way, we can go to Bertrand's have a little beer tasting. What about me, can I come with you? On top of it your son is a drinker! Congrats! But I can come along, no? Yeah, yeah, if you want Felix. What is the rest of you doing? We're going to the beach! The weather is not nice enough to go to the beach, tomorrow would be better no? So, kids, what are you doing then? Are you coming with us? We're leaving at 2pm. I'm coming with you, that's for sure. Come ooon, smile, it's not so bad. We'll go to the beach tomorrow, alright? Where's Tom? He's outside i think. If you want there's some coke I don't like coke I want to go to Rayol! Well Bertille, let it go or we're going home. Tom! Tom! Do you have your head in the clouds? Hm no. Look what I got! I found it in the basement, it's open. But if you want, you can go get another. Well maybe one bottle is already enough? I don't know, it's half empty... Well nevermind. Wait what are you doing? I don't know, aren't we going there? What about Bertille? Have you ever been drunk? No. I have. With some tequila. And the bottle is worth 25 euros dude. We totally need to get another one. It's sour. Hey, yo, what are you up to? Well we're drinking. Can we join you? Yeah, yeah, if you want to. I am Iris and over there she's Pauline. Hi! Hi. So... Why are you two hiding like this? Our parents are right there and the bottle is stolen so... Wouldn't you rather go sit on the pontoon? It's nicer. Yeah because right now you look a bit like tramps, you know? We were really good before you came. Chill out, it's a joke. We're going, are you coming? By the way, do you smoke a bit? Come on Tom! And, huh, shouldn't we go buy more bottles? No don't worry, we're good. Are you from here? Hm no, we're at the camping there with some friends. By the way what's your name? I am Félix. What about you, what's your name? Tom! Okay! Come on let's settle near the boat. By the way, how long are you staying here? Hmm well 10 days, I mean, until the ball. What, there's a ball? Yeah! Do you have cardboard for rolling Iris? Yeah here you go. Thanks. But don't put too much weed, we need to keep some for tonight. Sit down, no? If you wan there's some room here! You okay? I... I might go, Bertille is alone. I might go see her. You can stay a bit... Chill, you can go back later. Do as you want Tom. No but I'm gonna go. Okay no worries, we'll see you at some other time. Yeah that was cool. Bye! Bye! Man, you have to drink some Fine Flore, it's really good! It's a local beer, right? Yeah! Ah, yeah. It's nice. I think I've drunk seven beers, no? Oh come on, relax, we're on holidays. Oh wait, Felix has texted me Yes I know, he is with Tom. They are on their way home Do they have the keys? They are on the rock! Bertille! We're leaving! Yes yes wait for me, I'm coming! Tom! Wait for me, I'm coming with you. Didn't you want to stay with them? No, no, I'm good. Here, help me finish it, we can't go home with this. It's strong. I think it's okay. Here you go. You're holding on? It's not funny, the world is spinning. You didn't throw up everything earlier. Come on, throw up! No, no, I don't want to! Are you sure? Yeah. You alright? I'm better. I'm taking you to the shower, we're gonna clean up. Come on help me. Okay, take this off for starters. We need to hurry. The parents are gonna be here soon. Follow me. Open your mouth. Wider! It's not too hot? No it's okay. We're gonna shampoo you good, like at the hairdresser's. Does it feel good? Yeah... Okay let's wash it off. Perfect. Your turn now. Like this? Why are you looking at me? You know, I notice when you look at me. Have you ever kissed a boy? Have you ever kissed a boy? Hmm, no. Do you want to know what it feels like? Close your eyes. So? Okay, let's hurry, the parents are on their way. Stop it. Tomorrow, we're going to Rayol? Daddy, hey oh! Tomorrow we're going to the beach, right? Yes, we'll see. This beer is so good. We were right to get two boxes of it. Tom, eat, you haven't tried anything. Eh, Félix! Félix, are you asleep? No! I need to show you something. We found this on the ground with Bertille yesterday, it's 60€. No way? Nice! What are you gonna do with it? Here, I give you 20. This way we split in 3. -You sure? Yes, it's better this way, we all have the same amount. No but it's not my money. No, no, no, it's better like this. Good night! Bertille. For the 60 euros, I thought that since Felix is with us. We could split in three, so that we are together. No, no, no! Bertille! I found them so I decide what we do with it. It was near my bucket, it's not fair. It's always the same anyway. What is going on? Quit it, Bertille. I am the youngest and I am always getting scammed, never you. There is a bunch of stuff I wanted to buy. What's going on Bertille, is it because of the 60 euros? I can give them back to you if you want, it's not a big deal. You want it? Take it. No. Tell me what can I do to make Bertille happy. You see, if each of us have 20 euros we are together I'm not talking to you anymore! Okay, let's try something else. We can put the 60 euros in a common jar like some kind of treasure, you see? So that we can buy stuff together. We don't have 20 euros each but 60 euros for all of us. Okay? It means I can buy something that costs 60 euros? Well.... I don't know I know! A Nintendo 3DS! It doesn't cost 60 euros. It does, I saw it once. Come on, let's go. Kids, did you lay the table? Yes we did lay the table. Don't be disrespectful. Yes, dad. Here, Félix. That's for me? Yes. That is one good looking bus. It's not a bus, it's a limousine. Well, that is one good looking limousine, then. You know what? I'm actually really good at drawing cars. You know how to draw cars? Sport cars? Sure, give me a sheet I'll show you. You can draw so well! Can I have it? Can I have it? Can I have it? Can I have it? Wait, let me sign it. Here you go! Mom, mom! Look at what Félix draw me! You can draw? Not at all, just convertibles. Otherwise I suck at this. What are you drawing? Show me. Is this me? Well... yeah. Why didn't you draw my face? You had your head down. Will you draw something for me? Well... yeah. What do you want? Would you draw a picture of me? I can try. O kay, nice. That sucks, there is no crabs. Stop whining, Bertille. We can't find them everytime. We could make a sand castle. Yeah! A giant sand castle. You want to make one Bertille? Yes. Tom, can you give us a hand? I you want but uh... We should go somewhere else, the sand is too wet here. I can add some decoration with the rake. Whatever you want to do, Bertille. The sand is not too wet here? No I think it's good, it's comapct. You are ruining my decorations. You will make them at the end. So what do I do? I widen the moats. We have to strengthen the walls so that it doesn't crumble. I know! I will fetch some water for the moats. Good idea, Bertille. You are lucky to have a house by the sea. Where do you spent your, usually? My step father was an expat. We moved around all the time in airbnbs, stuff like that. He lives in India but we will move to Poland next year. Have you ever been to India? Yes, several times. You're lucky. Where are you? Wait, I'm almost there I think I feel you. You do, I can feel your fingers. It's weird. Yes, it's fun. Quick! The sea is rising, we must protect the castle! Oh, you're right! I'm going to make a wall. Move over Bertille. Give us a hand, Bertille! No, I'm finishing the castle. No we have to protect it first! What can I help you with? With your hands. Old school. Why do you have the shovel? Because I am the older one. No, it is Félix actually. The castle is going to die! Kids, let's go home! It's not working. What are you drawing? I'm trying to draw your portrait but I can't, it's not really convincing. I can pose for you, I might be easier. Fuck, it's not working. Mom, your charger is not working! Nervermind. You're going like this? Yes. I don't know. We are going to the bal. I'm sure you have better clothes that this old tee. Don't you have a shirt? I don't think so. Wait I'll find something for you. T his one is nice. Won't I look like a tourist? Tourist my ass, arrogant Parisian boy. Come on, get up. You roll up the sleeves, just like that. This one too. You watch your hair too. See? You're handsome. You're going to seduce all the ladies. Dinner's ready! We're coming I'm going downstairs. What is the first thing you look in a girl? Uh... Her eyes, I guess. Her eyes? Well, yeah. But that sucks. Why? Hello? Yeah, we're going to the bal with Tom. Oh come on, 12:30! 12:30! Come on, I'm 17. Fine, midnight. Yes, bye. It's here. Where are you going? It's this way. I'm not going to this dumb bal. Come on, Pauline is throwing a party. But we said to the parents we were going to the bal. As you want, I'm going to Pauline's w-wait! Hi guys! - How are you doing? - Hey Félix. Iris, look who's here. Hey, how are you doing? How was the party without me? Aren't you drunk? Tom! How are you? We're behind you. Anouk! No, no, no. Come on, I'm helping you with her. Give it back. You don't know her, we don't care I've been talking to her for a week. As I said, you don't know her. She just want to suck your dick. Give it back! Hey, what's going on? Anouk is fucking things up on Tinder. Dude, look at all the girls here! Get off Tinder for a minute, you're annoying. You want your phone? Yes. Well no. Anouk! You really think we can meet people online? Sure, why? I don't know, isn't it sad? No I don't think so. That is how it happened with my ex. And it doesn't prevent you from meeting people in real life. What was her name? I wanted to ask you something. Are you siblings? Why? You think we look alike? I don't know, there is a little something. Come on, be nice to your big brother. Hey, cousin! - How are you doing? - Good and you? Guys, this is Handsome Leo. Well, we know each other. Have you met already? Yeah, we've met at the lake. Oh, shit Leo! Do you hear? What did he do? Nothing. - Are you sure? - Yes, don't worry. Come on, let's go dance. No, I don't really like to dance. Come on. Watch me. Follow my lead. Come on, relax! Watch your arms. Relax! Félix, it's almost midnight. We should head back home. Okay, wait. I have to pee. Follow me. Iris's friends are nice, aren't they. Don't you want to stay a little longer? Shouldn't you go pee too? Our parents must be so drunk right now. I'm sure they will be home late. We can go dance one more time. No, I'm going to go. If they come back. What time is it? Five to midnight. Okay, go home. I won't be long either. Tom. Are you sleeping? No. Told you they aren't home yet. You did not stay? No. It was a mess. Cops came over. Why didn't you stay? I was tired. What did you do? Nothing. Do you have a girlfriend? No. I never had one. And a boyfriend? No. What about you? Speak louder I can't hear you. Bertille is asleep. Crawl into the bed, I can't hear you. Is there enough room? Sure, don't worry. What were you saying? What about you? Do you have somebody? I thought. But actually she doesn't care about me. What do you mean? She told me she wanted something casual and limited. It's not fun is it? Yeah, that's weird. At least she's honest. I want to smoke. Don't you want to go outside? But it's raining. We can go in the tree house. Pass me the lantern. Is tha t a cigarette? No it's weed. Iris gave me some. You want to try? Don't worry it's really not strong. Here. It's a really nice place here. I was wondering. How come you never had a relationship? I'm sure there's plenty of people that secretely like you. I always was the youngest in school. They're all a year older than me. There is this guy in my class, he was 18 and he had a beard. - Really? - Yes. What about you? Do you have one? No, nothing. It is not bad actually. You won't have any pimple. And uh... You got some hair down there? Well... Yes, a little bit. Come on, show me. I don't mind, I can show you. Come on, your turn. Oh yeah. You have some. I feel so light. Do you like it? Yeah. It's weird. It's spinning a bit though. Do you hear? Crickets. It's nice here isn't it. I think the parents are home. I don't want to leave. Come on, we will have a good sleep I bet. Not bad. Two. You're so good, you did at least five. How are you doing? I can't. Wait, let me try. Don't worry, you just have to train. Look. See? I did like three. It's hard. Let me take another one. My turn. No, look. Like this. What is this thing? It's a ball. A wooden ball. Attached to a rope. And a piece of wood. What is it for? I'll ask them. I can't do it. Don't scratch, show me. No, it's bad. Look what I found. It's a cup and ball game. Look Tom I found a bup and call game. What is this game? I don't know it. Show me your drawings. Mind your own stuff, Bertille. How does this thing work? They're great I'll show you Bertille. I'm not quit satisfied. - Why? I think I can do better. Come on, let's go home. I take my bucket. Here Bertille. Give me my towel. Don't forget anything this time. - No, I i don't forget anything. Everybody make mistakes. I can't do it. This game sucks. - Let me show you. The rope has to be still. And so has the ball. And then you throw! So cool! - Okay your turn. You have to be focused I have been focused for at least 1000 years. Félix? How are you doing? - Good and you? Yeah, bit hangovered but I'm okay. To bad you didn't stay last night, it was such a mess. Really? - Yeah. I'm going out with some friends, you want to join us? I have to eat with my parents actually I call you at 2:00? - Yeah, sure. Great. See you. - See you. Look Tom! I almost did it! - Good job, Bertille. Félix, could you show me again? - A t home okay? Hold my hand. You're alone? Where are they? Bertille went to her surf class. And Félix went to see some friends. Why isn't it burning? It burns easily usually. Fuck. Fuck it. Are you okay? No. Don't you feel sometimes that you are totally alone? I can go get you an ice cream if you want. That would be nice, yes. Here. Get in the bed. Here. I could be with a bunch of people I'm always alone. Even when you are with us? No, with you it's great. I always wanted to have a little brother or sister. I can give you Bertille, you'll see. After a week you won't stand her anymore. - Don't say that. You want some? Thanks. Here. - No it's okay you can have it. Give me your hand. Is there somebody? - My father is cooking outside. Do you think he heard us? - I don't think so. Tom! Outch! Can you go fetch a bag of charcoal, please? Yes, i'm coming! Fuck I hurt my head. Do you have enough money? Tom! - Y es, I'm coming! Fuck, that hurts. How far is the supermarket? - It's close. We're almost there. Just after the slope. Wait, get off. Follow me. Where are we going? Have you lost something, boy? - No, no, no. What are you doing in my field? - Hurry! Wait, the bike! You pricks! Do you think she's still here? - Why are so stopping? Go! Here, let me try something else. One, two... Try it. Try again. Almost there. Here let's try again. One, two... Don't you want to sit with us, kids? - No, we're good. There is this girl in my class, she got pregnant - For real? Yeah. She had an abortion, she was 16. All the school knew about it. - For real? Bertille, do you know what abortion means? Of course I know what it means. What does it mean then? Well it means that the mission has been aborted. You are not telling what it means here. - Yes I am. Mom, mom! We can say "Miss ion has been aborted", right? Yes, we can. See? And how do I know this? Thanks to Pokémon blue I'm not staying with you, you guys are not intelligent enough. I hate when she does this. Tomorrow is my last day. Really? You're going to India after that? No, I'll go to Bordeaux to see my father. But uh. Next year I might move to Poland. My step father thinks that the distance caused the miscarriage. I so don't want to go. Maybe you could stay in Paris with us I should ask my parents. That would be nice. Don't you want to go inside? Mosquitos are eating me alive. Sure. Are you doing a jigsee puzzle? - A what? A jigsee puzzle. - It's called a jigsaw puzzle. We can you something else if you want. Do you know how to play tawot? I'm messing with you. We can meet Iris at the lake. If you want. Seems tricky. It's a 1000 pieces. It's been here for ever. We never finished it. It's boring. I like it. What are you doing? - Sorting the edges. These two go together I think. I'm not sure. I can't find edges. - Here, I made a pile. If you find pieces with boat part on it, give them to me. Okay. You are doing a jigsaw puzzle? Which one? The Big Wave by Hokusai. This is a nice one. We're going to sleep. Good night - Good night. Can I play with them? No Bertille, you played the whole evening with your DS. Let's go to sleep. Yes. You never look at the picture? - No, it's too easy. We won't complete it before going to bed. What time is it? Almost 2:00 - Really? Don't you want to go to sleep? It's my last day tomorrow. Sure. I'm so ugly. C an you tickle my back? Yes. What are you doing? - Bertille, go to sleep! Are you kissing? Bertille, be quiet. The parents are next door. Why is he laughing? Bertille. Go to sleep. Why do I have to sleep and you don't? You know what Bertille? We are all tired. So we are all going to sleep, okay? Okay. Good night. - Good night. Look, look! I did it! We didn't see, it doesn't count. - Yes it does count. He's joking Bertille. We believe you, don't worry. Okay. We can proceed by elimination. No.That would be cheating. Can you do it Tom? - Do what? The cup and ball game. I don't want to right now. Why? God, I can't find the right one. Félix, do you think we can play the cup and ball game with the feet? Uh, I don't know I never tried. Although I think it might be hard. I think it's not possible, unless you are a monkey. What do we do today? As you want. We can go to the beach. Reyol or Gauret. Reyol! Please, Félix, reyol! There. This one was a pain in the ass. Well done. Lunch is ready! - Coming! Bertille, can you put your plate in the sink? Okay, let's dive back in. This one not here... Can I see the picture? - No Bertille. Why? - Because that's cheating. We're going to a friend's, are you going to the beach? Yes. - Okay, we leave the keys under the rock. Okay. Where is this one going... I'm sure they're going to their wine brewer friend. We brew beer, Bertille. - Well, no. Anyways Bertille, do you have a boyfriend? Yes. I have four. No, five. You have several? - Yes. One at the judo class, two at school. One at my swimming class. And that's it. That makes only four. Wait, I have two at my swimming class! No, two in my judo class, that's it. Which one is your favorite? I mean, the one you want to marry and have kids with. By the way, where are the 60 euros? We spent them Bertille. We bought ice creams. Coke, candies... It did not cost 60 euros. - Yes it did Bertille. As usual you spent it all and I had nothing. First, it was for the three of us. Then, you spent it all. Quit it, Bertille. No, see, I won't because I said quit it! Okay, okay, I stop. You're still doing that jigsaw? It's your last day Félix, it's sunny. Yes, we're almost done. Wait. There is a piece missing. I have it! I wanted to complete it, so I took it. There I'm going to tell mom. Mom, mom! We completed the puzzle! I'm going to take a shower and call Iris. She told me she was doing something tonight. Tomorrow we leave at 9:00 Félix, so be back for midnight. Okay! Do you have the bottle? - Yes, it's in my backpack. Good? Yes. - Let's go. These bikes suck. How is your saddle? It's okay. Mine is to big. Come on, one hand, one hand! Come on Tom, try it I'm scared. Come on, focus. The other hand now. Watch out. Don't worry. Shut the fuck up! Are you okay? - Yeah, don't worry, I'm fine. I'm fine, I can walk. Wait. Help me walk. Let's go? - Are you sure? Yeah, don't worry I'll hold my bike. You're dumb. It's not me it's the bike. - I told you. It's was a nice crash at least, wasn't it? Are you kidding? Don't go too fast. - Okay let's go. Hi guys! Look what Tom brought us. No way. Yes, that's great! Very nice. Pour me a drink. Don't you want to sit, Tom? Yes, yes. Watch it, okay? - Yeah, yeah. Hey dude, how are you doing? I'm good. Sorry for last time. I was a jerk. Sorry. - It's fine. Are you from here? Yes. My house is a 20 minute ride from here. - Nice. Do you have a light? - No. Dude, you have a light? - Yeah, here. There is this chick flooding you right now. Which one? - The purple one. Don't be a jerk I like her. - Yeah, she's hot. What about Sophie? Give it back. Don't be a pain in the ass. - come on, killjoy. Look guys, Valentin is high! You're quit drunk aren't you? - I am so not drunk. Don't you want to make the virgin smoke? - Oh yeah. You smoke? What is it? - Test, you'll see. Don't be scared. Take this. Put your finger here. And take a deep breath. Ready? Dope, right? Don't make him smoke that, look how young he is - It's fine. Dude are you all right? I'm out of cigarettes. Do you know where I can get some? There is a shop on the other side. You dare? - You give me one? Sure. Guys, Leo and Bapt are going to swim across the river to buy cigarettes, they're so dumb. Oh shit! Wait for me I'm coming. Félix, are you coming? - I can't I hurt myself with the bike. Ow, poor you. Tom, are you coming? Hurry, cousin! - Coming! Tom! Are you coming? Sure. - Nice! Tom you don't have to do that. - It's fine, it's not far. Are you sure? - Yeah. And all the way back too? - Yes, give me a break. Come on, Tom! Don't think, dive! Really you don't have to. Leave me alone, you're not my big brother! How are we going to bring the cigarettes back? Tom, don't go! Come back! Tom what are you doing? I'm scared of water. - Shut the fuck up, Leo! It's not funny. Are you leaving? Tom you suck. Prepare the towels, you faggot. Oh fuck it's so damn cold! I'm sorry, I don't like you doing this. I have no business being here anyway. - Don't say that. Come on. - I should have left you alone. Cover up. Let's go home, you'll catch cold. Good night. - Good night. I thought you were grounded. - Yes, but I help clear up the table. Can you put the DS on the nightstand please? - Sure. My pillow. Good night. Good night. - Good night. Félix? I'm not sleepy. Me neither. Move over. I don't want you to leave. Me neither. Can I hold your bag? - It's too heavy. Hold my hand. How long are you staying for? - Until late august. Don't you have Facebook? - I'll see if I can create an account. Yeah, that'd be great. Bye Bertille. Bye. Be nice, okay? - I'm always nice. Wait. What is it? - You'll open it in the train. Is it my portrait? - you'll see. Come on Félix, let's go. Well, then... See you. Oh shoot! - What is it? Three kids have drowned last night, near the pier. Were they from here? Yes. There was a girl.
