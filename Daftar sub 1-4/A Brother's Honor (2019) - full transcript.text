- Foreman, has the jury reached a verdict? - We have, your honor. Will you hand the verdict form to the court, please. On the charge of first degree murder in the death of Sylvia Granger, we the jury find Sheppard Granger... guilty. ♪♪ We the jury find Sheppard Granger... guilty. ♪♪ Call Caden Granger. ♪♪ ♪♪ Caden! You deliberately egged that woman on. She was practically stripping for you. Is that why you were off key? Surely you can understand why. Hey, Jace. What's up? I'm on my way. The only thing I understand... is what I thought you understood. We were lovers, Rena. For a while. Nothing more. Were... lovers. What's up, Jace? And I should care why? He wouldn't care whether I was there one way or the other. All right. Uh... You should go. If you think what he did to you all those years ago... Denying you access to your trust fund was wrong... Then you should go. Let him see that in spite of what he did, you've become a huge success. Oh... Well... it doesn't matter. I think it does. It's Jace, Granddad. I'm here. Dalton? Paging Dr. Ross. Please report to emergency immediately. It's nice seeing you again, Sedrick. I'm sorry to hear about your dad's passing. Thank you. How's Shiloh? She's fine. Back here in Virginia to help our mom. He's resting comfortably now. You handled that well. Doesn't matter one way or the other. Yet, you asked. Curiosity, Jace. Nothin' more. This was your plan to get us all back in one spot? It worked. Now, why am I not surprised to find you two goofing off? - Dalton. - Hell, yeah, it's me. Holy shit. Dalton. Dalton! I don't recall him ever being that sick. The man was as strong as an ox. He had a heart attack, Dalton. A massive one. You spoke to Dad? I spoke to the warden. How is he? You wouldn't have to ask that if you actually took the time to see him. - And I was talking to Jace. - And I was talking to you. When's the last time you saw Dad? Five years? Look, I'm not like you. Okay? I can't stand seeing the man locked up like that, talking to him through a damn glass partition. Sheppard Granger was a respectable business man. A law-abiding citizen. He never had so much as a goddamn speeding ticket. So this has nothing to do with you thinking Dad was guilty? What? No. Why... Why would you think that? Because we, of all people, have reason to believe Dad had the motive. Especially after the arguments that we heard. Your grandfather's awake. He's asking for you. Jace. Caden. Dalton. Listen. I always wanted you to be a better man. You were Sylvia's baby. You grew up entitled. I know you're angry... but I'm so proud of you... for finding success on your own. That's what I always wanted for you. I keep tabs on you boys. Don't talk. - Save your energy. - No. Please, listen. Granger Aeronautics is your legacy. I need you to claim it. I know you have lives of your own. But something is going on. You three are the only ones I trust. Promise me you will work together to save our company. Of course I will. I... I promise. I promise I'll do what I can. One more thing. Free your father. Prove he's innocent. Promise me. Thank you. Remember everything I taught you, and... and always watch each other's backs. ♪♪ Well, well, well, who'd have thought young Shiloh Timmons would have filled out like that, huh? That was your best friend. You ain't even gonna say hello? Yeah, that was ages ago. Everybody defected when Dad went to prison, Caden, not just her. Let's go home. ♪♪ Mm-mm-mm. Hannah still makes the best coffee. Yeah. See what you've been missing all those years you refused to come home? Yeah. I see. Yeah. Yes. If my ride is the same, I'll be there. I have a couple concerts in New York next week. I didn't forget the promise, but I committed. You're not the only one. Can't believe we made that promise. Shit. I haven't worked that hard in years. Being a boy toy has its perks, evidently. Were you not at the hospital, because Granddad said he was proud of me, so... Clearly, he knew something we don't. Mm-hm. Care to share? I'm a billionaire. You boys have a visitor. Vidal Duncan is here. That's the company attorney. This conversation isn't finished. ♪♪ Any of y'all been over there since the day we left? I haven't. Haven't wanted to. Neither have I. So, as you can see from the way your grandfather has set things up, Freeman is to step down the moment you arrive at the office tomorrow. Tomorrow? What's the hurry? Granger Aeronautics has been in the red for the past year. The company's going under? Unless you guys do something about it. Excuse me. And how are we supposed to do that? Uh, I say we vote to get rid of the company. No, damn it, we gave our word and we're gonna keep it. By doing what? What did working there for a couple summers teach us? Not jack shit. What, you're afraid of a little hard work? Uh, I prefer to work smarter and not harder. Well, I, for one, will do whatever it takes to save something that I care about. Mm. And how did that pan out for your marriage? What does this have to do with my marriage? Okay, guys. You've both said enough. Jace is right, Dalton. We all made a promise. So are you in or not? I'm in. Good. Never liked your wife anyway. She never liked you. We have a problem. Freeman doesn't want to step down. He's called a shareholders meeting to ask them to vote to keep him in charge, citing your lack of experience. Well, can he do that? Don't we have majority share? Your grandfather sold some shares last year to finance a bid for another company. The remaining shareholders together, their shares rival yours. I need the names and the numbers of the stockholders now. On it. What's the game plan? For cryin' out loud, Caden. Even a boy toy like me can figure that out. He's gonna buy back the shares that Granddad sold off. - Right, Jace? - Not quite. I won't be buying back shares. Then who will? For cryin' out loud, Dalton. Even a simple saxophone player like myself can figure that one out. You are Mr. Billionaire. Might I offer a suggestion? Her company has helped to get several firms out of the red very quickly. She might put some minds at ease. Shana Bradford. Thanks, Vidal. If we survive tomorrow, I'll call. You, uh, couldn't sleep either, huh? Well, I was just thinking over what to have for Sunday dinner with the three of you home again. I want it to be special. You do too much for us. It's my job. He loved you. You know? You knew? Yeah, he told me and I was glad. Do Caden and Dalton? No, I don't know. Doesn't matter. You're family. Thank you for that. Thank you. You know, you boys are doing the right thing for your granddaddy. He... He loved that company. He would not have asked you three to take it over if he didn't believe that you could do it. I hope you're right, Hannah. I don't want to let him down. You won't. Running Granger's in your blood. And then you can settle down, remarry, and give me another generation of Grangers to raise. One thing at a time, Hannah. One thing at a time. We're the Grangers. We're here for the stockholders meeting. Yes, Mr. Granger. The meeting is about to start. Jace, Caden, Dalton. Very happy you could join us. And I'm very sorry about your loss. This has been a very difficult time for all of us. But now... Now is not the time for a change in leadership. I... I respect Richard wanting a Granger to run the company, I really do, but... I have been the vice president now for two years. I am the most capable person to take this company where it needs to go to survive. Let the Granger sons work under me for a while. Learn the ins and outs of the company. And then, when the time is right, I will happily step down and let them run it. But now... Now is not that time. This company was started by my great grandfather over 70 years ago. It was run by my grandfather... my father... and in the absence of my father, my grandfather again. My grandfather loved this company. And on his deathbed, Richard Granger asked my brothers and I to take over the running of Granger Aeronautics. He knew it was in the best interest of this company. And he had faith in us. I'm hoping that you do, too. I'm asking for your vote of confidence. Titus Freeman? Freeman. Vidal Duncan? Granger. Cal Arrington? Freeman. Lauren Bolson? Freeman. Caden Granger? Granger. Dalton Granger? Granger. Jace Granger. Granger. And I have one proxy vote for Freeman. We are at a tie. Deciding vote goes to Shiloh Timmons, proxy for Sandra Timmons. Granger. Your girl saved the day, bro. She's not my girl. Okay. Well, her dad was an asshole who kept her away from us, but he is gone now, and she sure doesn't look like a kid anymore. - Drop it. - Okay. Freeman and I have reached an understanding. Understanding my ass. I don't trust that dude. Neither do I. I'll keep an eye on him. I'll take Granddad's office. Dad's office will remain the same way. Granddad has kept it all these years. I want to see Dad. I suggest we all go see him. I'm gonna set up a meeting with Shana Bradford. According to Vidal, if anyone can get us out of the red, she can. - Dad. - Yeah? Is something bothering you? No. But there is something I need to talk to you about. Okay. What is it? I'm thinking about remarrying. Um... I wasn't aware that you were seeing anyone. Does Jules know? No. No, I... I'm... I'm... I'm not seeing anyone. Technically. Mona and I, we... run into each other every so often at the farmer's market. We chat... over vegetables. But we have not been out on an official date. And you're thinking about marriage? She is... the first woman that I've met that I've had these kind of thoughts about since your mom passed. Well, those are some vegetables. What do you know about her? She's, uh... kind. Generous. She's a professor... of political science at the University of Virginia. Retiring in a few years. Divorced, I... I do know that. How long ago? Why do I feel like I'm being interrogated? Because you're an ex-cop and it comes with the territory. I've gotta go. A potential client insisted on an urgent lunch meeting today. But I will be back for leftovers and... To delve into this Mona situation. Have I told you lately how proud I am of you? Not lately. Thanks, Dad. Greta, get me everything you have on the Grangers, and Granger Aeronautics. Jace Granger? I'm Shana Bradford. Please. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for meeting me. Vidal Duncan suggested I contact you. He said that you can help with Granger Aeronautics. I know I can help. I've familiarized myself with you, your brothers, and your company on the way over here. - You did? - Yes. You're a lawyer. In California. Graduated top of your class at UCLA. Could have worked private, but you chose to work for the public sector. Your brother Caden is a musical genius who has quite the following. And your brother Dalton is known in the European circuit as quite the ladies man. A billionaire who is often referred to as. Cocoa Puff. Granger Aeronautics is the fourth largest employer in the state with government contracts up for renewal. The lesser known fact is that the company is deep in the red with competitors outbidding you at every opportunity. What I don't know, and what you need to tell me, is why are three men who once swore never to work for Granger Aeronautics suddenly doing so? Why are you here? My grandfather asked the three of us to take over the running of his company. We promised to do so, and it is a promise that I intend to keep. For how long? Excuse me? How long? After you turn the company around, will you and your brothers abandon the company, shareholders, the staff, and go back to your old lives? Just what do you expect from me, Miss Bradford? What do the employees of Granger Aeronautics expect of you, Mr. Granger? They worked hard for your grandfather. They want someone who plans to do right by them, and not leave them in the cold. They want a leader. I can only speak for myself. But I'm staying. If you take the job, I think it would be best if you worked on the premises. I'm surprised you would want your employees to know that the company was in a dire enough situation that I had to be called in. They already know. Okay. I'll handle your case. I appreciate that. For a moment there, I thought you were turning me down. Almost. You want to know what I think? Yes. Granger Aeronautics has always been your legacy. But I think today you realized that it's your destiny. Now, I do have one request before we get started. That I order dessert. I have a weakness for chocolate. So, how'd it go with, uh, Shana Bradford? Is she gonna help us? Does she look good? None of your business, Cocoa Puff. - Cocoa Puff. - Offensive. But because I don't want you to blurt out something off color when you meet her, I'll warn you. She's gorgeous. She's beyond professional and already has an incredible grasp of our situation. By the time she moves into her office here tomorrow, she may know more about us than we do. She's moving in? I bet you she doesn't know where my tattoo is. I wouldn't count on it. Okay, sis, you've been blowing up my phone all day. What's going on? Dad is thinking about marrying a woman he met at the farmer's market. What? I didn't know he was seeing anyone. Exactly. I'm sure it's just a phase. I saw that sparkle in his eye when he was telling me about her. I think it's more than a phase. Then we'll stop it. Whoa, it sounds like you had a bad day. Why do you say that? Because you sound like you could chew up a couple of people and spit them out. And I would begin with a number of people I interviewed today. They were lying through their teeth about not recognizing this guy. He's hiding out here someplace with his son, I can feel it. Then I'm sure you'll find them. Listen, I'm in the middle of research, and I really hav... Whoa. Wait. Research? I thought you were taking a break? I was, but I got a client who needs me. Don't they all? What makes this one so special that you would give up a month of fun in the sun? I didn't say he was special. He? Sounds interesting. I never said anything about a he. I think you just told on yourself. Jace Granger is now the CEO of Granger Aeronautics. I met with him today and agreed to help him bring his company around. So again I ask, what's so special? A number of things. But most of all, his integrity. It was a deathbed promise he made to his grandfather that he intends to keep. You now how I am about those sort of things. Yes, I know. Is he good looking? Yes, he is good looking. And? That's it? Jonathan ruined you for any other man. He didn't ruin me. Look, I'm focused on my business. And the last date you went on was a stakeout where you were trying to bust a cheating husband. And I was successful, I might add. Men are not to be trusted, unless their name is Ben Bradford. I need a shower. Don't expect back in Virginia for another two weeks. In the meantime, keep an eye on Dad and the veggie lady. Jace Granger. Weren't you gonna tell me your grandfather passed away? No. You two weren't close, and he didn't include you in the will, if that's why you're calling. I'm calling because I heard you're back at the company. It's what I always wanted for you. That's what you wanted for yourself... The money from the company and in on my trust fund. Jace, when we were married, I had just as much money as you. Yeah, and then you spent it all and then went in on mine. I like nice things. No, you like expensive things, then you choose not to work to pay for them. There was no reason for me to work. If I'd just given in and stayed pregnant, everything would have been fine. You aborted our child behind my back. Eve, let's end this call while we can still be civil. And do me a favor. Delete my number. Do you need anything else, Mr. Granger? One thing. Uh, gonna have someone coming to work with us tomorrow. Her name's Shana Bradford. You'll make sure that she has everything she needs? - Of course. - Thank you, Melissa. - Thank you. Goodnight. - Enjoy your evening. Good morning. Thought I'd be the first here. I half expected you to sleep here. I almost did. It was a long night. Uh, my team was just finishing up. Kent, Bruce, this is Jace Granger. Kent has already pulled extensive bios on all of your top executives, and Bruce is my computer expert. I'll be using my own server in case your grandfather wasn't just being paranoid about not trusting his colleagues. Good idea. Welcome aboard. Your assistant Melissa was very helpful this morning. Has she been here a long time with the company? No, she replaced my granddad's assistant after she retired a few months ago. She seems like a nice lady. - Who? - Your assistant, Melissa. Oh, yeah, she appears rather efficient. Can we talk privately about something? Of course. What is it? Your libido and my hormones. Excuse me? Don't look so shocked. Those two things seem to be working overtime with us right now, and they have no place in the office. And since I have a strict policy not to get personally involved with any of my clients, they have no place anywhere. I promise to try to keep my libido in check. Thank you. Now, I'd like to meet your brothers. Did you even get a chance to read the report before going to McQueen's? Shana Bradford, these are my brothers, - Caden and Dalton. - Dalton Granger. And I wish I'd met you first. It wouldn't have mattered if you had. Nice. Burn. Mr. Granger, everyone is ready for you. All right. Granger Aeronautics has lost a number of major clients over the past 12 months. I intend to find out why. For that, I've brought on Shana Bradford. Her firm has a stellar reputation for reinventing companies. - Cal? - Cal Arrington. VP of products and design. I agree that we need to consider better marketing. But Granger clients are firm. Do you honestly feel she is necessary? I do. The floor is yours. Good morning. Please turn to page three. Both Dad and Granddad would be proud of how you handled the old guard today. You're a true leader. I bet Cal's concerned because he hasn't brought in a new project in over eight months. And how would you know that? You're not the only one spending his time reading. Dalton. Well, Freeman's pissed. I could hear the sound of his teeth grinding. I think he feels threatened but I'm not sure as to why. I mean, I know that no one likes change, but I feel like there's a little something more to it. I'm sure Miss Bradford will make it her job as to find out why. Yes, I will. Hey, you got a second? All right, what's going on? I can't... stand being in Sutton Hills anymore. I'm gonna look for a place in town. To be honest, you lasted a lot longer than I thought you would. Oh, I was worried that you thought I wouldn't uphold my promise. Now, look, I don't think that. Losing Mom was hard on all of us, Dalton, but especially you. I realize that. You were the youngest, and extremely close to Mom. I worried about you when you wouldn't go see Dad. I thought you doubted Dad's innocence. I'd be lying if I said the thought didn't cross my mind. But, no, Dad would never hurt Mom. I know that. And if I find a place that I like, I'm gonna buy it. Sounds like a good plan. Oh, and I... I like your Shana Bradford. My Shana Bradford? Impressive. See you at home. Yeah. ♪♪ Oh! Sorry. I wasn't looking where I was going. I got a little hungry and thought I'd grab something from the vending machine. I shouldn't have skipped lunch. No, you shouldn't have. I was on my way over there, too. Titus Freeman resigned. It's not surprising. I'm sure you read that a rival company just outbid you twice. Yes. Barnes Aeronautic. Our biggest competitor. I suspect your grandfather was onto something. Someone's passing trade secrets. Do you really need that many to tide you over? These will hold me over until dinner. My dad made a pot of spaghetti, and he's bringing it over this evening. You're close? Yes. Very. - Well... - Well? I'd better get back. I'll see you later. Shana. I'm trying. So am I. I guess you need to try a little harder. Damn it! Damn it, drop. That's not how you do it. I thought you had happy hour drinks with Dalton. I was, but he found someone and three's a crowd. Figured I'd come back here, put my business degree to use, and get some reading in when I heard you banging out your sexual frustrations on the ending machine. You're imagining things. Oh. So we're not supposed to know you have a thing for Shana? O-Okay. Just know that type of frustration needs to be taken care of. Goodnight. Hold the elevator, please. You're eager to get started this morning. Just excited it's almost the weekend. You have big plans? No, actually. Do you? My brothers and I are going to visit our dad. Oh... That's nice. What are you doing? What I should have done last night. I want you. I know it's wasted longing on my part since you made it very clear we can't get involved, but there is something that I have to do. And I hope by doing so, it'll get you out of my system. I believe it will. When I'm done... you'll be okay. And you'll be okay? Yes. ♪♪ That can't happen again, Jace. I want it, too. But I know better. Office romances are a bad idea. Trust me on this. ♪♪ Jace, what do you think about a party where everyone comes naked? Yes, that sounds good. What's so funny? You are. You just agreed to a naked party. My mind was elsewhere. Come have drinks with us tonight. Working way too hard to be productive anymore. I can't go. I've got a date, so I'll be home late, or not at all. - We see Dad tomorrow. - I remember. - So, Jace. - Yes. McQueen's? Beer. Fries. - Yes. - Great. And you should invite Shana to come out with us. The worse that she can do is say no. She's definitely gonna say no to me. Maybe she won't. Caden and I are going to... McQueen's. I heard the food is good and the drinks are even better. ♪♪ Nice way to kick off the weekend. You, uh, want to join us? Shana? Yes. I'd love to. Okay. - Uh-huh. - Take a minute. I'll try. - You just don't do that. - I know. Uh, uh, what are your plans for this weekend? I bet you have a date. Yes, I do have a date. I'm looking forward to it. The first two weeks on a new job are always the toughest and busiest. Granger Aeronautics is no exception. And what's going on with that? It's going great. I should have your first report to you next week. So... you feel good about Granger making a turn around? Yes, as long as the recommended changes are made. I don't see why that would be. Right, Jace? Right... Jace? I don't agree to anything blindly, so that depends on what they are. I don't expect you to jump at my every recommendation, Jace, but I'm hoping you keep an open mind. I don't put a Band-Aid on a problem, I fix it. I'm good. Speaking of good, the dessert is a lemon cake with ice cream. Any one of you want to share one with me? You're in a bad mood. Yes. - Rough week? - Yes. How's the CEO? I don't want to talk about it. What's going on with you? Any new leads? Yes. I caught the guy this morning, and little Marco, I returned him to his mother. Just some paperwork, then I get to come home. Congratulations, Jules, that's great. Dad's gonna be so proud. Speaking of Dad, when are you going to the farmer's market with him? Tomorrow. I'll let you know how it goes. So good to see you all. Jace. Caden. And Dalton. It's good to see you too, Dad. I can't believe some of these people... came to the service. And how much they've aged. I guess... Guess we've aged too, huh? Who is this? Think he said his name is Ivan Greene. I hear he's running for mayor. What was he doing at Granddad's funeral? His dad worked for us. I let him go just before your mother died. I'm surprised he even came. I'm surprised a lot of these people came. Is that... Is that little Shiloh? Yes. I was trying to get a picture of Hannah, but she got in the way. Uh-huh, looks to me like you had the camera pointed right at her, but I don't know nothin' about nothin'. - Yeah, you're wrong. - Mm-hm. - I'll take it out and... - No, no, don't take it. Why? I'm mean, it's... it's nice of her to attend the services. Yeah, real nice. So, how are things at Granger Aeronautics? What do you know about Cal Arrington, Dad? Not much. He and Titus were hired after I left, uh... they moved up the ranks quickly, and... If you're asking if I think Arrington can be trusted, the answer is no. Listen. The only people that can be trusted right now... are your brothers. Is that a new shirt? Uh-huh. Jeans? You normally wear khakis, right? What's going on here? What do you mean? What are you doing here? And before you say another word, neither you nor your sister can lie worth a damn. I want to meet Mona. Meet? Or check out and report back to Jules? You do know your daughters. Okay. I'm gonna go see if they have some ice cream. You do that. Hey, there she is. Good afternoon, miss. - Hi. - How are you? - I'm better now. - Oh, good. - How about you? - I'm good. - Um, do you like tangerines? - I do. Tangerines in North Carolina. Who'd have thunk it? I love it. -BEN: Here. Tell me what you think of this one. She seems really nice. She's also blind. As in can't see? Yeah. She was the victim of a drunk driving accident years ago. The kid driving died. That's a lot to go through. Her husband left her for his secretary. - Typical. -And now has two kids. Mona's better off without him. I know she's not Mom. But if Dad has to dote on someone new, Mona's more deserving than most. Maybe, but I'm still not comfortable with it. It's an adjustment. What's that? It's my lunch. Hannah made it. You got Hannah making your lunch? She offered. Don't worry. I'll be moving into my own place soon, you'll only have to compete with Caden. I know you're jealous 'cause I'm Hanna's favorite. You know I don't have any favorites. Shana wants to meet us privately tonight. In her office. She asked us not to tell anyone. Thank you. I know I'm still your favorite. Thanks for meeting me. Caden? He had performances he couldn't reschedule. My initial assessment of the company. There's a traitor in the company. Looks that way. - You knew? - I had a hunch. Granger Aeronautics was the number one company to produce aircraft parts. And recently, a young competitor who couldn't possibly have the experience to so precisely outbid you, had done so. Twice. The first red flag. I'll have my team investigate further, and we must alert the FBI. The FBI? Misappropriation of trade secrets is a federal offense. Do we know who's doing it? No. And we could be looking at more than one person. The FBI team will be led by Marcel Eaton. He used to be a police officer with my father in Boston. So he'll keep us in the loop. Your Dad is a cop? Yes. Retired. Well, now I know why Granddad wanted us to take over the company, at least until Dad gets back. Granddad believed our father would be set free. Part of our promise was to see to that. There were other recommendations in my report. Yes. People need their jobs now more than ever, Shana. No company can afford to bear the expense of employees not doing their jobs. I'll meet with them and I'll lay down the law. Jace's law. I'll hold them responsible to their department. Jace's law? I am going to McQueen's. I need a drink. You two have a good night. How long will it take? What I mean is... how much longer do you think I'll be your client? I thought we were past this.

I'm ending my contract with you. - You can't do that? - Why can't I? Because I... need you. I'll give you my answer on Monday. I had a great time today. I hope pizza was okay. I...

No. Especially if they make the wrong one. ♪♪ Come in. Are you gonna let this attraction stop you from doing the right thing with Granger? Are you? Can I ask you something? If things were different... If we had met under normal circumstances... Would you be fighting this thing between us? No. Then why are you doing so now? Your... Your rules? Considering everything, I think you should make an exception for us. Why? I think we should become involved. Are you out of your mind? No. My professional role at Granger would be jeopardized and no longer effective. We need to retain our business relationship. Agreed. By day, in the office, it's all business. But after hours...

Uh, not right now, but I might think of something a little later. Just let me know. I, uh, aim to please. Hmm. And how long have you been working here Miss Brandy? Three years. I started right out of college. - Both my parents worked here. - Hmm. We're a Granger family. I bet. Miss Booker, I believe you're needed at your desk. - Mr. Granger. - Melissa. You needed something from me, Jace? Yes. I want you to head up security. That department needs a fresh set of eyes. Consider it done. Something else? Yes. About Brandy? We gotta draw a line on certain things. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Have you drawn any lines, Jace? 'Cause I know she didn't come home last night. And you and Wonder Woman were both a little late this morning. Coincidence? Don't be a pain in the ass, Dalton. Well, then you stay out of my business. And I will stay out of yours. Deal? Yes. Deal. Yes, Melissa. Actually, It's Brandy. Melissa had to step out. Your wife is on line two. - I don't have a wife. - That's what I thought. - But the lady says differently. -Thank you. What do you want, Eve? Just a loan. I promise I'll pay you back. Oh, you're getting a job? Surely... you don't expect me to work? How much? Ten thousand. I'll give you five. Give me? So I don't have to pay it back? - Can you? - Well, no but... Then why pretend? Why are you being so nice? Because I am nice. And you caught me in a good mood. But this will be the last time you get a penny out of me, no matter what kind of mood I'm in. Good-bye, Eve. Hey, Bruce. What's going on? A bug? It's imperative that I know when it was activated. I really need to know when. When, Bruce? You mean to tell me this pen was broadcasting a video of your whole office? Since when? It was only activated this morning. Although I've had that pen in my office since I moved in. Bruce caught it as soon as it turned on. Well, that's lucky for us. For all of us. I, for one, am a bit insulted that they didn't think I was worth spying on. They just assumed that I didn't know an thing? - You don't. - Word? Bruce caught someone trying to hack into my system. He blocked them before they learned anything, but it was someone in the building. The hack prompted him to scan for bugs, and he found that. Melissa helped set up your office, didn't she? With a little help from Brandy. So, basically, everyone is a suspect. Not everyone. You're not. Hmm. Thank you. I just came to tuck you in. And then I'll leave. Yeah? Come away with me this weekend. Where? My cabin. In the mountains near Shenandoah. No bugs. Just you and me. That sounds nice. Okay. Don't... tempt me. Shana, go to sleep. You really just came here to tuck me in? Yes. Now close your eyes. ♪♪ Welcome home, sis. - I missed you. - I missed you, too. I cannot believe it is my first weekend back and both you and Dad are deserting me? Don't waste your time trying to make us feel guilty. Now, you know if the shoe was on the other foot... I'd wear it proudly and not give you a backwards glance. Speaking of shoes... I'm going to be working on a new case this weekend. I'll be putting on my favorite pair of stilettos, wearing my shortest dress, and going bar-hopping. - Hmm. -Some lowlife is turning one night stands into movie night on the internet. Oh, well, I hope you catch him. And please take care of yourself. Don't I always? ♪♪ What is this? It's your drink. I ordered it for you. You looked a little thirsty. Thanks, but no thanks. I order my own. What if you loaded that drink with ecstasy? Do I look stupid to you? No. You look highly intelligent. In that case, an intelligent woman would never accept a drink from a stranger. Okay. Then order your own drink. Can you please get her whatever she wants and put it on my tab? Vesper. What is your name? You don't need to know my name. And I definitely don't need to know yours. Now, why would you think that? Because I'm looking for a man. Ah, well, last time I checked, I have all the necessary parts. A particular man. And you're not him. Ouch. Thanks. I needed that. Hey. Hold on a second. What if I wanted to see you again? Find me. Lady, I don't know who you are, but I'm damn sure gonna find you. Describe what you see. I hear something. Uh, well... there's some folks playing ball over at the lake, and fluffy white clouds in the sky... and a beautiful woman wearing a yellow sun dress that matches her golden-brown eyes perfectly. And lips... that I have been tempted to kiss for a long time. Ben, you shouldn't say such things. Shh. No. I should. I will. Because I plan to pursue you until you are my life. All day, every day. You need a woman - who will be there... - Who is exactly... like you. I really wish I could I could see you. You will. The doctor said it could happen. And even if it doesn't, I'll be right here. Wow. - Peacocks. - I'm excited. Yeah. I love it. How long have you had it? Well, just a couple years. Since I got divorced. I've only been here three times. My family have one about four miles away, but nobody wanted to come after my mom died. - Hmm. - So we sold it. I'd always loved the country, though. It's gorgeous. - Thank you for bringing me here. - Hmm. And now... dinner. You cook, too? Mm-hmm. So why did you leave? You had family here, the company, community. That was years ago. Before. Things change when your father is found guilty of murder, and your mother... The trial was brutal on all of us. Our friends, or so-called friends, they deserted us. Caden's girlfriend was all but banned from acknowledging his existence, and Dalton was the youngest. The baby. He went off the rails. He got a football scholarship. Made a lot of money there. And then he blew through it all. My grandfather was so concerned, how withheld his trust fund. Yeah, they didn't speak for years. Not until he called us all back here. And you? I'm the oldest. I had to grow up. Be the man. I tried to be there for my brothers. Keep my promises to my granddad. To my dad. You and your promises. Do you wanna know why I accepted the job? Because of you and your promises. It means everything to me that you have the integrity to keep that promise. I try every day to keep mine. Your mom? She mad my sister and I a promise to be good to our father. To help him. To succeed. I think that's been the driving force behind me all these years. My mom was amazing. Her death nearly crippled my father. As time went on, he grew stronger. And now... he claims to be in love with a woman he barely knows that he met at a farmer's market. I'm just slightly concerned. Have you ever been in love? I thought I was. Once. Jonathan... treated me like a queen. He made me think I was the woman of his dreams. We dated for nine months, when I found out he was using me to spy for his boss, one of my client's biggest competitors. I am so sorry. That would make anyone terrified to trust again. He almost broke me. But Bruce and Ken saved me. Now I know work is only for business, and affairs are only for sex. You? Love. You were married. Marriage cured me... of a lot of my illusions about love. Then I guess we finally understand each other. What this is and... isn't. Doesn't mean it still can't be fun, though. I got this.

What's this urgent meeting, and where's everyone else at? I don't know any more than you do. Okay. Hypothetically speaking. If a friend wanted to track down a woman who he just met, but he didn't even know her name, how would one go about doing that? - Private detective, obviously. - Aha. That's an unusual amount of effort for you... You mean, for his friend. Right. That's so Dalton. Always doing favors for his friends. Relax, okay. People change. Jace, Caden, Dalton? This is Marcel Eaton, the FBI agent I was telling you about. Good morning. Six a.m. this morning, federal agents raided the homes of Melissa Swanson, Titus Freeman, and Cal Errington. Errington and Swanson were taken in. Freeman's whereabouts are unknown. Freeman and Errington, sure. But Melissa? She was Freeman's lover, had been for more than a year. She was spying for him. Freeman was trying to force a merger by making Granger fail. He's the mastermind behind it all. I need to have a meeting with my executives immediately before the media gets wind of this and there's chaos. I'm sure the FBI will find Freeman. Shh. - Mr. Granger. - Brandy, Shelton. Working late again, I see. I thought I'd try my hand at, I don't know, putting together pieces of this puzzle. There seem to be links missing. I'm sure you'll figure it out. - You handled the media well. - Thanks. I was just sitting in my office thinking about the weekend. Any particular part? All of it. - And what? - I want more. Now. Not here. Come with me. ♪♪ Caden, someone's here to see you. - Who is it? - Shiloh Timmons. Hello, Caden. What do you want, Shiloh? - We need to talk. - I don't want to hear it. - Doesn't matter... - It does matter. I can't let you hate me any longer. You don't have a choice. I believed in you. Trusted you. And I loved you. Damn it, Shiloh, I waited days in that hotel room for you. And then I saw those pictures with you half naked on some private beach with some businessman your daddy was trying to woo. - No, that wasn't... - I don't want to hear it. You mean nothing to me. And I can't stand the sight of you. - What are you doing down there? - I can't find my panties. You don't have them, do you? No. Why would I have them? Heaven forbid they get lost somewhere in your father's office. That's odd. This sofa has a secret compartment. They were stuck in my shirt. What do we have here? What is it? It's a letter from Yolanda Green dated 16 years ago. She's writing to inform my father that my mother was having an affair with her husband. Do you know the Greens? Michael Green worked for my father for years. - My father fired him. - When was that? About two months before my mother was killed. May I read the letter? This woman is threatening your mother. Was this used as evidence in your father's defense? I don't think so. It's the first I'm hearing about it. Michael and Yolanda Green, they weren't at my grandfather's funeral, but their son, Ivan, was. The Ivan Green whose running for mayor? Yeah. To think that the prosecution built an entire case on the idea that my father was having an affair on my mother, killed her during a heated argument, because she wouldn't give him a divorce. Why didn't your father say anything? Clear his name and move doubt from him to Yolanda? All it would have taken is reasonable doubt. I'm not sure. But first thing tomorrow, I'm gonna ask my father. Jace, what's wrong? I was in your office yesterday, Dad. I found the secret compartment in the sofa. I saw the file. Why didn't you tell the authorities that it was Mom having the affair, not you? It could have cleared you. Or strengthened the prosecutor's claim of a motive. I'm not gonna risk it. Look, she was the mother of my sons, and I'm not gonna drag her name through the mud when there's no guarantee that it would clear me. But you had that letter from Yolanda Green threatening Mom. Yes. But she and Michael Green had ironclad alibis. They were on a cruise working on their marriage. They coulda hired somebody. We need to find out. Enough is enough. Whether you want to or not, we're going to prove you're innocent. No, damn it! I am trying to protect you. Okay? Now, I believe that your mom was involved in something other than the affair. I don't know what, but it got her killed. Promise me that you'll let it go and you won't tell your brothers. I can't make you that promise, Dad. I won't tell them now, but they need to know soon. And if you won't tell them, then I will. I'm sorry. Mr. Granger hasn't arrived yet. Oh, but here's Miss Bradford. Maybe she can help you? She works closely with Mr. Jace Granger. I just bet she does. Hi. I'm Mrs. Eve Granger, Jace's wife. - Ex-wife. - Jace, I had to come. I could not let you deal with this on your own. Uh, what are we, chopped liver? Last I looked, he wasn't by himself. The media has been reporting on how those... horrid people... are trying to ruin your business and betray you. Betrayal's something you know a lot about, isn't it? Wow, Jace, I... Why are you being so unforgiving? Oh, ho, hoo! Somebody give this lady an Oscar, please. Evil Evie strikes again. My ex-sister-in-law can be quite the character sometimes. Apparently. No way you can stay in Sutton Hills for a week. But I need somewhere to stay. I had to leave Los Angeles for a while. - To avoid who? - Some goons. Slashed my tires. And then someone tried to run me off the road. Why didn't you call the police? I didn't have enough proof. What good would a week do here? It would give Maurice time to convince her that there's nothing between us. - Go to your parents. - We're not on good terms. We're not on good terms. Eve, I'll put you up in a hotel for one week. And that's only because I can't deal with any more chaos. But this is it. Thank you, baby. - You gonna come visit me? - No. And I'm telling the hotel not to let you charge anything to the room. Security will see you out and will know you're never to be let in here again. - I like her. - Who? Dad's Mona. I met her when I joined them for breakfast. Why are you just eating a plain piece of bread and drinking ginger ale? I woke up this morning not feeling so well. Oh, tell me, did you find the guy this weekend? Yes. You should have seen his expression when I handcuffed his naked ass to the bed. Thought I was about to get kinky. Instead, the police showed up and hauled him to jail. Well, I'm glad you found him. Seems like you had a productive weekend. How was your weekend with Jace Granger? I think I'm falling in love with him, Jules. In fact, I know I am. Goodness. I hope he's worthy. I believe he is. You know there could be another reason why you're nauseous. I'm on the pill. Oh, no. I came down with something and took antibiotics. - You don't really... - We should see if the hotel gift shop carries pregnancy tests. I do. Come on. Yeah, he looked really good behind that desk, like I always wanted. I was ready to give him that baby he always wanted. I would move into Sutton Hills, make it my own, fire that heifer Hannah, of course. Yeah. She would never raise any baby of mine. And over lunch, I heard... that Shana woman you were suspicious of him sleeping with, she's probably pregnant. Of course, I'm not leaving. It's probably gonna be a lot harder to get rid of her now. Why haven't you called me? I was gonna tell you about this guy I met at the bar, but we'll get to that later. Did you take it yet? Yep. I was right, wasn't I? Yes. Yippee! I'm gonna be an auntie. - Are you happy or... - I want to be. Jace and I haven't even talked about us. - It's been all business. -Well... Jules, I assured him I was on the pill. But what if he doesn't feel the same way? What if he thinks I'm trying to trap him? What if he doesn't think that? Then there's a chance. You're gonna tell him, right? Yes, of course. He has a right to know. - I needed that. - So did I. Brandy said you had a lunch thing with your sister. Yes. Oh. Sorry, baby, I have a meeting I gotta run out to. What about dinner tonight? My place. I have something important I need to talk to you about. There's something important I want to talk to you about too. Oh, okay. Is everything okay with Eve? Your father? Still figuring things out with my dad. And as for Eve, she needed a place to stay, so I put her up in a hotel. Very generous of you. I'm with you now. You don't have to worry about Eve, okay? - See you at seven? - Yeah. See you at seven. Shelton. Anything you need? Uh, no, I was... I was just leaving. Or... I was just leaving something on Miss Booker's desk and then leaving. - Let's leave together. - Yeah. Well, I'm over that way. You have a good night, Mr. Granger. Good night, Shelton. Hello? Oh, hi, Kent. No, I haven't checked my email in a while. Sorry. I've been distracted. Of course. Yeah, I'll check it right now. No worries. I'll call you right back. Thanks, Kent. Talk to you soon. I can't believe we came back here tonight just to get some documents for you to read. What is happening to us? You could have stayed at McQueen's. Uh... I didn't see anyone that I was interested in. Keep your voice down. Jace may be busy. What do you mean? His car is still in the lot. But he said he had to be somewhere by seven. Oh. Shana? I'm trying to find Jace. I can go check his office. Ain't no lights on down there. Where would he be without his car? Could he be with Eve? - At her hotel? - Doubt it. Can you check? If he's not there, then I'm worried. Why? Kent did some digging on another employee, and what he found was disturbing. He's covered his tracks well and has no idea we're onto him, but, look, I have a feeling he'll do anything to make sure he's not found out. What employee are you talking about? Look on the bright side, Jace. You found Titus Freeman. He's been my guest here for some time now. What's that? - What? - What are you doing, Vidal? Why? You messed up my plan, Jace. So this is a very rushed Plan B... A murder-suicide between the two of you. Agent Marcel is doing a sweep of the building. - What do you suggest we do? - I wish I knew. I'm still wrapping my head around Vidal Duncan being an embezzler. My suspicions had been focused on Shelton Fields. He was always acting strangely. - Lurking around Brandy's desk? -That's because they're having an affair. - How do you know that? -That's why she's not sleeping with me, she's sleeping with him. Marcel? You are so clueless and so goddamn trusting. Even with your wife. Do you think Jace could still be somewhere in the building? Shana! I found this near his car. When you and eve came home for Thanksgiving four years ago, she approached me. She wanted me to get you to move back here to work with the family business. And I... I made her prove just how badly she wanted that... by making her my lover. Your wife, Jace, she can be a real freak in the bedroom. I enjoyed it so much that we continued the affair when you moved to L.A. That is the look of a man doing the math. I'll save you the time. The baby Eve aborted was mine. - No! - Yes. She figured your marriage would be over if you found out, so... And Eve came over here to break up you and Shana, but she didn't do a very good job. But don't worry if you're mad at Eve. Because after I'm done with the two of you, she's next. Marcel just got the lab work. The syringe was used recently to inject a powerful sedative. - This can't be happening. - Holy shit. - What, Dalton? - The tracker on his phone. Looks like they're already looking for you. How do you know they're looking for me? Because your ex-wife keeps calling me. Because everyone is calling her to see if the two of you are holed up in her hotel room reconciling. If you didn't want to get caught, then why did you suggest that we hire Shana? Well, someone was going to dig when your grandfather died. I just... I wanted to appear helpful. But you and Shana started carrying on. Eve was no match for a pregnant Shana. Pregnant? You didn't know? Yeah. Yeah. I'm fairly sure it's yours, but you won't get to meet this one either. Ah! FBI! Don't move! Get down on the ground! Do not move! - Clear! - Clear! All clear! Oh! How did you find me? Thank James Bond over here. He put a tracker in your phone. Yeah, you should. I'm beginning to enjoy this spy thing. I am so glad to see you. I've never been so scared in my life. Are you pregnant? What makes you think that? I'll explain later. What I want to know is, are you pregnant? Yes. I just found out today. I'm sorry. I was on the pill, but I was taking antibiotics that... I guess effected the potency of it. Don't apologize, baby. I love children. And I'm going to love it just as much as I love you. That's what I wanted to tell you tonight. I love you. Jace, I love you, too. No second thoughts about staying? None. Made a promise to save Granger Aeronautics, and... thank you for helping me keep that promise. My pleasure. I've got another promise to fulfill. I've got a feeling that learning more about what happened to my mother'll be a lot harder. But I can do anything with you by my side. And your brothers. Speaking of family, when am I gonna meet yours? You can meet Dad this weekend. Jules just took a case in Seattle, so she'll be gone a while. What does she do? She's a private investigator. Hmm. Is she any good? 'Cause Dalton was looking for another... Why? Never mind. I don't want to know. Yeah, Jules is the best. Of course, I'm biased. Speaking of biased, I'm glad you're the woman that's giving birth to a Granger. Is there any way I can convince you to become one, too? Become a Granger? Yeah. It's never been more clear to me what I want in my life. This child... and you. Only you. That's my wife. So, will you marry me? Yes... I will marry you. I love you, Shana.
