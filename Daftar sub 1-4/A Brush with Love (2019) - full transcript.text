And just have fun! There are no rights or wrongs in art. There are no mistakes, there's no end goal, or perfect finished product. What we're trying to do here is just take what's in your heart and put it on the canvas. Miss Jamie? Yes, Lizzie? How do we know what's in our hearts? Oh, well, we don't always know. But that's why we're here, right? To figure it out. 'Kay. [laughs] - Oh, sorry. - Sorry. Excuse me, my fault. My fault. Thanks. ♪ So. What do you think? I think it's amazing. We could build out multiple rooms, we could do reception, a gallery so we could have art shows and community events. I mean, I think it's perfect. And this is just our second location. Wait till you see what I've planned for our third and fourth. [laughs] - You're so excited. - I am. It's what I love to do. I've spent my life building businesses, and we all know this past year of retirement has been hard on me. Hard on all of us. [laughs] This is a dream come true. Jamie needs help expanding Canvas Creations, and I need to be working again, and you get me out of the house. Okay? Yes. How do we make this a reality? Let's talk terms. Okay. Thank you. Have I told you in the last five minutes how much I love you? No, not in the last five minutes. Aww. - Should I come back later? - No, we'll stop. [laughs] It's not our fault, spring is in the air. Yeah, which would be a great excuse, except you guys were like this last winter, and summer, and fall. I gotta go. Sugar? Mmmwah. [laughs] - Bye. - Bye. Ooh, you two are cute. [laughs] Here you go. Thanks. Well, maybe it's time to start dating again? I mean, it's been a year. Oh, what? - Please, just change the subject. - Change the subject? All right, speaking of subject change... Mmhmm? I just toured a space that would be perfect for the second Canvas Creations. That's great, but. Canvas Creations was supposed to be the thing you did on the side of painting, and if you expand, you're not gonna have time to paint, or submit to showcases and exhibitions. [gasps] Which brings me to my exciting news. I just learned that with three weeks till the Cherry Blossom Arts Festival, the festival lost its usual venue of The Windsor Manor, and is switching to the Botanical Gardens. Oh, that is very exciting. Which means that as head and sole employee of the special events permitting office, I'm gonna be working directly with the organizers of the arts festival. I could put in a good word for you. For your submission for the emerging artist showcase. That's very sweet. And I do appreciate your meddling. But I didn't submit. What? Why not? Because I'm not painting, and I haven't been in almost a year. And even if I was painting, every year I submit to the festival and get rejected. I know it's hard, but you have to keep trying. You can't give up. I don't want to. But every year, I watch another artist win the festival's prize, a solo show in Paris. My dream. And I'm happy for them, I... I mean, I really am. It's just, it's starting to feel like it's never gonna happen for me. And this is my dream. I don't know how to make it more than a dream. I've got an idea. Come. [door bell jingles] I'm back! [laughs] Not that I'm complaining, 'cause this is literally my favourite place on earth, but what are we doing here? We are getting you supplies. Ooh, for what, exactly? I think I already own almost everything in the store. You don't have poster board. And why do I need poster board? Ooh, for my sixth grade science project? Remember four years ago when I went through that rough patch and I hated my job working for the event planner, and had no luck dating? I remember a lot of ice cream sundae pity parties. They were delicious. [laughs] And then, I heard about that job at the special events permitting office, my dream job, and then I got it, and then about a month later, I met Tom. And I'm happy for you, but I'm just a little confused. How's that relate to poster board? It wasn't luck, it wasn't destiny. I made it happen with... No... - A vision board. - A vision board? I made that vision board, and then all my dreams came true. They came true because you took action and went after what you wanted. Not because you collaged. I took action because my vision board helped me realize what I wanted. Ava. No. Jamie. As an artist, I'm sure you'll agree that images are very powerful, and when you have a clear vision of what you want, you'll find a clear path to achieving it. Besides, what have you got to lose? My artistic dignity. We'll take everything. We're not taking any of it. Oh, this too. No need to thank me. I wasn't going to. If you're walking me home to get those collaging supplies in my door... Actually, there's another reason I'm walking you home, and I'm sorry I waited until now to bring it up. Oh, you finally rented out your unit. That's what I wanted to talk to you about. I know it's sudden, but it kinda just happened overnight. Hey, neighbour. Please tell me your brother is not my new... I'm sorry. I know Max drives you crazy. He doesn't drive me crazy. Okay yeah, he drives me crazy. But you know how much trouble I was having finding a sublet. And he never stays anywhere for long. He'll be gone before you know it. Promise? Hey. [grunts] [laughs] Hey. Oh. Okay. [laughs uncomfortably] - So, I thought you were in San Diego. - Oh, that was last spring. I was in Tucson, and then Boise, and then Ava mentioned a temp job back here, and I thought "why not?" Max got a job as a landscape architect. Groundskeeper. You got a master's degree in landscape architecture to then work as a groundskeeper at the botanical gardens? Where Jamie might be displaying her work next month at the Cherry Blossom Arts Festival. If she vision boards. Not only will I see you at the gardens, but I will see you at home, too. Would you believe it? Great big world, and we end up living right next to each other. I really can't believe it... Okay. Who knows, maybe you'll even like having him as your neighbour. And if achieving your dreams isn't reason enough to vision board, you can always collage a picture of Max moving away. Well, that's reason enough for me. You need help with those? You know what, this is the last of it. Um, and I'm sure Jamie doesn't mind helping me out? Thank you. Ready? Let's go. [uncomfortably] Oh yeah. All right. Good luck, you two. Really, no matter how long it's been since I've seen you, you're still the same. Flecks of paint in your hair and everything. Well, I am a painter... That's what I love about you. You know, the... the paint. Right. Welcome home. Thanks, neighbour. Oh, if you ever want to come by for a beer, I microbrew my own. Oh, that is a tempting offer I'll keep in mind. Yeah, and I'll do the same. [sighs] [knocking at door] Yes? Hey, you forgot your... ...Collaging supplies. [sighs] So... You are collaging. Not yet, but more and more, I'm thinking about it. Uh... Thanks. [phone ringing] Hey, Dad. Hi, honey. The real estate agent just sent over the lease. We need to decide by the end of the week. Well, why wait? I mean, the space is exactly what we're looking for. Let's sign. You don't want to give it a little bit more thought? No. Why? Are you having second thoughts? No. I'm certain I wanna do this. I love building this out and getting to work with you, but I wanna make sure you're sure. Well, I'm sure. I'll look over the lease now. Love you. Love you. Bye. [sighs] Good morning! Morning. You going for a run? Yup. Me too. [sighs] Have a great run. Jamie, call me crazy, but I'm starting to think that you're unhappy that we're neighbours. Did I do something to bother you? You mean besides a lifetime of pranks and jokes at my expense? Max, every time I'm around you, I get hurt or humiliated. Woah. That is not fair. Okay, give me one example. Okay. Third grade. You nicknamed me Jamie Smellyman. [laughs] We were kids. Which stuck with me through high school when you wrote me love letters for an entire year to prank me into thinking I had a secret admirer. - That was... - A joke? Oh, I know, Max. With you, everything's a joke. On me. Every time you're around me, you're teasing or immature. You're describing 15-year-old Max. We're adults now, so can we start over? Okay. Good. Running buddies? Fine. Good. Ohhh!! Uh, sorry. Yeah. Let's, uh... Can we try that again? Oh, yeah. Yeah, um... Oh, your... your painting. Uh, you workin' on any showcases or something? No, um, I'm not showing right now. Uh, I mean... Why not? Because I'm not painting right now. Okay. I opened an art school a year ago and I'm focusing on that. Okay, well, uh, what about your dating life. What happened there? You were dating someone, and like... Actually, I forgot something at home. I'll run back. So, how's it been with Max? Hmm, fine. Fine? Oh no, that bad? Hmm. Worse? [grimaces] Ehh... Well, remember, you can have anything you want if you just... Please don't say vision board. Okay. But speaking of vision boards, I brought mine. Ava! I just don't want you to give up on your dreams. Okay, what if I'm not giving up on my dreams, what if my dreams are just... changing? And what if they're not? Why don't you just vision board to double check? Because I don't collage. Then paint. I asked myself what I really wanted. That I made a board, and I focused on it every day, and it came true. Guess who I'm about to meet with? Who? The curator of the Cherry Blossom Arts Festival. I could put in a good word for the emerging artist showcase. Thank you. I've mentioned you're relentless, right? Once or twice. [laughs] [claps] Well, Renee, it was so nice to meet you. And you, too. It's so nice to put a face to a name. Mmhmm. And thank you so much for expediting the permits. When we lost our venue, I didn't know what we were gonna do. Ah, my pleasure. I know what the festival means to this town, and the botanical gardens is going to be a gorgeous venue. And so convenient. The Herman Arts Foundation is just down the street. York and Seventh. Oh. That's a block away from my best friend's art school, Canvas Creations? Funny enough, the head of the Herman Arts Foundation was thinking about stopping in and asking about painting lessons. Well, actually... Does your friend not do painting lessons? Oh, no, no, no. She does, but speaking of my friend... - Oh, hi Michael. - I missed the meeting? Sorry. I'll fill you in. The permitting is taken care of, and everything is on schedule. Oh, and that art school down the street from us, the one that you were looking at for painting classes? The teacher sounds great. [knocking on door] Hey. Guess who has a private showing with the curator of the art festival? I'm hoping it's you? Renee's coming here on Thursday to review your work for the emerging artist showcase. Which would be great, except I have no work for her to review. What about the landscapes? I submitted all my best stuff last year. Wait, you're painting? Not exactly... Vision boarding? Show me. Now. [gasps] Jamie... It's beautiful. Well, I thought about what I wanted, and this just came to me. It's after I win the showcase, my first solo show in Paris. This is an exhibit of my art in a colonnade and this is the man I love bringing me a rose to congratulate me. In this moment, I have everything I've ever wanted. And although this may never happen, [laughs] I have to say thank you. I'm painting again. I'm happy for you. Now finish it so it can happen, because you are about to make all your dreams come true. One final signature. And congratulations. Thank you. Thank you! Should we celebrate? I, uh, saw a donut shop down the street. We could review our notes for our meeting with the contractors. Do you mind if we do it tomorrow? I know, I know, we have so much to do, but I have class later, and I wanna get some painting in. Ava got me a showing with the curator of the Cherry Blossoms Art Festival. That's wonderful, honey. So, you're painting again. [laughs] [knocking] Oh, hi. Hi. Um, am I too late to join the art class? Uh... Do you take drop-ins? Of course. 'Kay. Come on in. Thanks. Um... they're all... Extremely talented artists? Yes, that too. [sighs] I didn't realize this is a school for children. Sorry about the mix-up. Oh, don't be intimidated. It was everyone's first day, once. It's for kids. It's for the young at heart. Come on. So, today, we're learning about composition. - Okay. - Okay. [clears throat] I'm Jamie, by the way. Hi, I'm Michael. Lovely. And the light is coming from? Here. Very good. How am I doing? Well, we don't give grades here, but you're doing great. You really caught the light here, which is difficult. It's a little too controlled, a little too concerned with the outcome. You can see all that from this? Art is very revealing. Don't beat yourself up over it. I actually struggle with it in my work, too. So, what do you do to counteract it? Well, when I remember to, I try to let go of expectations of perfection. Mmhmm. And just relax and... ...let myself enjoy the creative process. So, what do you suggest I do? Take a new canvas, and this time, don't make, just... let yourself feel. Go on. Okay. I'll see you soon. Bye, Miss Jamie. Bye, Lizzie. Remember, composition! Bye. So. What did you think? I think the jury's out on my innate creativity, but uh, the upside is, I've got a lot of kindling, so... No, look, this is progress. Don't give up yet, it was just your first lesson. Yeah. I could definitely use another. Yeah, you might like the 13 to 15-year-old class better. [laughs] Or maybe a one-on-one. Um, do you offer private instruction? I do. Do you have availability Thursday, 5:00 PM? I do. That would be perfect. [laughs] [gasps excitedly] You have a date? It's a lesson. He's a student. It's professional. Oh! But he is really handsome. And he has an accent. Oh, maybe. Have you decided what you're going to show Renee tomorrow? No. I wanted to paint something new, but what are we doing here? Max is redoing our garden. Max. [clears throat] Does that mean he's meeting us here? Yeah. Why? Don't tell me you're gonna run away just to avoid him. I wouldn't phrase it like that, but... Hey, guys. Hmm? Thanks. Thank you. - You good? - Yeah. Uh, Renee and I will be by at 10:00 on Thursday. - Good luck painting. - Thank you, I need the good luck. You headed home? I can, um, walk you. Uh, you know, actually, I have to go to the Farmer's Market, so... That's perfect. I have to head there and pick up some basil, I'm making pesto for dinner. - Pesto? - Yeah. So, uh, did I hear Ava say that you were painting again? Yeah. I'm working on a submission for a showcase. Oh, that's awesome. I was actually getting kinda sad, thinking that you weren't going to make art anymore. I'm kind of a big fan. [scoffs] What? I remember when you were a kid, you'd be out in your yard for hours, just painting with whatever you could find. Chalk, sticks, dirt. Do you remember when you made that massive mud mural? That was awesome. Yeah, well, too bad you can't make a living off of sidewalk art, right? Yeah, Ava also told me your school's going well. Yeah. My dad and I are actually teaming up to open some new locations. Congrats, that's... that's awesome. Hold on. If you're running two locations, and working with kids, where's that going to leave time for painting? I'll paint on the side. Uh, Jamie, you are not a paint on the side-er, don't you think you should be focusing on your art? Oh, what, so now you're an expert on how I should live my life? [laughs] Well, hang on a second. Let me get a pen, I'll just take notes. Okay. First note, commit to your art. Really? You're giving me advice on how to commit? I could commit. [laughs] To what? Uh, to following my heart, even though half the time I have no clue where that takes me. Okay, according to Ava, over the past six years, it's taken you to over a dozen cities, jobs, and girlfriends. Uh, okay, I am trying to figure out what I want, okay? Maybe. Or maybe it's just you like "the new," "the chase," and then when something loses its novelty... [claps hands] Like I said. I'm figuring out what I want. I'm not as lucky as you. You've always known what you want... to paint. Well, as usual, Max, this has been... uh, interesting. Okay, wait. Let me guess. You forgot something at home, and now you have to run and get it. Bye, Max. See you at home. [upbeat inspirational music] ♪♪ [knocking at door] [sighs] Thank you. What time is it? Oh, time to wake up. Renee is gonna be here in less than an hour. Have you decided what you're gonna show... Oh, Jamie, it's beautiful. Renee is gonna love it. Um... I'm not showing her that. Then why were you up all night painting it? Because, I felt... inspired. But I'm not showing Renee a vision board. We'll just, uh, display some of my old landscapes I haven't submitted before. I'll go clean up. [sighs] Hmm. So, Jamie. Yes. When did you start painting? When I was in high school. Well, actually, I guess I've always been painting, in some form or another. I mean, when I was a kid I used to sit and make art with anything I could find, but I started seriously painting when I was 15, and then art school, and got an MFA. Well. You are incredibly talented, and there are so many successful elements here. But... I'm just not feeling the emotion. Some of your work feels as if it's forced, almost as if you're playing it safe. Do you have anything else that maybe I could take a look at? Not at this time. Well then, I thank you for sharing. It has truly been a privilege... Actually, she does. No, I don't. She does. You do. I don't. She does. It's beautiful. It's from Jamie's new series about... dreams. Well then, I would love to see it. Right this way. I love it. It's heartfelt, and bold, and it takes a chance. [gasps] Do you think you can get it to me in time for the art festival? Yes! So I'm in the showcase? Mmhmm. This is in the showcase? Congratulations. Thank you. Vision. Board. [gasps excitedly] Hey. Woah, you've been busy. Uh, just some potential plans, how we could use the space, a list of contractors and vendors, and the start of an operations manual for hiring and best practices. I've also emailed it to you. Dad. You've done so much! Eh, I'm excited, and I've got the time, and I know you got a lot on your plate. Well, it's just until I turn in this painting, and then I promise, you will have my undivided attention. Okay, honey. I almost forgot the most important part. What's that? [together] Donuts! Don't get enough of me at home. [gasps] Ulgh! Sorry. How's work going? A walk in the park. It's only my fourth day so we'll see. Four days. Wow, that's a commitment for you. Can I take a look? Sure. It's beautiful. Well, it's easy to make something beautiful when all this is your subject. You're modest, but you're right. Cherry blossom season is the best time of the year. When I was homesick, this is pretty much what I thought of. Yeah, they're pretty perfect. Their form, their colour, their composition. You know what's funny, I never really thought of them like that. Well, what do you think about? How they make me feel? And how is that? Like perfection does exist, although fleeting, like life. It's all the more precious for its uncertainty. Ava told me that you got accepted into that showcase. Ah, with her help, yes. And first prize is a solo show in Paris, your dream. Surprised you remember that. Really? We've known each other for 24 years, you'd think you mentioned Paris once or twice or a thousand times. Yeah, it's an artist's cliche. A show in Paris. Who cares if it's cliche. You know for once I think I can get behind your cavalier attitude. Did I just make you smile? No, I smiled on my own. Oh, okay. Thank you. I should get going. Thank you for the walk. You're welcome. Come back. Oh, bring your students. That's a good idea. Yeah, I know. I'm full of them. [rings bell] Hey. Hi. You ready? Yes. I chose bottles because painting glass is tricky, especially in this light. So it forces us to stop and really look. You know? And then upon studying it, you realize it's... it's so much more than just glass and a bottle. Highlights, lowlights, shade, tone? How do you know that? I love art. Uh-huh. I painted when I was young. I actually had delusions of being a professional artist. - Ah! - Yeah. Well, in the art world, we call delusions "dreams". Hmm. Uh, so what happened? I wanted a career path with a bit more stability. Mm. But also I found it too hard to put my work out there, to put myself out there in that way. Mm, I know what you mean. Plus, I hate getting messy. Ah, well, that may be hard to avoid, because art is... messy. [laughs awkwardly] I have an idea. Baby steps putting yourself out there. Canvas Creations is having our spring show. Maybe you could display something. I'll give it some thought. What about you? What's your work like, you know, what do you paint? Whoo, not really sure how to answer that. Well, I took a year away from painting, and now I'm back with something different, it looks different, it feels different. So, will you show me this magical painting of yours? Yeah. I'd love to... When it's done. That means I get to see you again. I'd like that. So, how was your date? It wasn't a date, it was a lesson. But, I think we might see each other again. Like, as a date, or a lesson? [laughs] I'm not sure, just as it seemed like he was gonna ask me out, he got a phone call and had to leave. Oh, and how's the Canvas Creations expansion? Honestly, I feel like I'm not really pulling my weight, with all the painting I'm doing for the showcase. And what happens if you win the showcase? Are you really gonna want to stop working on your solo show in Paris to do marketing? I don't know. Think about it. [upbeat music] ♪♪ Well, aren't I full of good ideas? [scoffs] Don't make me remind you of all the bad ideas you've had over the years. Let's see. "Golf cart in a lake" ring a bell? [laughs] That was a good one. You know what, let's focus on the present. Mmhmm. I got another good idea. When you're done here, come meet me at the rose garden, I'll come give you a special behind the scenes tour. Oh, thank you, but I'm busy. I can't hear you. And I'll see you later. I... [scoffs] So, uh, this is our next project. Wow. Yeah, we, uh, just finished the design and then we go into the planting process. Well, do you think you'll stick around long enough to see it finished? I don't know. But, I bet you're eager to have a new neighbour, so... Actually, I was kinda learning to enjoy having you as a neighbour. Oh thanks, Jamie. I wish it didn't need the "actually", or "kind of", or "learning to," but besides that, yeah, I think that is the nicest thing you've ever said to me. You're welcome. Oh, we're, uh, interviewing for the landscape architect position. I'm confused. You have a Master's in landscape architecture. I do. So you're a landscape architect. Yeah, I am. So, why don't you apply for the position? No, no, no. Way too much responsibility. Ahh. It's all managing, and coordinating, and bureaucracy, and as the groundskeeper, I just get to play in the dirt all day. - Of course. - Of course. And you know, who knows how long I wanna be around. There's no way I'm getting tied down with these obligations and responsibilities. You mean "life?" No, that's not life. Life is passion and fun and travelling, and... Life should be an adventure. Me personally, I don't want to have any regrets. But never committing to anything has regrets of its own. Now who's the expert on someone else's life? You're exasperating. Yet, you are smiling. [clicks pen] Let's go. Ava said that your vision board was going well. Oh, she did, did she? Yeah. What else did she say? She mentioned something about a shadowy dream man. Oh, it was in passing, but... This dream man, who is he? I don't know. What do you think he's like? Well, he's perfect. Sounds like me. He's also too humble to know he's perfect. Also sounds like me. Okay. He's... kind, and passionate, charitable, intelligent, well, he loves art, and of course he's very handsome. Of course. But, how does he make you feel? 'Cause there's tons of intelligent, smart, articulate men out there, me for example, but what matters is how he makes you feel. Hmm. I'll give it some thought. Right now, I have to go. - Hi. - Hi. I'm sorry I had to run off yesterday, and we didn't get to finish our conversation about seeing each other again. For another lesson. I was thinking more like a date. [flustered] Ah. Sure. Okay. Uh, tomorrow night? Great. Perfect. Okay... I walked out without giving this to you... But, uh, I, uh, saw it in a florist, and it made me think of you. It's breathtaking. See you tomorrow night? Yes. The vision board man is Michael. It's like he just stepped out of my painting. This is weird. I mean, there has to be a logical explanation for it. Sometimes in life, there are no logical explanations. Like with love. [phone vibrates] [laughs] Is that Michael? No, it's Max. Max who? Max, your brother? Excuse me, my brother is texting you, and you're smiling. But you're not just like, "smiling" you are smiling. I'm not smiling like anything. I'm definitely not smiling like that. Nobody is smiling like that. Ava, you asked us to get along, so we're getting along. That's it. Fine. Surprises, surprises. You actually showed up. I did. But I can only stay for a little. I'm meeting my dad in an hour. Okay. Okay. Setting up for the Cherry Blossom Art Festival. Yeah. Oh. Ta-da. Seriously? Hey, you still remember how to drive this thing? I think? All right, yeah, you put one foot in front of the other, and you pedal. [laughs sarcastically] Let's go. Yeah. Why don't you take that one and we race? How's that sound? [laughs] Is it weird that we're doing this? Why would it be weird? 'Cause, this is like total dating activity, and we are not dating. Oh, no, not a date, just, uh, two friends cycling. Uh-huh. Since you brought it up, uh, what's going on with your dating life? I thought for sure you were going to end up marrying your ex, whatever his name was. Ha, I also thought I would marry whatever his name was. So, what happened? Uh, he said he thought we'd lost our spark. Ahh. And if he stayed with me, he'd feel like he was making the safe choice. [sighs] Ouch. Yeah. Ouch. What did you think? Well, I was heartbroken, and I thought for sure he was wrong. I mean, relationships are more than a spark, they're history and compatibility. Sharing lives. But now I'm starting to see he was right, we would've been settling. The breakup was really hard. It made me question everything. I mean, I... I was so sure my life would turn out this one way, and then suddenly I was 29, single, my art wasn't panning out the way I thought it would, and I realized I couldn't keep living a dream. So you opened Canvas Creations? Yeah. It was sort of a plan B that's become a plan A. [uncomfortable sigh] What about you? You dating anyone? Hmm, no. Not yet. Well, this has actually been fun. Oh. I just wish it didn't need the "actually," again. [sighs] I should get going. But there's something we should do first. Remember we always used to do this after bike rides? It brings back good memories. It does. I do remember the last time I was at the bikes. Okay. It was that spring when you pulled the secret admirer prank on me. Your last letter said "my secret admirer" would meet me at the bike rentals and reveal himself. I was so excited, I told all my friends, and I waited for hours, and he never came. I'm sorry, Jamie. I... I was... Max, it's okay. We were kids. You know, the funny thing is, I actually really liked my secret admirer. [laughs] I felt like he liked me too, despite how mad I was at you for that, I actually kept the letters, and I know it's because, I don't know, they meant so much to me. Where'd you get that material, anyway? I wrote it. No, really. Come on. Really, I wrote it. Well, how'd you come up with it? I thought of you. Uh, thought of the look on your face when you would fall for the joke. Yeah, that one. [laughs sarcastically] Bye, Max. [sighs] Hey, Renee. It's Jamie. I wanted to let you know I'll be turning in my painting tomorrow. [knocking at door] - Hello. - Hi. Oh, come in, I'm just need to grab my bag. Sure. Wow, it's a lovely place. Thanks. Shall we? Yes. [small laugh] ♪ I thought we'd check out this music in the parks event. Yeah. You okay? What's going on? Oh, yeah. Just a funny coincidence. Oh, I didn't know they had live music here. Mm. It's a new monthly arts and culture series. Different sponsors bring in musicians and artists. I'm thinking of hosting a painting exhibit here this summer. You're going to host it? I might've buried the lead a bit, but I actually head up an arts foundation. Really? The Herman Arts Foundation. The Herman Arts Foundation? That sponsors the Cherry Blossom Art Festival? Yes, yeah. The painting I told you I was finishing is for the emerging artist showcase. Really? Well, what a small world. Yeah. Is there something wrong? Well, I guess I'm just wondering if this... is a conflict of interest? Oh no, no. It's... it's a happy coincidence. I don't judge the showcase, I have no effect on the outcome. Ah. I mean, I'll be at the judging to represent the foundation, but I have no sway on who wins. I see. So you'll be at the judging. Of course. What's wrong? Nothing. Nothing is wrong. [exhales] You are never going to believe what happened. What... what's wrong? How was the date? Better question is "who" is the date. Michael is actually Michael Herman. From the Herman Arts Foundation. No way. Yes, way. [gasps] When I told Renee about Canvas Creations, she mentioned the head of the foundation was interested, but I didn't realize that that was Michael. Ha! - How funny. - No, not funny. Why? Who cares? So you went on a date. He's not a judge, right? No, he... he's not a judge. - And I won't be a contestant. - Why not? Because I can't display a painting of a shadowy man giving me the exact rose Michael gave me standing in front of the colonnade exactly like the one he took me on a date in front of the art exhibition exactly like the one he plans on hosting this summer. Oh yeah, that's bad. Yeah. What am I gonna do? My painting is due in five days, and I have nothing. No, you have something. What? You have five days. Great. I know I said I would deliver it today, but I need a few more days. Jamie, I need your painting in four days. Will you have it finished? Definitely. I have already made waves accepting your unfinished submission. Otherwise, I will have to give your spot to someone else. I understand. Okay. Thank you. [power drill] Hi, honey. I thought we didn't start construction till next week. The contractor had a cancellation, so he could begin earlier. Oh, that's right. Dad texted me about that. Hey, where's Dad? Oh, he's been here with the workers since 7:00 AM. So, he just went to get them lunch. That is so sweet. Ugh, I feel bad. I mean, I should be the one here at 7:00 AM, I should be the one getting them lunch. It's okay, honey. He knows that this is a hectic time for you. So, I have been waiting. Tell me all about Michael. He's great. He's... smart, cultured, very handsome. Hmm! I mean, he is literally my vision board come to life. Somehow. I don't know, there's something missing. When I first met him, I got like, fluttery. And I didn't have that last night. I know, there's not always an immediate connection, so we're going out again. He's going to take me to an art show opening. So, I think it just takes time. Jamie? Hmm? You shouldn't have to convince yourself. [knocking at door] Who is it? Uh, it's me. Come in. - Hi. - Hi. I just made a bunch of cookies, and I figured I'd better get them out of my apartment before I eat them all and I thought of you. Ah, well, that is very... sweet. [laughs] Is this your painting for the showcase? Yeah. Can I see it? Um... It's very... minimalist. Mm. Okay, what happened? I thought you were almost done this. Well, long story short, be careful what you wish for. My last painting went... awry, and instead of taking it as a sign I should give up on art, I've never wanted to paint more. That's great. No, but I have a blank canvas. Well, what would you tell one of your students? I would tell them... not to focus on making, but on feeling. I would tell them to have fun. I would tell them be playful. Yeah. That was playful, no? You didn't. I did. [laughs] Oh. Oh, okay. Hmm. Ooh. [laughs] All right. - Yeah. - Yeah. I dare you. Oh, it's comin'. - Go for it. - It's comin'. - It's coming! - Go for it! Ohh, oh... [laughs] Nice try. I should get back to work. Okay. But thank you for the cookies. No problem. I like this. Gorgeous. Hi. After you. Thank you. Thank you, thanks. - Cheers. - Cheers. Oh, there's some curators I want you to show your work too. Oh, I don't think I'm ready for that. Of course you are. I have no doubt you'll stun them with your talent. Well, that's very sweet, but first I actually have to have something to show them. What about your showcase submission? I thought you were almost finished. There was a... hiccup? That hiccup sounds stressful. It is, it's a stressful time. I had to start over on my painting while also teaching, and working with my dad to open another Canvas Creations. We're looking to franchise, so it's... That's incredible. You think? Of course. It'll be a steady source of income that gives you security. Yeah, that's true. But I mean, the expansion means I won't have any time to paint. Now, maybe, but it's a short-term sacrifice for a long-term gain. And you can paint on the side, right? Yeah, but I'm a painter, not a paint on the side-er. Yes, but... Art as a living, it's an uncertain future, as you know. I'm not saying you should give up on painting, but I know how difficult the art world is, and it's good to have a backup plan. Should we see the work? Mmhmm. [whispered] Hi. Well, thank you for bringing me. Thank you for coming. Michael, I think you're wonderful, and I've really enjoyed our time together, but... But... You're using the past tense. I mean, we have so much in common, it seems like we'd be perfect, and yet somehow, I just don't think we're the right match. But I'd still love to teach you, if that's something you want. I'll... give it some thought. Okay. You never stop. Well, there is a special magic to night gardening. The flowering plants come out, the jasmine. I'm glad I caught you. I have something for you. Come on. Wait here one second. Okay. For your inspiration. And if, uh, that doesn't work, my microbrew. [laughs] Thank you. No problem. It's very sweet. Thanks. Goodnight, Jamie. Goodnight, Max. [laughs] [phone rings] Hey, Dad. Hi, honey. Just wondering if you're on your way. We were supposed to pick out paint today... I'm actually already back at the studio. Dad, I am so sorry. My piece is due in three days, and I was up all night working on it, I... [sighs] I completely forgot we were meeting. That's... that's okay, we can pick out paint some other day. But Jamie... Good luck with your piece. Thank you. Okay... I come bearing cake! Ah, thank you so much for picking it up. Oh, you're welcome. Cute! Hey, you have not texted me back since your date with Michael, are you hiding something? Well, actually... Hi. Hey, guys. Hey. Hi. Oh, thank you for picking up the extra cupcakes. No problem. [laughs] So, what do you think? Hi. Your daughter is so talented. Miss Jamie! Yes. Hi. I finished in time. [gasps] I knew you could do it. I'm so proud of you! Thank you so much. Of course. So. What do you think? [exhales] Well, I think it's safe to say this is an occasion where you can say even a kid could've done this one. Ha ha. Kidding. It's great. They're lucky to have you as a teacher. Well, vice versa. Excuse me. Is that Michael? Yeah, I didn't know he was coming. Hi. Wow. Well, I'm glad you decided to show your work. I decided it's good to put myself out there. Even if I don't get the reception I hoped for. Jamie, I won't try to pretend. I like you. I was hoping we'd have a future, but I know that, like with painting, what matters is how it feels. Who is that? That's Jamie's dream man. Wait, wait, who... who is that? His name is Michael, he runs the arts festival. Jamie's dating him. What? I'm sorry, Max. I didn't want you to get hurt. Why would I get hurt? Come on, you have a thing for Jamie. You always had a thing for Jamie. A thing? Well, what is the right word for 15 years of unspoken feelings? Max, maybe it's time to speak those feelings. Because we saw you and Jamie before, and it looks like she feels it too. Yeah, I gotta go. Baby steps. Hey, uh... You hungry? I made dinner. I could eat. Wow, your apartment is so... nice. I'll try not to be offended by how surprised you sound. Woah. I thought that you shouldn't have to wait till your show in Paris to eat French Food. [scoffs] Well, I have no idea how I'll possibly win that show, but thank you. You know how to stir? Ah, stirring is about the limit of my culinary talents. Well, at least you have that. Uh-huh. Mmhmm. I didn't know you cooked. Yeah, you know. I dabble. Tonight I made a Parisian dish called Pommes Aligot. [impressed] Oh. It's just a fancy way of saying "mashed potatoes with fondue on it". [chuckles] So, the French birth Cezanne and Monet, and now their greatest masterpiece, cheesy potatoes. What about their true masterpiece? Monet's water lilies? No, French Fries. Of course! Oh. [laughs] So, um, I saw you at the art exhibit talking to... Mm. Michael. Right. What's going on between you two? Well, um, I was teaching him to paint, and we went on a date, and then I ended things. Why? You know, I'm not sure, exactly. But things are over between you now? Yeah. [exhales] Okay, um. Glad to hear that. I have something to tell you. Okay... Remember that whole year I pretended to be your secret admirer? Mmhmm. I wasn't pretending. It wasn't a joke. Everything that I wrote was true. That's how I felt. I was gonna tell you that day at the bikes, I was there, but when I saw you, I just, I... I chickened out. And now I'm here, trying to find the courage to tell you that 15 years later, I'm still an admirer. But I don't want it to be a secret anymore. Jamie, I have feelings for you. [flustered] Ooh. Well, um... Thank you for telling me. I... I mean I really don't know what to say, I... spending time with you has been great, but Max, I worry that next week, you'll be interested in someplace else, something else, someone else. I mean, I know you. Don't... no. [sighs] You think you know me, but this? This is who I am. Someone who wants to be with you, someone who always has. Woah. Can I think about it? These cheesy potatoes are not gonna eat themselves. Bon Appetit? [spoons clink] [Upbeat inspirational music] ♪ So, uh, Sundance or Golden Light? Uh, well, they're both great. You decide. I've never known you to be laissez-faire about paint. Dad, they're both good options. You don't like either? I think I have some samples in the back. I finished my painting. That's wonderful. And as soon as I did, I felt like I wanna start another one. And that made me realize I want to be painting, and on my breaks from painting, teaching. I don't want to be running a big business, I don't want to be hiring, or marketing. So, tell your dad. But he's so excited. I mean, I haven't seen him this happy in years. Plus, we have sunk so much time and money into this place, it just, it, I mean, it feels wrong to consider pulling away, but... it feels worse to keep going knowing every minute I'd be here, I would want to be painting. I found the samples. Great. Oh, Jamie. Please tell me you have some good news. Yes. I finished this morning. Full disclosure, it's not the painting you approved, but... Renee, I think it is so much better. Here's a picture. Oh. Oh! And you'll have this delivered to me by tonight? Yes, tonight. Excuse me. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thanks. [gasps] Why are you avoiding me? I'm not avoiding you. Yes you are since your date with Michael. What happened? Did you elope? Uh, no. The date was fine, Michael likes me, he expressed he'd hoped we'd have a future. Why do I feel like I should hold the confetti? Because I ended it? What? Why? Because I'm falling for Max. Oh, Jamie. You know I love Max, but you know how Max is, he can't commit to anything. I know. Michael seemed so perfect and he was talking about a future? Again, I know. It makes no sense. You painted that whole vision board about Michael, I mean that has to mean something. I think it means that in painting what I thought I want, I realized what I need. I just don't want you or Max to get hurt. I don't either. Oof, I have to go. Uh, dinner tonight? Oh, yeah. Tom and I are going to Patricio's for pizza with Max. I guess we can double date now. Okay, bye. Bye. Oh, perfect. Yes. Thank you. Hi. Hi. Jamie just left. Really? Oh. Sad I missed her. I bet you are. I bet I am. She told me something's been going on between the two of you. What did she say? Look, Max, you know I love you, and I think you're all these amazing things, but I don't want you to sweep Jamie off her feet into some whirlwind romance, and then two months from now, just up and leave her. I would never do that. Are you sure? Because you don't have the best track record. Yeah, I know, but... You never thought you could have her, so you didn't have to take your feelings seriously to actually commit. And Jamie deserves someone who can commit, and she was just dating someone who wanted to, and she broke it off with him to be with you. Just, don't hurt her. Hey, neighbour. Hey. Are you free? I want to show you my painting before I turn it in. Actually, uh, I'm not. I have something to do with work. Oh, work? Yeah. [laughs] Okay, Max, what's going on? Jamie, I... I think you should be with Michael. Are you... joking? No. Look, we both know that you deserve someone who can give you everything. Someone who can commit. Okay, well I didn't ask you, or anyone, to commit. But it's really good to know you still can't. [laughs] I mean Max, you pursued me. You told me that you had feelings for me, you always have, and now I have feelings for you, and you're pulling away? Why, because you're so scared of anything even remotely resembling commitment? No, 'cause I want you to be happy. No, that is not why. It's because this is who you are. You get so excited about something or someone, and then the second it stops being fun and starts being real, you just get scared. And run away. You talk a big game about following your heart, and living with no regret, and the truth is, that is either all talk, or when it comes to us, there is just no heart, and no regret. So I guess it's true then. Every time I'm around you I get hurt and humiliated. [sighs] [sighs] [phone notification] "Hi Jamie. It's Renee. "I needed your piece last night, and so I have no option "but to replace your painting. "I'm sorry". [exhales] Honey, we've been trying to call you. Jamie, what's going on? What's going on is I lost my place in the showcase, and I am not gonna win the show in Paris, and I have no idea what my future as a professional artist looks like, but even with all of that, I still don't want to give up on painting. Dad, I'm sorry. I know this entire expansion was my idea, and you're trying to help, but I just want to paint, and then teach when I can. I know you do. Glad you realized it, too. Wait, you knew? Well then, why didn't you tell me? You had to figure it out on your own. I'm just glad you did it now, and not 20 years from now. I'm sorry. Don't be sorry, even doing just this was fun, it gave me a reason to get out of bed in the morning. You mean other than your wife? And daughter. [chuckles] I'll find something else to do. You know, Dad, you want me to be happy, and I want you to be happy too. Do you love this? If I helped get it running, and consulted as an artist in residence, could you continue without me and run the business? Is that something you'd want to do? Definitely. Then yes. I mean, it... it'll be hard without you... Oh, yeah. But I'll be happy knowing you're doing exactly what you should be doing. Oh. But Jamie, how did you lose your spot in the showcase? Oh, I messed up my painting. And you can't fix it? No. But, maybe I could start over.

I have just poured my heart into this, and I was... I was just hoping you could... [sighs with relief] Oh, thank you. Oh... I can't put this in the showcase. It wouldn't be fair. I understand. But we can still show this. You can? How? You'll see. Leave it to me. Where have you been? I've called a hundred times. I know, I'm sorry. Long story short, right after I told you about Max, he in typical Max fashion, lost interest and broke it off, and he said he thought I'd be better dating Michael. - Oh no. - Oh yes. No, that's not what happened. I gave Max a talking to, and I might've been a little harsh, and said that Michael was what was best for you. What? I'm sorry, I had good intentions. So... Max backed off because he wanted what was best for me? And he thought that was Michael? Yeah. Ava, look. I know Max and I do not make sense. But when I'm with him, I feel like I do when I'm painting, you know like, like it's where I should be. It's all I've ever wanted for you. Thank you. But maybe next time just like, a little less meddling. Deal. [giggles] Besides, you would make the best sister in law. Oh! Or aunt. [whispers excitedly] You're pregnant! It's still early. [laughs] Congratulations! I'm so happy for you. I have a million questions, I want to hear everything. But right now... You have to go find Max. Yes. Is he here? Yeah, he's at the gardens, but... Okay. Hi, gotta go. Okay, bye. All right everyone, if I could have your attention please. We are about to announce our winner of the emerging artist showcase. If I could have my judges step on stage with me, please. Max! Max! I have to talk to you. Uh, can it wait a minute? I'm sorry, no. It can't. I'm so sorry, I'm just in the middle of a job interview. Not an interview. You know the job's yours if you want it. The landscape architect position? You're staying? Gimme a minute? Mmmhmmm. Yes. Someone wise, who apparently knows how I should be living my life more than I do, told me that not committing comes with regrets of its own. And you were right, I would regret giving up. I would regret running when I was scared, I would regret not giving myself a chance to see who I could really be. Most of all, I would regret not doing everything I can to be with you. ♪ Hold that thought. My painting's being displayed, and I really want to show you. Jamie. Go. Renee. After the art festival, I want you to find me, so I can talk about a group show. Wha... [gasps] It's beautiful. Now, aren't you glad you took my advice and committed? You know, you are still exasperating. You're still smiling. [laughs]
