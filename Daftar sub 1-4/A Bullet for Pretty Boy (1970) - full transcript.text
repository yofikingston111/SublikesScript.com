[tires squealing] Maybe we better go after him. We do as we're told. We get to a phone and tell 'em we think we made contact with Floyd. [branch creaking] [car approaching] [tires skidding] You're gonna have to get out of here, right now. Why, what is it? The Feds. They're comin' down the road, stoppin' and searchin' every building they get to, and they'll be here pretty soon. What's your truck worth? 200, for real. Here's four. Thanks for the warning. I'm grateful. Then do something for me. Can you hide Betty? There's a place back in the hills where she'll be safe. You've got to be kidding! I can't stay here, I won't! Look, you've got the truck, come on, let's go like we planned. Betty. We'll never make it. Take this. When they're gone, use it to get north. Forget it. I stick with you. It's no good anymore. Besides, you won't like where I'm going. Meaning what? Meaning I'm going back home. Oh, but you're crazy. The place is crawling with cops by now. There's cops everywhere. Listen, I don't just blow away like yesterday's paper. I'm going home. It's over. You simple-minded fool, you're still a hick! You go back to your lousy farmers, and I hope they find you and they kill you! What about you, partner? It's my home too. [engine clanking] [tires skidding, gunshots] This ought to do until night. What then? Run a block, I guess. Better sleep 'til dark. Won't have much chance after. No, you go ahead. Being asleep gives me bad dreams. I'll just stay up with my sick friend here. If we've got any shooting to do, that ain't gonna help your aim any. [engine clanking] Spotted him again down by Ralston. Let's wait for the Feds on up the road. If that's him, I don't want to be this close when he wakes up. Earl... We've got a chance to take Pretty Boy Floyd all by ourselves. Well, we'd be in every newspaper in the country. I don't want to be in any newspaper. If you want your job, follow me. [moaning] [gunshots, Preacher groaning] ♪♪ [glass shatters] What's the trouble? Car-carburetor, I think. Try it now. [engine turning] You scared? Don't be. All I want is a ride. You sure? Yeah, I'm sure. I told the sheriff we should have waited for you. If we had, it'd all be over now. It'll be over, soon enough. [driver] Mr. Floyd, would you mind doing me a real, great favor? Well, you know I'm gonna be telling everybody all about this. Well, unless I can prove it, I think they'll just laugh at me, say I'd been out in the sun too long, or something. What I'm wondering is, would you mind signing something for me? Stop this thing. You gonna run that block? Get out of here. Get out of here! [gunshots] [tires skidding] [splashing] [gunshots] [screaming] [gasping] You're not gonna make it.
