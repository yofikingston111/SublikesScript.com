Our meeting is at 9. It is now exactly 9. A Bullet in the Gun Barrel (1958) What is he up to? So? I told you already, we bought the nightclub so we wouldn't spend the 25 million. Not a chance. You're lying. You thought you'd never see me again Tony. You thought I was dead. Disappeared. Evaporated. And with your friend you spent my money. You're both swindlers! Finally I've found you. You have three days to pay me back. After the three, I'll have to take action. Sell your nice car, your nightclub, sell everything. I said three days. I don't like this. - There he is. How'd it go? - Bad. He wants his money in three days. Where will we get it? - He doesn't care. He only wants his money. And if he doesn't get it? - I fear we may have problems. Chang know Maltese for years, talk to him, make remember. What's the risk? He won't have him raw for dinner! Chang return in hour at Tip-Tap, bring good news. We've got a visitor, boss. Chang the Chink. How's business? As usual. 7 tables, a bottle there, 2 had a 2nd round, good table...3 there. A bumpkin spending big. He's perfect. 2 guys at the bar bothering Colette. Been there an hour, claim to be friends, drinking on your tab... I got this. Your friends became impatient Mr. Dick. They've been waiting over an hour. My friends? - Your friends, that's us! Are you the boss? One of them. You're big enough for decisions. We're in a hurry. Nice joint, seems you do well, all you're missing is protection. Of course. What did they drink? - Three whiskys each. On the house tab. For the tip it seems they pay in gentle caresses. It'll be 200 a week, no need to travel, just leave it with this cutie. That way nothing ever happens here. I assure you something happens tonight. Get the gentlemen's hats! By the way, Brigitte called twice, she'll call back. She's not coming? - Sure, just later as she's out with friends. Say, maybe it's time we look at the books? - Alright. Why won't you drink with Paulie? You look too young to work here... I'll join you. Want to come to my farm? 60 hectares, 800 hens... You'd be with other chicks, ha ha chicks... What gives? - Hands are forbidden, bill for table 8. Yes sir. - After that, you may bring him home. We can't go on like this. Losing 50 000 a day. - We're sinking. What should we do? We're not cut out for all this! Not made to run a nightclub, and enter complicated stories. We need to sell out quick, repay the Maltese. - And afterwards? After? We start over from zero. Let's go see Alberto now! - Let's go! That could be Chang. Brigitte. Yes? Hold on. Hello? Yes, it's me. I have to go out for an hour. Wait for me at the bar. Tell Chang to wait for us, and Brigitte too. It's the night watchman, chief. On the 12:30 patrol with Robert and we came across a body. Looks Chinese. Yes sir, a body as in a dead one. Tell the two who'll ask for me I've been gone for a half-hour. Pour two Scotches and ask Alberto to come over. Mr. Alberto left 30 min. ago. I said two Scotches and Alberto! Quick! If only I knew where he was! If only...uh...we're closing! Well then we'll help you! Run away! Strange Alberto can't hear this. - Don't worry, he'll hear this! What's all this noise? We wanted to see you right away, but your barman said you'd left. You know we're sensitive, the very thought a friend wouldn't see us... We got upset. My orders didn't include these gents, remember for the future. So what do you want, exactly? To remind you when you sold us the Tip-Tap, said you'd buy it back, same price, any time. You even swore it. - I never said that. Try to remember. You wore a bottle-green suit, matching tie, cream silk shirt and croco shoes. Remember it was at the bar of the Tip-Top, we even drank Aix from your personal bottle. I still have the coat, the tie and the shoes, Aix is my brand... But the words you heard me say, frankly, I don't remember. Then we must be inventing this, say it then, we're lying! If both of you say I said it, I may have. - Yeah, maybe. Suppose I did? Such things are said in deals! Business wordings, you know? Business wordings... I'll buy two whiskys on ice with a seltzer bottle for starters. Good evening Brigitte. Good evening Colette. Is Tony here? - I'm sure he won't be long. That's a lovely dress. - Thanks! Think Tony will like it? And Dick? Where's he? I'm warning you, anything happens to me, 3 witnesses know I'll get money in no time. Understood? For our little agreement, nothing's changed. Be on time. That piece of shit! Leopold? - Yes sir. - Tell Tony to come. Immediately. Tony? Dick needs you. What is it? - Chang. He called? He'll never call again. Damn. Know what else he dared tell me? 3 witnesses will swear we argued with Chang 10 minutes before he bought it! What do you say to that? - Incredible! That scum's fake witnesses even exist? 'Cause nothing else stops us from taking him out! Know what else? Screw him! A man asking for you. - We're not here. What gentleman? - P?p?re. But... - Allow me. So, kiddies, things not good? Getting hot under the collar? I know who you guys are. I respect your military pedigree, But at my age, rough ways don't please me. I'll get to the point. Your party at Caulaincourt St., and this! Not even done in the Far West anymore! Caulaincourt with Alberto is our business. - Oh really? Maybe my business a tiny bit also. The joint you busted up was mine. Mine! P?p?re! You kids new in town? Anyone knows Alberto is just a front. He's worked for me for 10 years! I thought you knew this. So the Tip-Tap we bought from Alberto was also yours? Of course, and I came to tell you you weren't scammed! Joint's worth 25 easy. - Some deal, we're losing 50K a day. What's this? You started three months ago! Business counts over a year. It's a good business. I had less at your age. Alberto was wrong to promise a buy-back, But you'd be twice as wrong to sell! Believe me. You have to wait for a ship to come in! I'll let my bar's damage slide, but don't try that again. Something I don't understand... Why do you need the money now? Not betting on horse races I hope. Should we tell him? - Maybe better we did. Tell me this story. In Saigon, before we were coming back. We met a guy... - A crook, yes?... He asked us to bring 25 mil to France, plus 2 for our commission. We blew our 2 million. - We get here and he doesn't show up! Worst of all, we bought the Tip-Tap so we wouldn't spend the Maltese's money. The Maltese? - Yeah. What's he look like? Tall-ish, shaved round head... - His mug is all pockmarked... He's returned? - Why? You know him? You're messing with a pretty bad sort. He's capable of anything. Maybe more than you'd think. He's framing us for murdering Chang, a friend. A Chinese guy he killed just now. - That's every bit his style. I should get you out of this mess. Put away the arsenal, we'll have a drink. That's how P?p?re operates. Don't worry your heads kids, I always think of something! I must speak to a friend, I'll join you. If we're playing tomorrow, we should leave. I'll ask a few more minutes, I need to talk to that man. Who is he? Only the best for your buddy, where does he find them? Sure, she's not bad. - What's her story? Some rich guy's kid. - I prefer that! Dating the Sisters is the worst vice... Make the error of buying 'em shoes, then suddenly bag, gloves, hat and suit don't match! Here's to the end of your worries. - I wouldn't mind. I won't want any, I must bring Brigitte home. - I understand completely. If she has an older sister, I'm in. Even with her mom I'll bet I'd do OK. No such luck, she only has her father. - I won't go that far! Problems don't seem to slow him down. He'd have come, but they play golf tomorrow. Seriously? - Yes! She's a champion and teaching him! What do you do then? - I hold auditions. We need a hot draw, to discover a Piaf! Ah heck, one must keep up appearances... You're right there kid, we must always keep up appearances. If I get an idea during the night, you'll be here tomorrow morning? Of course. I've auditions starting at 11. My respects ma'am, and apologies for staying so late. Should I see you home? - I know the way. Who's that? - A friend. Alright, let's close up. Just as I thought... If you come to my dance, if you take my hand You'll bring me luck, we'll go very far The two of us, come and dance come and dance... You don't even know, your own prodigious power You make one word of "I love you" the word of good God Of good God come and dance come and dance... Erase this dreary d?cor and this sadly crying trombone Become for me the illusionist Removing this sad ball I love it, you start tonight. - Thank you. Next! - My turn! What this? - My new strip. I'm a cleaning lady! Wait a sec. Your name on the list? - Am?lie the "Bonne" (cleaning lady/good) Hello! - Will this take long? It's auditions. - Turn these people out, I have something to show you. Fed up with the arts, send 'em all home. - That's all for today. I'm sure you'll be interested. Six months' work went into this, with an expert in surveillance! Go ahead, sit down. That's Brigitte! - Sure, but the man is even more interesting. You'll see. Watch closely Dick, it gets even more interesting. You understood? - Brigitte's cheating with an old guy? Well, you caught nothing. Firstly, he's not that old... And let's get serious, please. Mr. Geoffrain is the girl's father. He looks distinguished. Don't judge by looks. The worldly man is king gold smuggler in Belgium and Switzerland. In each suitcase you saw, there's never less than 100 mil in metal. In broad daylight, in his own town, his personal plane picks up for delivery. Those days, dropping girlie off at golf is Mr. Geoffrain's alibi. Only we never know when it will happen. Getting there yet? - I don't see it. You need money to calm the Maltese. So... - So what? Mornings Tony and girl go hit their little ball, things are for the best. The day she prefers her daddy, and cancels Tony for playtime... That day we'll have 100 million within reach. Believe me Dick, taking from this scammer is almost a public service. I came by taxi, can you drive me home? Naturally, don't tell Tony the whole story. No need to know it's his girlie's father. He seems the sentimental type. You know I said 100 million, but it could be more! No way to be sure. A costly set-up, and my idea too. Even so, clean slate and we go 50-50. Tony won't go for it. Don't tell him who the guy is! - Even so. You asked for help, this is easy money. The Maltese's 25 mil in one score. I'll explain it to him, but no guarantee he'll say yes. No! No! No! And no Dick! I already told you no! You didn't want to sell the club, now you want us to become gangsters! We don't have enough problems?! It's a tiny friendly redistribution. P?p?re laid it all out. This isn't you Dick. You've gone crazy. Listen to me Tony. Try and understand. We're stuck here and have no choice. Tell yourself that guy's a crook as well. If he smuggled while we busted our asses in Indochina that wouldn't surprise me. Hello Mr. Duffy. - Hello Leopold, I must see your bosses. Impossible right now, but I always take care of the champagne orders. It is about the orders. - I was about to call you. Really? Your clients get thirsty, serve water. They won't be drinking my stuff anymore. You're not selling champagne anymore? Why yes, just not to the Tip-Tap. But why? - Why? P-Q-R-S-T...Tip-Tap: April 1st 350K, unpaid. The 15th 210K, unpaid. What are your bosses' plans? - They just started, you must trust them. Now that I've explained, you admit it can work out? Do you have P?p?re's number? - Yes. - Call him right now. With me standing right here, tell him we're not interested. Go on. - O.K. Hello? This is Dick. I'm sorry but that thing isn't for us. Don't count on us. - No harm done kid, I tried to fix it. I'd ask that you both forget this, especially you. Sure...well...goodbye. How'd he take it. - Not too hard. Hello gentlemen. - Ah hello. What can we do for you? You'll need to find a new supplier. Debts will go to our recovery people. If I could live my life over again I'd laugh when I once cried I'd build up what I destroyed and I'd make old miseries into a midnight bonfire If I could live my life over again over the remnants of my wanderings I'd know well to tell you I love you She sings well... - To you, who I have never told. Two men are asking for you. - What type? I should not be surprised if they were cops. Have them come in. Judiciary police. We have some questions for you gentlemen. You own and run this nightclub? We agree about this? - Yes. We came to ask what you know... Everything you know about a man named Chang. A Chinese who got killed last night. - Where did you meet this Chang? Firstly, it might not be the same Chang. There are a lot of Changs. Don't worry. It's the same guy or we wouldn't be here. Well... We met in Indochina. - Indochina's pretty big. Saigon. - Ahh. Saigon, and when you saw him last? Hard to say. You know Chinks. Here 3 times a day for weeks, then not again for months... Ah? Evidently. Well. You've been very helpful. I suppose. Until next time gentlemen. Well then... Here every night at this time? - Certainly, yes. - Thank you... We may have more things to ask. ...To you who I have never told... If I could live my life over again... I'd charter a few huge ships I'd pick up all those I love here While ignoring unimportant people who are the main thing to forget In this long voyage's destiny You'd be master of the crew We'd leave on the greatest voyage We'd choose daybreak of course If I could live again for love! Advance on interests, payable in 24 hours. That's alright, it's on the house. Come. Yes. Trust me, it's the right solution. We have to settle with this Maltese. He's been here for a while and won't let go. So if your thing is tomorrow or next day at the latest...we're with you. I can guarantee it's in the bag, as for timing, frankly, I don't know. That's out of my hands. - But we're in a hurry. If it's the Maltese don't worry, I'll pay him to wait a while. I thought you wouldn't come. - Had to tell you dad has me at golf tomorrow. Again? - I really wanted to see you. Your father is overdoing it. I have to fly. It's certain he's not going tomorrow. The father is taking her. Perfect. Go back to Tony and tell him I called to set it up. We'll meet in your office tomorrow at 8. The Maltese is still there? No, he just left. - I'll call him at home. So? What do we do? We start by saving 25 million. P?p?re called back, we're on for tomorrow. Just as well. Get it over with. What's the plan? He'll be here around 8. Did he mention the Maltese? - Sure, he said he'd fix it so he can wait. I hope everyone understood. One more thing to settle up. I saw the Maltese last night. He was worried, I had to front him your 25 million. You won't hear from him again. You owe me the money now. You said the Tip-Tap gives you more pain than pleasure? And we'll say it again. Well...then I'll take it back for the 25 you owe me. You only need to sign. Because law is law, and I respect it. Now go get the money, and you can forget all this. Wait! Do you have your guns? - We have them. Best insurance against nerves... Never bring bullets! You know the maxim: Show strength so you never need to use it. For avoiding sunburns. Brigitte! I'm coming! I'm late. Sorry. - No matter. There he is! Go down there like we planned, I'll take care of the guy at the crossing. P?p?re forgot a bullet in the barrel. - What will you do? We can always use it to make some noise. Let's go. The guy will sleep for a little while! Will this take long? No. We'll do this quickly. Hands behind your neck. Go ahead. Hurry. Well your job's done. Easy, see? Go find Brigitte now. How's it going? - I think it's working. You'll let me even the score? - I owe you that. What's going on? I thought I'd come ahead of you. Where's Tony? - Golfing. - Go this way. Weight is right on! Get in back. Here's this hour's news: The Council President met with the Bolivian ambassador... The Assembly voted 340-160 last night to raise 56 billion in new taxes... We don't care! We won't be paying taxes on what's in the trunk of the car! ...during their meeting in Tangiers. From Paris: At 1 AM, in front of his home was murdered Boris Shivara... Of uncertain nationality, but known in crime circles as the Maltese. Police are investigating what is believed to be a revenge killing linked to the murder of an Asian in the Bois-de-Boulogne the previous night. And now for more music... That's upsetting, don't you think P?p?re? It doesn't bother you Tony and I are in hot water? The Maltese said if something happened to him we'd have Chang pinned on us. Before plugging him you should have thought of us. All this to save 25 million. You'll never understand business. - Yes, well I'm starting to! Very well even! We may be dumb, but you're garbage! Come on now. - You killed the Maltese to save 25, as for the loot back there I'm sure you don't plan to give us a franc! You're probably thinking of killing both Tony and I! That's why you don't care if the cops are all after us! And you think they'll find cold meat? Well you're wrong! Because you're paying for this! You'll pay for this! Don't clown around, kid, you forgot your gun isn't loaded. Wrong again, P?p?re! You left a bullet in the gun barrel! You shut up! Take me out and we're all done for. That's the best thing to do. Police. Antoine Rossi? Yes, that's me. - Please follow us. Why? - You knew a guy named Chang? Yes. So what? That's not permitted? Don't be a smartass. Chang was killed night before last. You saw him during the evening. You can't be saying... Miss! Mr. Geoffrain is on the phone. He says it's very urgent. Tony! Tony! Wait a moment. This is surely a mistake, Tony. - Surely. - Surely. I believe in you, you know? I trust you. Your phone call, nothing serious? Dad was attacked on the road. Put him to sleep and stole his car, but he's not hurt. He's on his way. Ah? But I'm saying he's alright! That's enough Miss, we're in a hurry. THE END THE END Subtitles: eunoia (KG - FreakyFlicks)
