- Where's Duval? - In your office. I was waiting for him at the photoengraver's! Put me through to photography. Has Mr Delaprade come yet? He's gone. Take it yourself, for heaven's sake! - What about the copy? - I don't have it! - Ask for it! - I have already. This is to go to typesetting... Right away! Georges Carpentier's dead? No, it's Carpentier the biologist. Alright. Photography? Oh, it's you? Put me through to photography. Is Mr Delaprade not coming? I've been waiting for him for an hour. - He's gone out. - How can that be? - You would've seen him pass. - But I don't know him. So it seems. - What's it about? - About a novel. - A novel by you? - Yes. Come back in the morning, between 9 and 10. Thank you, Sir, goodbye. When are you coming to lunch at home? Oh... photography...? They're waiting for the prints for The Charles Disaster and Flower Festival The vocation of your child may be aroused... by buying this ingenious toy. Consider that when you buy an Areolex... which you can have for such a modest sum! Not 20 francs, not 15 francs... A mere 10 francs! For your child it may be the dawn of a wonderful career. A simple thrust powered by a rubber band... and it flies gracefully through the air... returning in stylish curves to the hands of the launcher. - Give me 5 of them. - 5? I have a lot of kids to indulge in my family, and this is fun. He's a crony of yours. You bought some yesterday. Yes, but they're already broken. So give me 5. It's an interesting toy for kids and for grown-ups too. He must be a crony. I'm glad I found you again. He's a crony. Yes, he's a crony! They're tough cookies in this neighbourhood. What are you annoyed about? Annoyed?! With you only turning up now! I wasted an hour waiting at The Dispatch and all for nothing. - Someone you know? - No. - Is his name Delaprade? - Yes. - He's the boss? - Yes. I think Raymond is going to read your novel! - You know Delaprade? - I believe I do. - Do you have a copy? - I've got 5 of them. It came back to me earlier... If it's him, he was my lieutenant at Verdun. Look out... We've got customers. Yes, Sir... Here we have the Areolex. Constructed on the most modern principles. A simple projection... and the machine flies gracefully through the air... returning with sweeping curves... to the hands of the launcher. Scram, before someone starts abusing us. - Quick. You'll miss your train. - Indeed. Goodbye. Hurry! Yes, yes... I'm coming. Listen... About your pal... His name's Marcel Mettine? No, that's a nom de plume. He mixed his girlfriend's name with his own. - It's an anagram? - Not at all. Just a mixture of the two names. It doesn't matter. Mettine it is. I'll give the manuscript to the head of the reading committee. I write For reading. Now it will be read. Come in! I can't promise anything else just now. I could sell manuscripts by the kilo. Take this to Mr de Maz√®re. He's not there. Leave it on his desk. There's something I must say to you... Charles, my office factotum, wants to leave. He's old. There's a job for you here if you want it.. It bothers me to allow my old comrade to fall by the wayside. Think about it. Goodbye for now. Let me know within 48 hours. Understood. See you. Yes, my friend, I'm coming! I've been with the Beaux-Arts director. - Come back here a minute, please. Come on! Perhaps you can explain what this is? It was hidden in the split peas. It's a novel. I can see that... I know how to read. That's why you wanted to busy yourself with the dried vegetables You said you were relieving ME! Hypocrite! No, don't, Mum...! I can't help being curious. Handsome lover. Nice looking guy. In beans, like a weevil. My compliments on your hiding-place. Seen that... seen that... May I? I haven't seen the lentils. - No, you're not going to... - Why shouldn't I?! My love, my darling... I want an explanation, Micheline. Clement wants to marry me. A slacker, who has no real job! - He does - What? - In business. - What business? - They sell aeroplanes. Planes?! He looks pretty hard up for a plane-merchant. He has a strange look about him. He's going though a bad patch. He has worries. - Has he been in prison? - Certainly not, Mum. - Well, I'm going out. - Hold on! Give me that! What are you going to do with it? I'll give it back myself. Wait there a moment! What would this be?! Yesterday, I met the queen mother, acting offended, as always. How nice. As stiff as the law.... Her hair topped with a beautiful garden of dandelions. Whats he mean? My new hat? My hat with the gold buttons? What an idiot! Very well, I'll get to work... and toss all this in the fire. - You can't do that! - Why shouldn't I? You scram! But that's his manuscript! I don't care! Get out of here! - Hello Mrs Chartrin. - Do you have any dandelions? No, I'm out of them. Where's Micheline going? She's going to cooking class. It keeps her mind off other things. Do you love me? Because I love you. I love you... I love you... Would you mind moving off my doorstep, Sir? Oh, I'm sorry, Sir. So ma-in-law wants to burn my manuscript? We've really hit it off, she and I! Maybe she's right. Maybe that's what my scribbling deserves. Are you saying that to make me angry? What are you sad about? You'll see... your new name, Marcel Mettine, is going to bring you luck. Marcel Mettine, of The French Academy... recipient of the Legion d'honneur. Get your copy of the Marcel Mettine novel! Excuse me, Marcel Mettine. Him again?! Marcel Mettine... Why are you sad...? You have so much talent. My talent doesn't help me from being just a pedlar. It's just a bad phase. It's lasting a bit too long. I don't think I'll ever get out of it. I'll be stuck at the bottom of the ladder. How will I hang on to you? Clement, what's got into you today? Nothing... Everything. I think Raymond is going to drop me. Well, it's a crummy job. - What will you do? - I don't know. I don't blame him. Life is every man for himself. I'll do that for you. What a nuisance! Ah, there a long time! Hey... you going back upstairs? Take this to the records room. Excuse me, Sir... Just a sec... Come in. - Mr Mazere... - It's DE Mazere. Take this to typesetting. Yes, Mr de Mazere. Just a second. You have a lot of work, eh? Yes, and I'm leaving for Lyon in half an hour. Just a second. What was it again? The Colossus of Rhodes... The Cage of Nightingales... All Woman... Too bad... Relieve me of this. All the same... looks nice to me. The cage of Nightingales. As much so as the rest of them. - You enjoy reading? - Very much so. So take the one in tomorrow's paper. Saturday in The Dispatch a new masterpiece of fiction. I've not succeeded to that extent. You mean a novel written by you? That'd be a scream. You can go now. Certainly Mr de Mazere. He's a bit too familiar! I can't stand him! There! Oh! The mail. Cutie! I'm giving several signatures. You should know this at least... You're the only one... that I solicit apart from my colleagues. I swear that's true. I was saying this again recently to a friend... I could sell all those manuscripts by the kilo... That was me. I didn't ask you, old chap. Be off. My dearest wish would be to deal with you. There, there...! I'm leaving for the press conference in Lyon. Here's my novel for tomorrow's edition. Take it to typesetting with the attached slip. You're going to miss your train, Sir. Take my calls. I'm gone. Mr de Mazere? He's left. It's in the bag. Ad on the front page in 36pt, novel. And off you go! The Glass Cage? It can't be! The customary sun, for its molecular and daily work... landed that night on the hydrophilic mass... of enpurpled cumulus. He's really tripped up here. of enpurpled cumulus! - Where's Duval? - In your office. Is Mr de Mazere in? He's left. - I'll come back. - Do that. The Glass Cage. After all, I don't care. When I, on the 30th of October 1935... was appointed supervisor at the boarding school of Eaubonne-sur-Loire... as I crossed the large porch... I felt as if closing behind me... were the doors of an unforeseen prison. I like that! There's no title. I'll get it wrong... Sir... please! Just wait a moment... I'll be right back. Hello, chaps! Here's the novel and the ad. Thanks. Get to work. - Is it alright like that? - That's OK. Goodbye gents... Do a good job. What's this? The Cage of Nightingales? What's that? Do you have the page 1 ad? Yes, here it is. - Get me Mr de Mazere. - He's in Lyon. Get me Mr Delaprade, then. Marcel Mettine? Engaged! No... forget it. I'm going to cop it. I've got the ad. OK, let's go. - So, you coming? - Yes. This guy was with me at the Conservatory. - I'm not going through there. - Why not? I don't want to walk past that dairy shop. I'll meet you at Jean-Jaures Square. Be quick. Let's avoid the queen mother. - Hello, ma'am. - Oh, it's you! You're almost looking smart. Plane business good? Going very well. I have some big orders. That's nice. - Walk with me for a bit. - Sure. Seeing you seem to be serious... call by to see my daughter one of these days. I'd be glad to.. So you don't like my hat? I like it very much. The dandelions are gold buttons. Not real gold. Why are those boys looking at us? I don't know. Do you like to listen to people's conversations? What on earth are they laughing at? They're probably amused by my hat and cane. Haven't you seen something? Were you going to the races? - Are you a gambler? - Oh no. Why the binoculars? I wouldn't want a gambler as a son-in-law. Just between ourselves, it's to make me look like a gambler. Because I'm going to Auteuil to meet some big clients who are gamblers. I understand. Why don't you come tonight? I can't make it tonight. I've a big dinner at the Claridge. - Very well, make it tomorrow. - Tomorrow's fine. - Perfect. Tomorrow evening then. - Au revoir. He's well educated, this boy. Well brought up. Whew! Oh! You crook! You scoundrel! You crook You scoundrel! I'm pooped! I'm so fed up! No! No! No! You're out, whether you did it on purpose or not. You didn't know we were running a novel by Gerard de Mazere? I tried to... Shut up! Perhaps you can explain it to me? Shut up! I'm certainly well rewarded, with you. You who saved my life, has to do this to Mei? You'll leave at the end of the week. Get out! The rest of you back to work. - Mr de Mazere for you. - I'm not here. Have you fully understood? You're not to set foot outside the door! Fool of a girl! You've no feelings! But I'll protect you in spite of yourself. Come what may. A buffoon! A bum! My daughter is mad! It's for your own good. Some day you'll thank me. That weevil of yours isn't the only one to use that book title. The Cage of Nightingales What did you say, Mum? Mr Marcel Mettine found it first. He probably copied it. What's got into you?! Micheline, where are you going? I forbid you to go out! That brat of a girl! - Hello. - Hello, madam. You're lucky having a big girl like that. - He doesn't know? - That his novel has appeared? - No. He would've told me. - Where is he? I would've liked to break it to him. - I've been... - Excuse me. Good night. I've been kicked out. It was worth it. You poor thing, Raymond! See you tomorrow. There's still this clash with my mother... Oh yes. This should stir things. He won't do something silly? Good evening. - Is Mr Delaprade here? - Yes Sir. That's the famous Pimprenant. The Academy member? I'm worried sick! There's no reason for you to be worried.. Counselor, I'm all yours. Let's go. Tell me, who's this Marcel Mettine? An unknown. He won't be around for long. You mean... you actually like it? Very much. The story is simple, but it's full of warmth and sensitivity. Oh! Haven't you read it? Of course we have, Counselor... Let's go now. It's worthwhile encouraging newcomers now and then. Are you going to give me an explanation? He talks about the boarding school at Eaubonne. That's where your cousin is. Yes, Mum. He mentions him. He mentions Roger? Me too. You'll understand when you read it. - You've read it? - No. You burned it. - He had another copy? - Yes, fortunately. Don't be pig-headed... Give me a smile. When you've got back together, you can get married. If he's writing novels, maybe he can make a living. Yes, but where is he? After this hit with the paper, you'll hear from him tomorrow. Read this for me! You want me to? When I, on the 30th of October 1935... was appointed supervisor at the boarding school of Eaubonne-sur-Loire... as I crossed the large porch... I felt as if closing behind me... were the doors of an unforeseen prison. I found myself at the entrance to a shadowy courtyard. It was ringed by high walls... beyond which one had a glimpse of gloomy-looking buildings. It had been designed to hold dangerous maniacs. How could anyone have thought it suitable for children? I was so moved by what I saw... that I didn't hear someone approaching me. I was startled when he tapped my arm. Introductions were over quickly. He was Old Maxence. He fulfilled the functions caretaker, nurse... storekeeper and glazier. He seemed like a good man. He looked like the actor Genin. The same eyes, the same ironic yet friendly smile... and the very same voice. Yes, I've been told that I look like him. - Don't you know him? - No. I never leave here. The lads have told me. There are some who went to the movies before coming here. Come this way. This is my garden here. Congratulations. It's pretty. - The boys are orphans? - Yes, for the most part. But there are also some children placed by their families. Runaways, delinquents. My vegetable garden. Problem kids. "Naughty little boys." Come through. Are there young ones here? The kids here are 10 to 14 - 15. They're worse than big ones. So they're put here to be reformed. It seems we're getting there. Look at the number of panes they break every week! - Mr Rachin is the principal? - Yes. - Is he strict? - Is he! But you seem a mild-mannered sort... are you here as a supervisor? I trust you come to enjoy it. Here's my nursing station. Nice, eh? The door's shut. There's the principal. A solemn looking man was walking towards me. He was scrutinising me severely. Are you Clement Mathieu? You are late. Promptness is the first requirement of a supervisor. What's up? Answer me! Take a look at the nature of our boarders. A slingshot! The scoundrels. Nothing less than a thrashing! We'll see who has the last word! I'm in pain. Is my eye damaged? You ring the bell. The wound needs to be dressed. He's the nurse. How many times have I told you to lock your door?! And he still bawls me out! I told you to ring the bell! - Where is it? - Staring you in the face! Everyone to assembly! We're going to see the end of these pranks of yours! Does this sort of thing happen often? 8 days ago, a supervisor almost had his skull split. Are you supposed to be ringing?! That's enough! I quite agree. I rejoined Mr Rachin. He was standing on the steps of the stairs, hurling abuse. I want a bit of quiet up there! You could hear the heavy clogs of the children coming down. The sound of their footsteps made my heart beat faster. All of a sudden I was afraid. These kids were overwhelming me, and I couldn't help admiring this man... who coolly faced this young cohort charging towards him. There they were. I was curious about them. They looked like innocent children. But deep in some eyes, a devilish flame seemed to burn. But suspicion is dispelled by a young flashing smile. Mr Rachin was quite unmoved. Silence! His methods are not new. In front of the impressive array of the students... the centre of the quadrangle was occupied by teachers and supervisors. I was in an awkward position. All those young eyes were fixed on me. To bolster my upcoming authority, I tried to strike a firm, dignified pose. I tried my best. But my natural timidity undid my intentions. Fortunately, Mr Rachin's address... distracted attention from me. injuring Mr Maxence. If I don't find the guilty one... each one of you will spend 6 hours in solitary confinement. This until the culprit confesses or is denounced. Understood? 1, 2, 3. Nobody. Just as I thought. Mr Fennec, give me the roll. This is Mr Mathieu, our new supervisor. He will name the first to be punished, with total impartiality. Mr Mathieu, come and read out a name at random. Silence! Romet. Romet! Here! But Sir, I've done nothing... I didn't do it. No I don't want to! I don't want to go in the dungeon! I told you I didn't do anything! I don't want to! The culprit having not revealed himself... will receive a fortnight in the dungeon, when we find him, or when he is denounced by his mates. All recreation is canceled. Silence! That'll encourage informers. For a newcomer you have generous illusions. We'll review the situation in a week. In the meantime, Mr Regent will show you your duties. - What time's your train? - 1.40. - I'll come with you to the station. - That's not necessary. - Why are you leaving? - I'm fed up! It's the only way we control them... fear of the dungeon. Especially since a rat bit Lequerec. Say, Lequerec, what's news? And little Laugier, too. Remember... Lequerec and Laugier. Bad through and through. Have nothing to do with him. Nothing to do with those two. They weigh the same, but it seems to help. It was Lequerec who wounded Maxence. I heard him say that he'd set the elastic too low. Maxence had him punished for a broken pane. It was revenge. I said nothing as I don't belong there any longer. I have to hurry. I need to buy a ticket. I shook hands with Mr Regent who said to me again... "Heavy handed is the only way. I had to learn the hard way." "'Have fun." I returned, feeling down, to that ancient pile. What sort of life are those kids going to make for me? Their faces danced in my memory. Which one was the terrible Lequerec? Which one Laugier? When I reached the wall, I got an attack of nerves. How's your eye? No good, Sir... I'm going to lie down. Anything I can do for you? Nothing. You've got a class at 2. You're going to be late! Blessed door is shut again. Has a will of its own. See you later. Take care! The class was shared between the principal and Mr Langlois. I didn't have to wait to make his acquaintance. Her's the new supervisor. You're the replacement? Excellent. See you soon. His salute confirmed my inferiority. He's the funniest here. That's promising! What are you doing there? He's been punished by Mr Rachin. For what? He wrote the word "deth" on a wall. D-E-T-H And he added "Deth to Rachin". He didn't know how to spell "death". So he has to his grammar at arm's length. He'll never learn anything doing that. There you are! Take the class... I have to see someone. Listen to them. Just listen to them! I don't want to hear anything anymore. - Count on me. - Make sure! We'll see how you work. As I was climbing, I heard a strange rumbling. A sound like breaking waves with a cavalry charge It was those rascals who were waiting for me... no doubt about that. I was soon outside the classroom The lion-tamer outside the cage... must feel the same apprehension. I made my decision... I quickly opened the door wide. For a second, there was silence. The class and I were taking each other's measure. "So far, so good", I thought optimistically. Eye to eye, each side evaluated itself. One side, the 66-headed monster, the other, the trainer. This monster seemed to fear me. It was only a momentary advantage. Suddenly a terrific storm erupted joyfully. Silence! Silence! Be quiet! Well behaved. A good start... Congratulations. Be seated! Of course it's you. It's always you. Come here! What did he do? He did nothing, Sir. Nothing? You were going to punish him. Not at all. I called him to question him. And I was going to call for quiet. You certainly needed it. Mr Rachin didn't seem very convinced. But taken aback by my answer, he left in a huff. I'd scored a point. I'd refused to help the principal to punish the boy. Go to the corner. Quick. My authority was growing. Let's get it clear... I don't need the principal to settle any trivial matters. I want to start afresh. Good happenings make good friends. So... Which one of you was responsible for Mr Maxence's injury? I repeat... Which one of you was responsible for Mr Maxence's injury? Well... As I expected. I find that your cruelty is only equaled by your cowardice. But you see... I really don't have to be told. I already know who's the guilty one. Yes, gentlemen... Does that amaze you? I know the name of the culprit. So... if he reveals himself right away, of his own accord... I don't want someone else telling me... he'll just get 6 hours in the dungeon. and I shall have the class's punishment lifted. Now, if he doesn't come forward... I shall identify him... and throw him to the tender mercies of the principal. So that's it. I'm giving him 30 seconds. Starting now. Strange how you're all looking towards my right. He must be over there. 10 seconds. Mr Culprit... you're about to reveal yourself as a coward. You're about to punish all your pals because of your cowardice. 25 seconds. No one? Too bad. Attention... That's it! I shall now give you his name. Lequerec. Who is Lequerec? Me. So it's you! You don't waste your time. Congratulations. You're accumulating it. Silence! - You wounded Mr Maxence. - It wasn't me! I'm not asking, I'm telling you. Follow me. You'll be going to a nice concert... put on just for you... by the principal. Lucky boy! I need to leave someone in charge... Someone very sensible. If I can trust my infallible flair, that would be... Mr Laugier. Quiet now! Who is Laugier? Me, Sir. So, it's you? Hi there. I know that in reality, you're the worst-behaved student here. You don't look it... but the really bad ones often look like little angels. So, go down by the blackboard. You're responsible for keeping order during my absence. The strongest leaders can control their friends. Show us what you can do. Don't bother tucking your shirt in if you don't want to. Come with me now.... Off to the concert. Hey, boys...! I'm gonna draw the head's ugly mug. Quiet.. We don't want to spoil it! While Laugier was exercising his talents... followed by Lequerec, I reached the principal's office. The closer we got, the slower he walked At the corner of the hall, he stopped. One month of solitary... Congratulations! So Sir... no solitary! Why not? There's already one in the dungeon. In your place. Please, no solitary! There are rats. - You were the one bitten. - Yes, Sir. Who's that? Leclerc... a runaway. Does he often run off? All the time. Come on then. No, Sir! Maybe we could arrange both. You seriously injured Mr Maxence. But I'd rather convince the principal for you to avoid the dungeon. But you'll pay for it nevertheless. You accept that, or would you prefer...? - Oh, no Sir! - Good. So I'm appointing you home-nurse to Old Maxence. Plus the beard! Just what are you up to? Where have you been? About Mr Maxence... You should not leave your post for any reason whatever. This boy will get 48 hours in the dungeon. I want to hear nothing from this class again! He had some slight justification, but to roast me in front of the kids... As they say in the theatre... I carried on. So what is that supposed to be? That's the head. It's supposed to be the headmaster. Is nonsense like this the reason you're being punished? You come out as foolish, conceited and incompetent. That's a good combination. Stand there. Turn sideways. I'm not much at drawing... but I can still give you... your look... as the prize you deserve. I wanted to score points. I took advantage of my gift for drawing It was important the resemblance should be obvious. Not to forget the shirt hanging out. That can go. The impression was good. I had just enough ability to make it a success. So Mr Laugier. Go to the corner. So, to work. One point to me, I thought, seeing them complying. However, my troubles were far from over. As the doctor was checking his dressing... Maxence looked at Eloi and said to him... Very nice of you to come and look after me. You can imagine how Eloi felt. - Is he your young nurser? - Yes, Doctor. Mr Clement asked for a volunteer to look after me... and this is the one who raised his hand. They say you're a bad lot. But that's not true... You're a good little lad. We have to accept there's a bad apple in every barrel. But with the thug who caused your injury... what base instinct would drive him to such a filthy deed? Only a taste for evil. To do evil for evil's sake. Because, Maxence, you're such a decent fellow! I swear I would punish him, that one. I'm no sadist, but I'd give him an uncomfortable 15 minutes. Don't forget these are unfortunate boys. And when you think about it... they are the ones deserving pity. Old Maxence's a nice guy, eh? I'm talking to you, Lequerec! He's a nice guy, isn't he? Yes. He's so shy... so shy! Good little boy, aren't you? Yesterday, Popino got into trouble. You are a dunce... Another question... If you give me the wrong answer, you'll be punished. How did Marshal Ney die? I'm waiting. He died... He died from a hunting accident. Zero. You'll write out 200 times... "Marshal Ney was shot dead." You told me that I was responsible for my class. So? I would like to try an experiment. An experiment? On the subject of Mr Maxence's injury. I'd like you to lift the punishment on the whole class... so I can punish the guilty one, and keep his name to myself. - Provided you know who. - Of course. Certainly! You keep it to yourself! You really think you're something, don't you! You think you'll find the guilty one? Don't forget, they all cover for each other. But this is great, Mr Sherlock Holmes. If you succeed, okay... I'll lift the class punishment. Except that you'll never find the guilty one. Or else I'm the king of fools. I have the guilty one, Sir. Who is it? You just authorised me not to tell it. So be it. Your pretentious manners irritate me. Get it right! Just don't give me cause for complaint about your class! I have them well in hand. Don't speak too soon. I was the one who spoke too soon. In the evening, as I was going to the dormitory... the commotion made me realise that my authority was not absolute. Ready, boys... One, two, three... Have you seen the big supe, supe, supe... Could he be in the molasses Supe, supe, supe He wears funny shoes... the supe! He has funny shoes, supe, supe, supe! What is it, boys? So it's you, Bagot? Yes. I didn't do anything. - Yes, you were singing. - No, Sir. You were singing but you were off key. You don't realize? Start again. Have you seen the new supe? Supe, supe, supe... Supe, supe, supe... Come on. Have you seen the new supe... If you don't want to sing, I can take you to the principal. I don't mind you making fun... but do it in front of me.. I like to have fun with mates. Now... Have you seen the new supe? Supe, supe, supe Could he be in the molasses? Supe, supe, supe He has funny shoes... supe, supe, supe! Don't you realise you sound off? If you like to sing, I will teach you. We'll just ask Mr Bagot... to encourage us from the sidelines. Alright... all off to bed! Goodnight. What will the coming days bring me? I could feel, through the dividing curtain... ..those big young eyes fixed on the shadow... of the strange "supe" who seemed to want to join their games. Would I ever get the better of those little devils? I imagined the coming gloomy days... and depressing nights surrounded by bad children. The next day it was raining. Teeming, like in a movie. And my day started hopelessly. I was waiting to start class... when I saw the street-sweeper coming towards me. She was trudging along in this greyness. Could it be she was coming to reveal the entry of happiness in my life? Someone is asking for little Laugier in the parlour. Impossible. He's being punished. Punishments forbid visits as you'd know. Could you go and explain that to that person. I think she's his cousin. Full of ill-feeling, I went to the parlour. I was cold. One of my shoes was leaking... and I had a pimple on my nose. Everything going wrong. Yet what was going on suddenly? - It's you, mademoiselle...? - Yes. I want to see my cousin, Roger Laugier. I'm sorry, but that's not possible. - He's being punished. - What for? I couldn't take my eyes off her. Suddenly, my brain was not obeying anymore. She was talking to me, but I heard nothing. Delicious minutes, whose memory brings to mind... the lines from Musset... Blessed be the moment Where in my sad heart... penetrated his eyes Charming sweetness. For a week, by light burned past midnight every night. I wrote my journal. My victories, my defeats of these rascals. Revelations of an unhappy supervisor, revelations of a man. Here are some extracts. January 12... Laugier is still in punishment. He set fire to his sheets when trying to smoke a shoelace. I can't wait to see him leave the dungeon. He doesn't miss, but when he comes out... his pretty cousin might come to see him. January 16 My choral attempt is pretty conclusive. This evening I'm starting to get the boys to work. They have a feeling for music and seem to like it.. They already work as a small choir. Everyone sings about his misdeeds, to the great joy of his pals. In the kitchen, I eat all the terrine... I steal from the plates next to me and afterward I'm still hungry. Whose turn, gentlemen? I'm a great worker... who likes sums... a long way away! Gentlemen, if you please... I'd advise you especially not to make fun of it. - 4 times 7? - 27. - 28, Sir. - Remember that. I'm a great worker... who likes sums... a long way away! When the maths prof questions us... I play the martyr... Please Sir, I have to be excused! We're the happy numbers We, the boys of D'Eaubonne. January 18.... Old Maxence is not doing well. I almost felt sorry for Lequerec. He passed the bandages to the doctor. The wound was not a pretty sight. I sent him to sit apart. He was green. I believe that by paying for his fault, he's buying a better heart. January 20. Mr Rachin was good enough to see me. I came to... I'm still finding graffiti in the toilets. Rude and insulting messages... about me, of course. Nothing about the kids. You wanted to Se me? Quite simply, I'd like to form a choir. What? You want to ruin my whole disciplinary system?! A choir? You wouldn't extract two notes out of them... Or I really am the king of... No Sir, don't say the king of anything. Why not? Because they're singing already. - Really? - Just a little. So why are you asking my authorisation? I do not like your manners! Understand?! I've other matters to worry about. But then, hold on... Let them sing! Off you go. You'll soon give up with singing. Thank you for your support, Sir. January 22... With the class, after school hours... I start working seriously on the choir. Now together. I have some trouble with Bagot that I can't resolve. Like this.... Do, Mi, Sol, Do! - Do... You seem to be making fun of it. But look now... You're not a soprano. - Do, mi, mi. - Mi! You're still on the wrong floor... Down to the cellar! Come here. Hold your hands like this. I hereby appoint you as music stand. He's finished his punishment. Behind my stern expression I contained my joy at seeing Laugier again. But Mr carelessness betrays me. I say, without any forethought... In the letters you send to your parents... Get them to come... They could see you on the 1st and 3rd Thursday of the month. Laugier, what did I just say? I don't know. You can write to your family to come see you. You have a cousin you like, don't you. She could see you on the 1st or 3rd Thursday of the month. Or both days, if she wants. Do you understand? Only those being punished can't be in it. They're pretty quiet. Do you have no wish to see that pretty cousin of yours? I almost felt like I could kill him. But he just gave me an enigmatic look. Could he read my thoughts? No, I don't think so. I changed the subject. Laugier, we're putting a choir together. Do you want to be part of it? Me? How's your voice? Go up the scale. I don't like looking stupid. Quiet! Do you want to go back to where you came from? So... scale... now! I'm stunned... He has the voice of a nightingale. Such purity of sound! He was not prepared to accept the least discipline. He's a real brat. His only saving grace is his cousin. Yesterday, during recess, my heart jumped for joy. Old Marie came to tell me that little Laugier had a visitor. At last! I made like I was looking for Laugier, who I could actually see quite clearly. Mr Clement, there he is! I ran to spruce myself up, as I used to say as a boy... when my mother dressed me on Sundays. Alas, my wardrobe is less complete. I came to the parlor, trembling like a schoolboy... to tell the delightful Micheline... What a pretty name! that her cousin would be coming. But, hell and damnation! I only found a stout lady wearing a bird's nest hat... looking very aggressive. I did not dare go in and talk to her. She can wait. As it's not Micheline, I don't care! Described as a stout lady. How nice of him! The end. To be continued next week. If only I'd known! He insults me about my hats. If you hadn't burned his manuscript, we'd have the next episode. Thank you! I'm in no hurry. We'll have to wait a week. Yes... such a long time! Where might he be right now? Maybe this is the solution. Oh, Mum, you never burned it! So go on reading it out loud. - A stout lady wearing... - I've heard that already. Part 2. February 3. My choir is a good idea... It seems that these kids are taking refuge in the music. Only Laugier, of course, is giving me trouble. Faster, Laugier. That's not the rhythm. I already told you yesterday! I sing as I feel it. You sang out of tempo. Don't be cheeky. It's your parents fault... You have a beautiful voice. They must have paid a lot for you. Let's go... Not - so - wicked! Not - so - wicked! I'm not so wicked... Since the king's son loves me... Margot Margot plowed the vines, vines vines... If it flowers, I'll be queen... Margot If it dies... I lose... Margot I do not want you to touch that skeleton. Go back to your seats... and take out your physics books. Mr Langlois won't be late. Indeed, here is the respectable Mr Langlois, known as Bug-beard. Sir. How come? It's you who gets the boys to sing? Something wrong? Not at all. I love music. Little ditties in particular. I sang myself, in my younger days. "Little shepherdess, I fear your charms..." "Your soul ignites But you do not love" March 10. The operation on Mr Maxence took place this morning. A long and dangerous procedure taking over an hour. When the stretcher passed down the hallway... Lequerec was very anxious. Is he dead? He's dead! No, don't worry. He's out of danger. And I thought, seeing those tears flow... 'You're out of danger, too. ' March 15. Random days passing, I'm scoring new victories on the stubborn ones. All these kids are starting to come round to me. Yesterday, I tasted the only happiness to which my existence aspires. She is here! As Mr Rachin still had the class... we had time to chat together. It's funny how thought goes beyond words. In certain circumstances... you can talk sweetly about the weather... about your favourite poets... But none of that removes one thought... I love you. And the beautiful eyes that you speak to, understand you. Oh, you make me so happy! And the beautiful eyes that you speak to, understand you. Oh, you make me so happy! It's my favourite verse. "It cries in my heart as it cries..." I saw him... it's Laugier. He's running off over there. Fine! If that's the way he is I don't want to see him. You tell him that I shan't be back. You'll be punishing me. Why do you say things you don't really mean? What's going on? Are they fighting? Come now.... What's this all about? Get up off the ground! Why were you hitting Laugier? Bagot? And you? You were on top. So I'll never know... You'll be punished. Let me see. Take Laugier to Old Marie to get patched up. Tell me why they were fighting. Because Laugier played a dirty trick on you. Oh? You've become popular... My compliments. March 22. Laugier needed to be taught a lesson. The opportunity to give it to him came last night. What I heard was a dog's breakfast. Once again. What about my solo? - What solo? - My solo. There's no solo any more. What you did to me earlier discouraged me. Especially nasty idiots. What you did to me earlier discouraged me. Especially nasty idiots. I can't stand nasty idiots who are also pretentious. No one is indispensable. No one at all. You'll see. We can very well do without you. Look. Or rather, listen. We'll repeat... More singing... Always singing! - What about their lessons? - Done, Sir. Get back to them. What do you think this is? Everyone back to their seats! Make sure this one completes his punishment. Over here. Inkwell on the tablet. Arms higher. Do you want a desk? He's to write 200 times, "I like the history of France". What's the reason for that sir? Simply clowning during my history lesson. Keep an eye on him. The ink ran down onto his fingers. It was a cruel punishment The child wasn't able to write. I confess I felt sorry for the little rascal. But how would I get him out of it... without prejudicing discipline? I was already hearing what was being said behind my back. These lads knew me now. He won't be there long. Then I found a way out I meant it, too. Isn't that good writing! Nice! Aren't you ashamed to write "France" so badly? This is shameful! A pig like you isn't worthy to write that word. Go to your seat! You'll finish your punishment sitting down. What did I tell you? Bordenave, back to work! His eyes seemed to say... "You taking on the bad guy?" "You don't need to say anything." "We know you now. You're a brother." March 28... This morning Mr Rachin made me laugh. I was taking the boys to the dining hall, when he approached me. You irritate me, you know. What about, Sir? A women's association has heard about your choir. It's president has written to me. The stupid women want to hear it. You are forever adding to my burdens. This recreational activity has not harmed discipline. This week, there was no running away. - Just luck. - I don't think so. Your ladies will be here at 3 pm. Where can we perform? In the dining hall. Congratulations! Simpering, music... Why not afternoon tea? You irritate me, you know. So long as that's the worst I can do. Insolence! So, at 3 o'clock... Bagot-the-music-stand became Bagot-the bouquet-presenter... walking calmly up to Madam President. I couldn't understand the mumbling, ' but I knew the intention. Thank you young sir! - Will you introduce us? - Over here. May I present Mr Clement Mathieu... our supervisor who has taught the boys to sing. Congratulations. We're following Mr Rachin's humain methods with great interest... and we are most grateful for your assistance to him. I'm more than happy to help such a sympathetic superior. So let's get on with the singing. Madame. Mr Rachin is obviously too modest to enjoy compliments. Quite! What are we going to hear? "La Nuit de Rameau", madam. Well, we'll listen to that. And that little boy who stands aside? Is he being punished? Who, ma'am? - Over there? - Yes. That one's on his own... because he is... our star. He has the best voice in the choir. He's a very good young lad... with an artistic intelligence that's beyond his age. That would amaze me. He has such a sweet face. The face of an angel. May I? In Laugier's eyes... I suddenly read a lot of things. Pride, he joy of being forgiven... and also, and this was new to him... recognition. Chapter 6. Peace has been declared between the boys and me. I've even a vague impression that I've gained their friendship. This budding friendship is often hidden behind rudeness and rough play... It's expressed in unexpected gestures... giving me a taste of joy that's sweet and deep. Our choir now has a harmonium! Guess who brought it to us from home. Mr. Langlois, who'll be our accompanist. It doesn't matter. We'll try again. April 12 Now it's the Easter holidays, and the weather is superb A beautiful azure sky looks down on the grim school buildings. I can the feel the boys dreaming of jumping the streams... of rolling joyfully in the grass and running across the fields through the flowers. This beautiful weather makes them sad. April 18 Easter Sunday. Maxence is well again. He came to lunch for the first time in the dining hall. When did he leave for Paris? Rachin? Last night. A bit of quiet, please! Finish your dessert and go on out into the yard. Poor kids... What sort of Easter holiday! Yes, he left with Langlois. Langlois is having the holiday in Paris? Take it, son. He should holiday with his family. Do you know what Rachin is doing in Paris? Maybe discussing the school finances with the board of directors. - No? - Yes. he would have gone to defend his progress... in the hope of a medal! The main thing is, he's not here right now! We're lords of the manor! That gives me an idea. A bit less noise... Go on outside. Really?! In Paris, Mr Rachin was not wasting time. During the visit of the management committee... the performance of the cantata had done much for him. He was jubilant. He was going to leave with a substantial promotion... and had a brief word with the chairman about his decoration. But knowing is one thing... Destiny is capricious. When a door opens... it can allow happiness to enter, but also doom. - Would you excuse me? - Certainly. Oh... Terrible catastrophe... Eaubonne Boarding School burned down after lightning strike. Numerous casualties feared. When Rachin arrived, the buildings were still burning. What had been dormitories, classrooms... were nothing more than burnt walls. An anxious crowd contemplated the disaster. No one had been saved. 60 poor boys were missing. The late arrival worried about their fate... About Maxence, of whom there was no sign... and the one who'd taught the children to sing. People started talking about them. 'We just removed a burnt skeleton It's terrible! ' For Rachin, it was his Legion d'Honneur that was burning. But his own accommodation was intact. He was almost consoled. What was happening all of a sudden? What got into Mr Rachin? What's going on? The crowd stood frozen... momentarily forgetting the calamity. Listen! On that beautiful Sunday, he had taken the children out. The jailer had opened the door of the cage for several hours. After lunch, I took the boys out... through the vegetable garden over to Ligneul. - 10km from here? - Yes. And no one ran away. I took them to the circus. To the circus? I'd heard the Circus Rancy was there... with the ventriloquist Piccolo. It was hilarious! Mr Maxence, I am most disappointed with you. But Sir... I take full responsibility for this outing, Sir. Mr Maxence tried hard to dissuade me. He came along only through fear of runaways. He did not participate in the outing. - Who paid for the circus? - I did. I shouldn't listen to you. Mr Maxence, your case is undecided. Considering that all the boys were saved... you will only get temporary suspension. Thank you, Sir. As for you, you are dismissed for disobeying the regulations. Correct me if I'm wrong, but... should I have obeyed the rules... and stayed to fry with 50 kids? Administratively speaking... yes. Wait... This is what's owing to you. Sign at the bottom, here. Organise your things. They're all burned. Leave immediately. You're forbidden to see any pupils. What?! - Mr Maxence, you see it happens. - Yes, Sir. May I tell you, with the administrative respect due to you... just what think of you. You're a malicious individual, and at the same time, a coward. Nice to get that off my chest. Leaving us, Mr Clement? Thank you for saying goodbye to the plague-carrier. That'll be a shame. - Where are the boys? - Up there. A classroom was set up in the attic of the gatehouse. - Who's looking after them? - Old Maxence. Please say goodbye to them for me. Goodbye, Marie. Goodbye, Mr Clement. - See you. - Sure. I had hoped that a student may have sneaked out to say goodbye. No one, alas. Their good sense struck me as indifference. What about Old Maxence? As I went out the last portal, a surprise awaited me. I recognised Dupin's careful writing. And this one with its errors was Bagot's. This one stained by inky fingers... with the masculine signature of Chounard. This and this... The class materialised before my eyes... to give these absent farewells. What would become of me? Each time that life has turned hard for me... I went to visit an old traditional Breton lady who I venerate. There, the calm and honest life brings me serenity and strength. The negatives diminish with a sad sweetness. The farewell of those children gives me reassurance. And despite my brutal dismissal... I have reason to have faith in those kids... and it was good for me to have loved them. The end. - It makes me want to cry. - I know where he is! I should have thought of it! He's at his old godmother's. - You know the address? - Raymond would have it. That's it! The potatoes will be beautiful. Right, I'm going to hoe them. Good day to you Sir. Good day to you. That's a funny-looking hoe. I'd like some potatoes. What do you want to do with the potatoes, Sir? For a friend's wedding dinner, Sir. Your friend is marrying, Sir? Yes, a man of letters, Sir, who writes literature. You think he'll get married? That amazes me. That amazes you? Just you wait... Does that amaze you? "The book which, by alerting the public authorities..." "has caused the suppression of a number of abuses." Goodness! 77 thousand.... Clement's doing alright for himself! "Death to Rachin. Rachin is a..." What? Better he doesn't know. That was the old headmaster. The kids have been weird the last few days. When I come near them, they go quiet. I don't like it... because I know them. - Is it because of the new head? - Not at all. - In the meantime? - The clock. can't you hear? Here's Maxence! - Hello, Mr Maxence. - Aren't you playing? We're just talking. You make sure you stay away from the burned buildings, OK? Go off and play! So is that agreed? Wait for Laugier. He's with the head. There he is! It's you who'll be putting the new methods into operation. Do yourself proud. Your aunt's coming for you tonight. You have 3 days off. Make sure you come back. I promise I will, thank you Sir. Off you go and enjoy yourself then. Haven't you heard anything about tonight? No Sir. I have a sharp ear, though. They've burgled my storeroom! They took all the chocolate and 3 packets of cookies. The rogues. It looks like Rachin may have been right. These little thugs need the stick. Headmaster, Sir, here's one of them! He was in a truck headed for Paris. This was in his pocket. My cookies! Is this how you reward us? Are you unhappy here? Speak. Do you have something to say? Only with my lawyer present. We get soft... we allow them some slack... and they take advantage! - Have we done you any wrong? - No, you haven't. So why on earth have you run away? Answer me! Put him in solitary. You can bring him to me when he's ready to talk. He won't let me go now. - You were supposed to be on leave? - Yes. He'd given me 3 days off to go to... Headmaster... Sir! I know where they are! I'm sure... I'm positive! Listen... Take a cookie. Come with me. This is very kind of you! - I'm not too late? - No. I applauded you the day before yesterday at the Opera. What a performance! Yes, I didn't sing too badly. I say... even ma-in-law's hat is tasteful. The day's been blessed! - You'll sing it in 'A'? - Yes.. The rhythm's wrong! What's going on?! Bagot's in tune. The day is certainly blessed! Subtitles by FatPlank for KG
