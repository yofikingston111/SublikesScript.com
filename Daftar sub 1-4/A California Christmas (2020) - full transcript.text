Joey! Hey... you. How'd you sleep? So good. Great. Okay, uh, checkout, it's at noon. Here's a little menu if you get hungry. And, uh... I'll call you. Hey! No you won't. Okay. Looking good as ever, Ms. D. Thank you, Mr. Van Aston. Good morning, sir. Good morning, sexy. How'd you sleep? Beautifully, as always. What's up? Thank you. -See you at the office, sir. -Sounds good! Good morning, ladies. How we doin'? Problem solved! Joseph will go. -Mom, absolutely not. -It's not up to you, son. Just send Leo! What? You can get the contract signed this week. Listen, it is not that simple, Joseph. They haven't signed the contract yet. The owner of the property, she's difficult. That's where you come in. This is a very important deal to Van Aston enterprises. We have tried everything to get this piece of land. Money and pressure don't seem to have any effect. We have three weeks to get this parcel in escrow. If not, the deal falls apart before Christmas. Fine. What do you want me to do? Well, as far as I can tell, you've got one skill. Getting young women to do whatever the hell you ask them to. You don't know anything about my personal life. This is your last chance to show me you're capable of, well, anything, really. And if I don't? Well, then, it all goes away. The title, the stipend, the hotel suite... and the Leo. You can't do that. Should you manage to pull this off, we will announce your move from managing partner, to president of acquisitions at the holiday party. You want to be a real part of this company? It starts here. Oh, voicemail. Thank God! Gemma. Hey, it's me. Listen, I've been thinking a lot, and I think it's pretty clear that we're not working, so, uh, I think we should call it quits. Yeah, but remember, you are a sensational woman that is going to make some man very happy some day. Stay beautiful. Wow, I really thought she was the one, sir. Shut up. Who lives out here, anyway? It's a whole lotta nothing. This is wine country. Did you know that 80% of the nation's wine is made right here in California? And Chardonnay grapes are the most popular ones planted. Actually-- All right, y'all. Here it comes. Come on. Shit! My apologies, sir! These roads could use some work. How far are we? Uh, just up the road here, sir. They're not expecting you until later today. Do you have any clothes I can wear? I can't show up like this. I picked these up at the Christmas Clothing Drive. I was going to donate them to Goodwill. Well, aren't you a little saint? Shut up. If money and power don't impress these people, maybe I should go with something a little more casual. Wow. Well, that will cut down on the small talk. Ah, screw it. So? What do you think? Well, you definitely nailed "casual," sir. All right. Get this car out of here, and I will call you when the deal is done. I could use a good cleaning. Good. You do that. But don't go too far, 'cause it's not gonna take long. What in the world? Hannah, where's the water? Come on, Hannah, I need that water. Coming, Callie. -Hey! -Oh, hi, new ranch hand. -Let me help you with that. -Oh, my gosh. Thank you. Good thing you got here early! A calf is coming! What? -Hannah, I need that water! -The new ranch hand has it! -Who? - No, no, no. -I'm not the new-- -Just set that down and come help me. Grab his feet. She stopped pushing. -I need to check her eyes. -Oh, my-- Oh... Grab it. Come on. Come on. Come on, girl. You've got this, okay? You can do it, okay? Come on. I need one more, all right? Come on, girl. You got this, okay? Pull! What are doing? -Pull! -I'm pulling! -Pull it harder! -Okay. Come on. You're okay. One more. You got it! Yes, you did it. You did it. Good girl, good girl. Good job. All right, let's get it out. Okay... You called it, Han. He's a boy. I'm gonna call him Joey. I think that's a perfect name. God, you know, for a second, there, I thought you were the suit. The what? Some hoity-toity company man, supposed to come by later today and wave some money in my face. -Is that so? - Yeah, but, uh... I'm ready to welcome him, though. I see that. Hey, Hannah, why don't you go tell mom we got a new addition to the ranch, okay? Get. Follow me. Sorry about your clever shirt. So what's your deal? Most ranch hands show up a day or two late, not the other way around. You know, this is some beautiful land you've got here. It's a, uh, it's a cow farm, right? You mean dairy farm? -Sure. -Yeah, we have cows, but it's just enough for some local production. Do you make a lot of money? Like most ranchers out here, we barely get by. Then why the heck do you do it? There's more to life than money. Yeah, but it doesn't suck, having money. I'm sorry. Okay, look. I'm not who you think I am. All right? No, my-- Oh, no. I know exactly who you are. You woke up one day and thought, "Hey. I'll learn how muck a stall, round up some cattle. I'll get a free bed to sleep in and then I'll charm my way through doing as little work as possible." You're working for trade housing with a little bit of stipend. If you're here for the money, you're in the wrong place. Are you coming? Name's Callie, by the way. Manny, is it? Uh... yeah. Your free bed. The, uh, key is inside. There's a list of projects that have been piling up. And the generator's down, so you might want to start with that. So what do you think? You up for it? Or do you want to go work somewhere else to make some big money? Yeah, I'm up for it. Okay. Day starts at 6:00 AM around here. One strike and you're out. Hannah, what are you doing up here? I'm sorry! I just wanted see if the new ranch hand wanted some breakfast! Cheese or jelly? -Oh, I'm more of a-- -You're not hungry, are you? No, no, of course not. Great. Meals are not included in this job. Hi, Manny. I'm Hannah. Hi. I'm, uh... I'm Manny. Your hands are really soft. Oh, it's, uh... it's lotion. You have a truck, right, Manny? No. Well, yes! Yeah, I mean, of course I got a truck. It's just, uh... it's getting-- it's getting fixed in the shop right now. Great. Tomorrow. 6:00 AM. Let's go. Be careful. Oh, dear God. All done, sir? Not quite. I'm gonna need a little more time. That's fine, sir. I could use a few more minutes myself. Listen, Leo, this girl, she is not what I expected. What did you expect, sir? I don't know. I just thought she'd be a... a girl. Did you tell her about the offer? Nope, definitely didn't do that. But I have a new plan. It just might take a little while. Are we talking a few more hours, or-- I'm saying a few more days. Look, no amount of money is gonna get this girl to sell. I need to get to know her a little better. You know, figure out what makes her tick. So we're staying in town? Yeah, yeah, would you get a hotel for the next few days. I need you close by on this one. Where are you gonna be? I will be here, pretending to be the new... ranch hand. I'm sure nothing will go wrong with that plan, sir. Oh, and I need you to find the guy that was supposed to come to work here tomorrow. What do we know about him? His name is Manny. Go on. That's all I know. You expect me to find a guy named Manny in a town that I've never been before? Yeah, and that he was supposed to start work here tomorrow. Sir, even if I find this Manny, what am I supposed to do with him? Just throw him some money so he doesn't show up here tomorrow, and, uh... Tell him someone else got the job. -Sir-- -All right, I gotta go. Sir! How am I supposed to find a guy named-- Manny! Oh, yeah, right, that's way too fast, Jerry. I still see a dirt spot right there. Excuse me. You wouldn't happen to be a ranch hand, would you? Are you a psychic? You know, you could have at least hired someone who looks like they know what they're doing. Have you seen him yet? He looks like he should be on a soap opera. Really? I saw a picture of him online... What website were you on? Mmm, I don't know. It seemed reputable. Mom! I... I'm kidding. He answered my ad. He seems fine, Cal. We've been managing just fine on our own. Callie, you cannot run this entire ranch all by yourself. Hey! I help! Oh! I-- I just think the two of you could use a little more muscle around here, no offense. Ooh, it's ready! Have you given any more thought to the Van Aston proposal? No. And I'm not going to. I told you I'd get another extension from the bank. We're fine. Mom, this land is not for the Van Aston Warehouses, or whatever the hell. It's for the Bernet Ranch, our home. Does that not mean anything to you? I just worry about... you being okay when I'm gone. Mom, stop. No... One for Luma Deli, and one for us! Hey, not too many, Hannah! Christmas is not for another two weeks! Oops. Well, I... I think they look fantastic. Mom, you want some? No, honey, I am... I'm gonna go get some rest. -But, mom, it's not bedti-- -Hannah. You think Manny would want some? I think Manny is very busy. So let me get this straight. You guys want me to disappear, and you're gonna pay me $3,000 to do it? Well, yes. Under one condition. Now that that's settled, do you know of any hotels around here? What? Do you know of any places to stay? Yeah, I know a place. Yeah, mom, I'm telling you, this is the only way to get through to her. No, I know it's stupid. You're the one telling me that this is the one skill I have, right? Yeah, I know, the Christmas party. It-- Oh, my gosh, come on. Mom, just give me a week. Okay? All right. Bye. Leo, pick... pick up your phone. You've reached Leo-- Where are you? Perfect. -Hi. -Hello. Your hair is growing in. Oh, hmm. You think so? It looks great. It's a little thinner than I remember. Just never thought I'd see the day it would reach past my ears. Give it a year our two, it'll be past your shoulders. Hey, have you seen the numbers from the deli? They're loving the Christmas theme, and they want to up their shipments to two times a week. Well... They're stuck with whatever an eight-year-old can produce. What if, um.... you helped your sister, and I upped the ante with the bakery, hmm? You let the ranch hand do the heavy lifting for a while. There's something off about him. And speaking of people I do not like... Mr. Van Aston is a no show. Oh... oh, I forgot to tell you, he emailed about having to reschedule. Well, whenever he does decide to show, -I'm ready for him. -Okay. -Woah! Woah... -Hello, Connor. Hello, Wendy. Sorry. Thought you were somebody else. Who were you expecting? Some big city slug who wants to buy our land. -Oh, I'm sorry. -Yeah. So what are you doing here? -I... I, uh... I thought you and I could try out the new wine bar over in Creston, maybe Saturday? Connor. What do you think I'm going to say to that? Maybe yes? You know we're just friends, right? I'll see you around. Don't shoot anybody today, okay? Hello? Hello! Hey, man! How are ya? Thank you so much for the sweet digs! And may I just say, uncanny. Unbelievable. -You must be Manny? -At your service, boss! How do you know who I-- I showed him your picture. I'm sorry if I missed your call. I didn't hear the phone ring. Yes, you did. And what is up with this place? It was either this or our new friend here was going to implode your plan. -Implode your plan. What exactly is your plan, sir? So I was fully prepared to give them the whole spiel, and then the next thing I know, I'm pulling a small cow out of a big cow's ass. Well, now what? Because I can't deal with that guy for too much longer. I think this can work in our favor. Think about it, I get her to trust me, she cries on my shoulder, all of that crap, and then I convince her to sell. Make it look like it's the best move for her family. You and I will handle the rest of the deal over the phone. All the while, her good friend Manny is helping her out. Come on! Then the Van Astons will send them a big fat check and I'm back on easy street. It's a perfect plan. And how do I fit into to this, sir? You just keep taking my mother's phone calls and make sure that that guy doesn't blow our cover. -Joseph, is that your-- -Yup. Tak'er for a spin! And buy me some work clothes, would you? Yes, I could use a break. -Manny. -Hey, boss man. Hey. So is Manny short for something? Yeah, Juan-Pablo Manuel Francisco Villanueva-Cortes. Great, "Manny" it is. Here you go, sir. Ranch clothes, as ordered. Thank you. So, uh, here's the deal. I need to look like I know what I'm doing -on a ranch. -Uh-huh. Can you help me with that? Well, it's a dairy farm, so it's pretty easy. Do I look like I know anything about a dairy farm? Just put my number on speed dial. -It'll be fine. -Okay. What's your number. That's the tricky part, isn't it? You're gonna have to pay me a little extra. And I would love the master bedroom. Fine. Come on... See if we can get a tune out of this trombone. Mom. Oh... - Hello? - Yes, sir. Hey, can you hear me? Is that cows mooing? Yes, those are cows, Leo. I'm on a frickin' cow farm. Put the ranch hand on He's not picking up his phone. Hold, please. Manny? Manny. Wake up, Manny. Manny! -Sir, he's not waking up-- -Good morning, sunshine. -What is wrong with you? Give me the phone. I got it. Hey, good morning, boss man. What can I do you for? Hey, okay, they gave me a list of jobs I'm supposed to do. I don't know what half this crap means. What is "muck the pens?" Yeah, how the heck do I "muck?" Oh, uh, yeah, that's easy. All you gotta do is shovel the cow-- What? Okay, Houston, I'm headed to the gulag. Here's-- behind you, behind you. Hey. Call of Duty or Halo? -Syrah or Noir? -Leo... I promise you, if you play Call of Duty with me, you can open my eyes to the world of Pino New-ear. It's "Noir." Gosh dang it. Okay, let's go again. Yes, sir. Hey, can you put the ranch hand on? I got my axe stuck in a stump. -Manny? -What? His axe is stuck in a stump. Hey, I got a question for ya. If you take a squat on a stump and take a dump, does it become a toilet-tree? -Oh, god. Yeah, that's funny. Okay, seriously. What do I do? All right, all you gotta do is kick the handle sideways, and, uh, that'll loosen it. All right, I'm gonna try it. Hold on. I got it. Hey, that worked. Thank you so much. -I appreciate it. -It worked! -Good! -Great. Joseph, do you really think this plan of yours in gonna work? Have you even spoken with your mother yet? Hadouken! I gotta go, sir. Good luck! Hello? It was worth it. You should see the other guy. Yes, I am aware that we are behind, sir, but you have my word we are good for it this month. Yes, I did. I did see the notice. But like I said, you have my word. What do we have left? Ooh, how does it feel? Ooh... how does it feel? No, no, no, no! Oh! -Yes! -Player two wins. A for effort, son. Oh, don't talk all proper, Leo, okay? No one likes a bragger. I won like three times before you. -Yes, sir. -Hey, put Manny on. -Manny, for you. -Hmm. -Yeah, boss. -Exactly how do you milk a cow? Oh, uh, milking a cow is easy-peasy. All you gotta do is pull down on the teats. Yeah, that's what I'm trying, but nothing is happening. Hannah! What's going on? - Boss? Hello? You have to roll it through your fingers. - No, I know, I was just gettin'-- Gettin' it nice and warmed up, you know? Now squeeze from the top as you pull down. Hey, I got the flow going. You don't look like your picture. Picture? What happened to your mustache? Mustache? I can't picture that. Yeah, I, uh, I got sick of it. I need your help with the Christmas breads. -Come on. - See ya around. Can we leave? Let's just get out of here, please. Let's go out and party. All right, I'm, like, suffocating in here. It smells like wine. Can't do that. Boss's orders. Fine, then we'll party here, then. Woah, woah, woah. Stop. -Mmm. -What are you doing? Lesson one, never drink out of a wine bottle like a heathen ever again. Walnut and cocoa bean. What did you say? Walnut and cocoa bean. How did you know that? Pretty easy, Leo. You can just taste it. It's like tasting an apple in apple juice. Gosh dang it. Hey, little guy. I'm not gonna hurt you. Strike one. I need you to come with me please. Okay. I just need the ladder to get the feed bags, please. Sure thing. Sorry. All right. They're all expired. Okay, I'll, uh, go into town tomorrow -and pick some up. -Great. So did you notice the feed bins were empty? What? The feed bins for the cows were empty. Meaning they haven't eaten today. Yeah, but that wasn't on my list, so... Okay, well, neither is "take a shower" but good hygiene is still expected on this ranch. Noted. All right, well, if you're good for the night, I have to go to work. Isn't this where you work? During the day. I'm a bartender at The Brew Pub six nights a week. When do you sleep? Sleep is overrated. Do you really enjoy that? Like, waking up super early. Going to bed super late. Is that-- is that fun for you? -What are you doing? - I don't know. I'm just trying to have a conversation with you. Well, don't. Okay. And, uh, that shouldn't be out here. Hello, you... You know, normally, chicks run towards me instead of away from me. I'm losing my touch. Okay, okay. You're... There you go. Now where in the heck did you get out? Leo, hey, it's me. I need your help. What do ranchers wear to a bar? Hey. What are you doing? Setting up. Ho ho ho! Hey. What's wrong? Did something happen with your mom? No, she's the same. But today would have been her last chemo treatment? One more try. That's all the doctor wanted. I'm sorry, Cal. Same is good, though, right? It doesn't change the outcome. Sometimes you gotta let the feelings in. They're not going to break you, I promise. Come here. Come here. Shut up and play me something. Can I get another beer, please. Okay. Hello. Hey. What are you going for? '80s rhinestone cowboy? Well, uh, Stallone and Dolly totally had it goin' on, so yeah. You know the movie? It's actually, uh, my favorite. Can I get you anything? Do you guys have, like, a Callie Special or something? I do, but not for people who have to be up by 6:00 am. I'll take my chances. Okay... One Petaluma Slamma coming up. What are you doing? I thought I told you to stay in the truck. I wanted to see what all the hubbub was about, plus I got dressed up. I approve. There's an entire seat between us. Everything is fine. -I told you-- -And here you go. Don't say I didn't warn you. Excuse me, ma'am. Is there a corkage fee? -Don't worry about it. -Much obliged. Don't look at me! You know, you never thanked me for finding our friend-- Manny! -What is goin' on? -This isn't gonna be good. -What are you doing here? -What are you doing here? Leo, I told you, I needed to get out of there, okay? All right? I'm a dragon, and you need to let me fly. Callie Bernet, who is working behind the bar, is the one who hired "Manny." And the other "Manny" is also here. -You have to leave, now. -I'm so sorry. -No, I had no idea. -What are you doing? Uh, hey, me... - Yeah, okay, look. I'll pay you more money, but you gotta go right now. - Hey, Manny! -Connor! -What's up, buddy. -Hey, good to see you. Who are your friends? Uh, well, this Prince-looking guy is Leo, and, uh, this... is... also Manny. -Another Manny? -Yup. -No way? -Mm-hmm. Guys... nice outfits. Thank you very much. Manny here works at the Bernet ranch-- -Hmm? -Huh? Uh, shoot. I just realized that I'm drunk already. -You can't smell it? -I'll give you a ride. -Thank you, thank you. - All right. -Bye, gentleman. -Nice meeting you. Whatever, bro. See you. Why haven't you answered your phone? Well, Connor, I'm a little busy, if you can't tell. What if I come over tonight and change your mind? Really? Connor, my answer is still no. You're so drunk. Go home. Go on. I told Liam that I would take care of you. You think this is taking care of me? Let go. She said let go. What are you gonna do about it? You know, I've always wanted to do this... Ouch. I saw that going differently in my head. Enough! Knock this shit off right now unless you both want a piece of this? Both of you. Out. -Callie, I-- -I said get out. Look, I don't know you that well, but you don't deserve that. -Give me something. -Uh... woo! Let's give it up for testosterone! A one, a two, a one, two, three, four... Hey, where's Manny? He's heading back to the rental property. What happened to you? Just some small town loser. Were you saving a damsel in distress? Turns out, the damsel doesn't need saving. I see. Hey, mom. Hi. Here you go. -Thank you, baby. -Yeah. How about I take the day off today? Really? -Hey. -Hey. -Here you go. -Is this for me? Yeah. Mmm. Oh, it's good. I know it's a mess in here, isn't it? I can't bring myself to clean up the place. It was my dad's workshop. -Oh, yeah? -Yeah. Go ahead. Oh, my gosh. Are you kidding me? -What is this, a panhead? -Yeah. Oh... That's insane. Is this a rebuild? -Started with the engine. -Wow. It was my dad's. He, uh, he died three years ago. -Oh, I'm sorry. -It's okay. You know, my-my dad passed away when I was young. I wish I could say it gets easier, but, uh... I guess you just-- you get used to it. Yeah. Last night at the bar, I shouldn't have got so upset. I know you were just trying to help. Connor, he's... he's harmless, really. He's just messy. And strong. Does it hurt? Uh, no. Looks worse than it is. -Gummys or long stripes? -Long stripe, please. -Thank you. -Uh, gummys. -What's a long stripe? -What? These things made my childhood! Here, try some. Here you go. -Just take it off the thing? -Yeah. -Oh, that's pretty good? -Right? -Hey, Hannah? -Hmm. What is this down here? -Are you ticklish? -No! -Ow! -Hannah, are you okay? -I-I didn't mean to. -Hannah, are you okay? -I-I didn't even touch her. -çscreaming] Oh, come on! That was mean. Stop! Stop! Okay, okay, okay, okay. Okay. How about some real food? Thank you. Dear Jesus, thank you for this food. Thank you for Mama. Make her better! We'd really appreciate it. Thank you for our house. Bless the food to our body. Oh! And thank you for bringing Manny here to help us. -Amen. -Amen! Amen. Please let me clear the table. -Thank you. -Thank you. Of course. And I will try not to ruin the dishes. Oh! I'm sorry. You forgot your hat. Thank you. -Aaw... -Hannah. Clear the rest of the dishes. Goodnight! Wow. Hey... Thank you. For what? Well, the last couple years have been really, pretty tough around here. Especially for Callie. I don't know, that girl that just skipped out of here, it's like... it's like I got my girl back. And I think you might have something to do with that. -No. No, I... -Hey. You got a job for the spring? Well, good. Don't go anywhere, then, okay? -Okay. -Oh, and, um-- sorry. Uh, please be careful with her. Her heart, I mean. She's not as tough as she looks. -Yes, ma'am. -All right. Joseph, stop avoiding my calls! I demand an update. Your deadline is up. If you cannot get that signature, I will have to come up there and get it myself. And I think you know what that means. More baked goods from the ranch? They need the money. I thought this could help them out. You do realize you have the power to give them more money than they'll know what to do with, right? How much longer are we gonna do this? I have to update your mother. It's been over a week, Joseph. I know. Pass me the blend, lover boy. Lover boy? I wasn't born yesterday. I can see it all over your face. -Shut up. -Oh, yeah. Hey, you really care about this girl, right? You gotta tell her. The longer you wait, the worse it's gonna get. Okay? Watch this! -No, no, I don't want to-- -Stop. -No, Leo. -Stop. Have you ever tasted this wine before? No. Watch. Vanilla. Cherries. Nectarine. Aged oak? -Bullseye! -Mmm! -What? -That is Manny's superpower. To the best mentor I ever had. Senor Leo. -Wow, Senor Leo. -Senor. Are you expecting company, sir? No. I'll go check it out. Look, in the contract, it doesn't mean anything. I swear, we can rip it up right now. I know you must think that I am a terrible person, and you'll probably never talk to me again, but I thought you should know the truth. Damn it. Hey. You know, my mom and I had our second picnic lunch this week. We haven't done that in years. Thank you. You've really been pulling your weight around here. You sure about that? I'm not charming my way into doing as little work as possible? I wanna show you something. This is my favorite part of the property. Wow. These vines are the oldest things on the entire ranch. My great, great, great grandfather brought them home from France in a suitcase. What? Somehow they survived, and viola. My dad wanted to turn the ranch into a winery one day. He really believed in it. -Wow. -The wine's pretty good too. -Really? -Yeah. I brought a few up here just in case. Do you sell this stuff in town, too? No. We, uh... We just give it to friends for gifts and things. But we do drink a fair amount of it ourselves. Wow. That's actually really good. Yeah. What's going on? I just don't know how much time we have left here. What are you talking about? We've been drowning in debt for months. And I don't see a way out. I can't tell you how helpless I feel. Some big city company wants to buy our land for a shipping facility. Yeah, but you could-- you could take the money and buy an even better ranch, you know? It's not about the money. It's this land. Every single one of my memories with my mom and dad are from here. Pretty soon, this place will be all I have left of both of them. I know there's a way out. I know there is. I just... I haven't figured it out yet. What's this? Liam. My fiancé. He was with my dad when he crashed. We were going to buy Christmas lights. We? Oh, my gosh, Callie, I am so sorry. They were gone so fast. In the blink of an eye. And now with my mom ending her chemo early, she said it was worse than dying. She's fading so slowly. I don't... I don't know which one is worse. But I bet heaven looks just like this. Except on Christmas, the hills are covered in snow. I've never seen it, you know. Snow? -Yeah. -What? It doesn't snow around here, and I haven't really had the chance to leave. Callie, I, uh.... What is it? I, uh... I should probably go see who that is. Yeah. Connor? Can I help you? I was just driving around the area, thought I'd come by. You've got to stop "coming by." -I'm not interested-- -It's Manny, isn't it? I forgot, you two have already met. You know my friend Manny, right? You two work together on another ranch or something together? It's so odd. Two Mannys in this tiny little town. Have you seen my friend Manny? -'Cause I-- -Look, I don't-- I don't want any trouble. All right? So why don't we start that introduction over. -Shall we? -Connor. Hey. Look at me. Hey, Liam would hate to see you like this. I'd like you to leave now, please. I'm sorry. He's... he's had a hard couple of years. I mean, we all have around here. He was a good friend of Liam's. The whole town was. Liam sounds like he was an awesome guy. Yeah, he was. Keep this. Maybe we can finish it later. Leo, hey. I have to tell Callie the truth. The deal is supposed to close tomorrow. Have you spoken to your mother? Almost. And by almost, you mean... I mean, I didn't, okay? Sir. I can't do this Leo. I won't-- I won't do this to her. Well, now what? -Hey. -Hey. What's up? Can I talk to you about something? What? -I'm sorry. -What is it? -You have something... -What? On your... on your nose. -Did I get it? -No. Okay, wait, wait. I'll get it. Here. What did you wanna say? Just... Pastrami or... peanut butter? Um, pastrami. Peanut butter. Can you help me make 'em? I can't reach the peanut butter. Where's mom? She's still sleeping. Actually Han, uh... Manny was just saying he needs help feeding the calf. Do you think you can help him really quick before lunch? Sure. Mom? Mom. No, no, no, no. God, please. Come on, come on. Hey! Hey. Are you okay? Come here. Mom, come on. Mom... Mom. Help! Help, help! Somebody help! Hey, can you finish up here? I'm gonna go check on your sister. Sure. -Come on. Hey! Let's get her to the truck. Come on. It's all right. It's okay. Thank you very much. Okay. -Oh! -Thank you. Just a dress rehearsal, I guess. Mom, stop. It was a hiccup, okay? Are you positive you don't want to try the chemo once more? Mom, the doctor said trying one more time could give your lungs a few more years. -No. -And it-- If this happens again without me close by, I... Sh-sh-sh. Oh, baby. You have that same fight in you that your father had. And I love you for it. But this is a battle you can't win, Callie. How do you know we can't win if you don't try one last time? Baby, those treatments, they... they just keep me sick and asleep in a dark room all day, away from you girls. You think that's how I want to spend my last days? -As if I've already left? -No. I just... I can't imagine life without you in it, mom. Oh, baby. Hey, hey... Sh-sh-sh... you have to deal-- You have to deal with what is, Callie, not what you want the world to be. Are you scared? Of course I am. But don't think I'm gonna let that fear rob me of a second of happiness with you girls. Let's go home. I want to go home. What would you do, dad? Hey. -Hey. -What's going on? What time does your shift start? I have to leave in 30 minutes. Why? Manny! What are you doing! -Promise you won't look. -I promise. Okay. I haven't heard that sound in forever. yeah, well, I thought I'd fix her up, Just in case you ever wanted to, you know-- It's amazing. Are you serious? Hey, thank you for today. For keeping an eye on Hannah. She's really taken a liking to you. And thank you for this. You have no idea how much I needed it. So I'll pick you up from work? Maybe we can finish that bottle of wine. See you soon then. Okay. No way. -The ranch hand? -Yeah. Look at your face! Oh! You got it bad! Stop. I can still taste those tangy tannins from last night's Sauvignon Blanc. Man, that was epic. Not as epic as our sick victory as we rolled those total noobs. Truth. Leo here. Yes, ma'am. Uh, no, no. I look forward to seeing you. Okay. Thank you. -Mrs. Van Aston's coming. -Oh, shit. We gotta tell Joseph. Let's go. -Yeah. -Thank you. Thank you. Is that-- -You look good. -Thanks. Are you serious? You better know how to 2-step. I learned all my moves from Stallone. Hey! Come on. Why isn't he answering his phone? I sent him 18 texts. Leo. We've looked everywhere. -Where could he be? Mrs. Van Aston. Yes. Yes, no, Joseph is back at the ranch. Everything's under control. Yes, yes, yes. Thank you. Let's go. Crazy idea, I'll try his phone again. What am I doing with my life? Man... The last time I was all the way out here, -I was with my dad. -Really? He said the stars were brighter at the edge of the property. And, uh, that old dairy barn, that was his last unfinished project. He said he was gonna turn it into something magical one day. -What's this scar from? -A jigsaw. -Got 13 stitches. -Ouch. What happened? Um... Growing up, I, uh... didn't really get to see my Dad all that much. It was usually every other weekend, and he was working on some engine. I remember one summer, we completely rebuilt the garage. I'm talking like a-- It was a tool bench, and raised racks, and we did the whole-the whole thing. It was awesome. I loved being around my dad. Loved watching him work. The crazy thing is I... can't really remember his face, or his-or his eyes. But his hands. I could never forget his hands. They were so strong... worn... reliable. I've been thinking about him a lot lately. Hey, Callie, I... Callie? -Connor. -I know. I knew there was something off about him. -Callie, I-- -Sir, she's here. -Hey, stop. -Dear God, Joseph. Why are you dressed like that? You can't take away their home. Well, you couldn't, apparently. But rest assured, I can. No, no, you can't. That's the thing. Not with all your money, and all your lawyers. There's nothing you can do to get them to bow down to you. All right, they've shown me that this past week. This isn't just a piece of land to them. They have a connection to this place that you will never understand. You've been lying to me this whole time? I knew it. That's what this is? You've been livin' on the ranch all this time, playing house with the farmer's daughter? You are a mess, Joseph. I don't care what you think I am. I'm not gonna let you do this. You can't stop me. This is the running total of the cost for your mother's past medical care. It is quite large, and it has gone to collection. Mom? Oh, well, there's more than enough in my life insurance to cover this. It's nothing for you to worry about, honey. That would have been true had your husband not taken a loan against it five years ago. The Bernet Ranch Winery? Sound familiar? It can't be. We are going to increase our offer for your property by the amount on that paper. Your bill will go away, as will all of your troubles. Mom, Mom... we can cover this. We've been keeping this ranch afloat all these years by the skin of our teeth. We can't do it anymore. You can't do it anymore. Either we accept this offer or the bank is going to seize the property. Now, there will be a fourteen day escrow. Your move out date will be January 6th. I can have the best movers come down here and help. That's so nice. But I signed the property over to my daughter last year, so you'll have to get her to sign. We will look over the contract and get back to you. You have 24 hours, dear. This is the best choice and you know it. Don't let your pride get in the way -of a smart decision. -Yeah. I'll see you to the door. Ah, baby, come here. Come here. Callie... Callie, wait. -Callie, I'm sorry. -What's your real name again? If you're going to call me Callie, I would love to know what I should call you. -Joe? JJ? -It's Joseph. Did you have a nice time here, Joseph? -Slumming it with us? -Callie, I wasn't sl-- Look, everything between us, everything I've felt for you, it was real. I'd love to believe that. But the only I know for sure right now, is that you're a great liar. I only lied about my name. You lied about who you are. Callie, I had no idea who I was... until I met you. Now, look, I can fix this. I just need-- I don't need a knight in shining armor to rescue me. Get the hell off my property. Callie, please don't do this. I'm sorry to hear about the girl, man. You never know. She might come around. Not this girl. Are you sleeping in your truck? You know that there's a set up with a trailer? No, I'm sad to say this, man, but it looks like they're gonna sell. This is just until I find another ranch with some trade housing. How are you gonna play all your games? I don't know. Here. I want you to have this. For your games. And, uh, Manny, I want to thank you for everything. Yeah, I guess I'll miss you, too. Look, no big deal. I'm coming in. -Take it. -Yep. -Take it. -Yeah. -You feel that? -It's weird. Yeah. Weird's good. -What? -I just can't choose one. There's a lot of great wines up here. Well, you might as well add this to your collection. What's this? There's a small vineyard on the Bernet ranch. -That looks interesting. Yeah, they-they brew it there, I guess. You don't brew wine, Joseph. -It ferments. -Idiot. Well, that's what I meant. Whoa. Oh, sorry, it must have turned. Gosh, how did I screw this up so badly? -It's not that bad. -Not that bad? Leo, I finally found a girl that I care about and I blew it. Let me see that. That's really good. Are you guys even listening to me? Did they make this on that ranch? Yeah. This is the greatest wine I've ever tasted. What is that? Lavender? Does she sell this? No, they just gift it to friends and family. They should. They'd make a killing. What? There it is. There it is, yes. -Bye. -Bye. Oh, Dad... Turn around. I said turn around! Listen to me, if I hit you, I won't be able to stop, and I can't do that. Because for some reason, Callie made me promise to leave you in once piece, so do us both a favor. Get back in the car, turn around, and don't come back. I can't do that. What? What could you possibly have left to say? You've done enough! She doesn't need this. She doesn't. And that is exactly why I am here. So come on, man, just let me make it right. And then, if you want to kill me, fine. Kill me. We both know I deserve it. Connor, we want the same thing. Yeah, and what's that? Callie's happiness. I might have a way to give some of it back. I thought I saw someone working up here. I told you to get off my property. Please tell me that you haven't signed the contract yet. What do you think? I just... could you put the shotgun down and hear me out? I have an idea that might help you save the ranch. Fine. In the late 1800s, there was a parasite called phylloxera that wiped out some of the most prestigious of wineries -in all of Bordeaux, France. -What are you talking about? But, a few years before the parasite hit, immigrants from France brought grape vines over in suitcases, to plant them in the rich soils of Northern California, creating years of coveted legacy in every single grape. Gosh, don't you get it, Cal? Your dad was right. These grapes, the wine, they could save your ranch. Now, I know a guy, and he can come out here, he can sample the wine, and he'll tell you -what the grapes are worth. -There it is. The knight in shining armor coming back to save the day -after all. -Not exactly. I told him the grapes were well taken care of. This is it. This is the barrel room. French oak. -May I? -Of course. Oh! On behalf of the Barrel Room Wine Club, we are interested in leasing your vines on limited distribution. Okay... We'd be happy to take your current inventory tomorrow. If you agree on the price, we can bring the lease agreement upon pickup. It looks like you've got around... 40 cases. And several full French oak barrels, so... My number's on the bottom. If you're happy with the price, give me a call. Oh, and the monthly lease payment, plus your commission on the sales should be around at least half of that each month. What do you think, Ms. Bernet? Mom. What? -We did it. -What's this? Oh, my gosh! Oh, honey! Oh, my gosh! Oh! Oh, I'm so proud of you. I love you so much. No way. That's the latest system. Special limited edition. Oh... oh. Okay. Don't get emotional. Look, I'm sorry, mom, but this was the right thing to do. I know it's bad for business, bad for the company, but I had to do it. I just-- I've never seen you so passionate about, -well, anything... -There's nothing you can say -to convince me otherwise-- -Joseph... -Because I finally understand-- -Joseph! I'm actually proud of you. Mom? For what it's worth, the position is still yours if you want it. Thanks, but... I think I'm good. Okay, do you how many guests we have on the list? Because last year we didn't have enough brownies, and it was-- What is going on here? -Nothing. -Nothing. Well, we just... We just thought maybe we'd have the Christmas party in the old-- in the old dairy barn this year. Are you kidding me? That place is a wreck. Tell me right now. Well... why don't we just show you? Go on. Mom! Oh, it's so magical, isn't it? I don't know what to say. How-how did you do this? I didn't. I helped a little bit. Give him a chance, okay? Oh, my goodness. Clever shirt. -Saves on the small talk. -Yeah. Okay, until you get your shotgun, I think I have at least a few minutes. Better make it good then. All right, um, listen, Callie, I-I want you to know, the entire time that I was working for you, it sucked. It was the absolute worst. You know, I-I was cold, I was tired, and I smelled like a cow's ass the entire time. Yeah, I remember that part. But it was the best time of my life. And I'd give anything to go back to that. Well, your position has been filled. Yeah, we got a new ranch hand. He's good, too. Experienced. Okay. But... I might be able to figure out something for you to do. Well, I would need meals this time. Oh, yeah. No. Meals are not usually included. And I would need a place to sleep. I think I can swing that. And you. That was so sweet. That was... So sweet. I thought you were long overdue.
