LJUBLJANA 2008. SLOVENIA PRESIDES OVER THE EUROPEAN UNION. Directed by Damjan Kozole SLOVENIAN GIRL This is room 410, the gentleman had a stroke, a heart attack... Something. Call an ambulance, please. As soon as possible. Thank you. Wake him up... Do something! It took me an hour today to get from Preseren Street to the central station. I took some Dane to the airport. The entire downtown was closed to traffic, did you see that? Unbelievable, one hour for a few hundred meters. Complete chaos. It's no good, if you ask me, this EU - it just costs us a lot of money. All right. -And here's another 200. Anything else? I've got something to tell you. OK? - What? Just promise you won't tell anybody. I promise. - I bought a flat, a new one. What do you mean? How could you buy a flat? An opportunity cropped up. The Housing Stock offered flats for sale and I took a loan. Why are you staring at me? Sorry, I am in shock. It's on Mesarska Street, in that new block. Awesome. Did your dad chip in? - How could he? He hasn't got anything. Then how could you raise that much cash? I told you. I took a loan. - And how are you paying it off? - With student jobs. Oh, come on, student jobs! You're messing with me. Here you are. Thanks. -You're welcome. So, how's life in Ljubljana? - OK. That's all you ever say. As if nothing worth mentioning ever happens. I passed the exam. - Congratulations, that's my girl. Listen, have you heard about that German that got killed? What German? I thought you'd know more since you live there. Come on, eat before it gets cold. Yes, here it is - A German member of the European Parliament found dead in a hotel room. A call girl had visited him just minutes before he died. Imagine - a call girl who goes by the name Slovenian Girl.. The Police are trying to find her to get some answers. It's all here in the paper. I'm running late, you know. Wait, let me give you some money. It's enough for the rent, but there's isn't much extra. For some chewing gum, maybe. - Thanks. Gotta rush, bye. Take care. And stay a good girl. Bye! Fuck off! What do you want? How did you know I was coming? I spoke to your old man. - Leave my father alone. I meant no harm. I just asked him about you, because I haven't heard from you lately. You don't return my calls or answer messages. What's going on? What do you want? You don't get it, do you? What? - Nothing! You'll get your money back, don't worry. Are you seeing someone else? - No. Honestly? - Now stop pestering me. I thought you had fallen for some guy from the University. Want a cigarette? What do you want? I've decided to divorce Polona. I've already told her. Don't divorce her because of me. I'm serious, Greg. It makes no sense. We're like yin and yang, remember? What yin-yang? Cut it out. Come on, I've got to study for my exams and work on my diploma paper. I have no time for anything else. Let me give you a ride. - No, thanks. Come on, I just offered you a ride, nothing else. No. I like to walk. And please, don't wait for me at the University any more. Last year I was so nervous at the exam that I threw up. Really? - Yeah, I remember that. So, this year I try my best to attend his classes regularly. Well, if you're lucky and he has a good day... So I need two of his good days in a row. One to persuade him to let me take the exam, and the other to pass it. Would it be possible for me to take the exam tomorrow? I can come anytime you say. Listen, you didn't show up last time. It's not that simple. I've studied thoroughly, I've read all the notes and everything... I had some problems... - We all have problems. I know, but I was... Alexandra, what is it? I've always liked you but you know that I don't make exceptions. I know, but I was through a lot lately. Can you be a little more specific? -I was ill. I see. What did you have? A tumor. A tumor? -Yes. What... what kind of tumor? Hi! I had it removed surgically. Are you going to be OK now, I mean, was it successful? I hope so. OK, I'll check my calendar and see when you can come. Some time next week, all right? - Thank you. Take care of yourself. What do you want? -I see you've been spending again instead of thinking about paying your debts. -Let me go, this is heavy. -Let me help you. - No, thanks. I moved out. - Isn't she pregnant? You're a real pig. How can you afford such a vase? You used to be so short you couldn't buy cigarettes. You're a jerk. Grab the door. Can I come upstairs? Ciao! This is it? -Yes. Here, this is for you. -Thanks. - May I? -Sure. It's wet outside. I can't believe it. It's nice, isn't it? Wow, this is... I'm speechless. Is there another room? - Yes, a bedroom. Anything else? - And a bathroom. Well, it's been established that a representative to the European Parliament Helmut Buder had died of natural causes. The autopsy has confirmed the cause of death was cardiac arrest. That has already been reported. What about a mysterious girl who was with him, the Slovenian Girl? Tell me when our police have managed to trace anybody? No comment. - Meaning that you still have not found the girl who called the police? The investigation continues and we shall do our best... No, this is not a good time. I have lectures. In a couple of hours would be better. I see... OK. I'll be there in no time. Do you work alone or with some other girl, maybe? Alone, and just occasionally. Are you new to this business? You shouldn't be asking such questions. It took me a while to find your number among the ads, that's why... -l've changed the number, so what? Just give me the money. - You'll get it, don't worry. Let's have a talk first. What do you want to talk about? Business. -What business? Who's that? - Relax. It's not the police. Hi. -Hi. Traffic in the city is a mess. Ah, pretty girl. Hi, l'm Peter. Just give me the money. We have a business a proposal for you. Won't you sit down? - No thanks. Look, you're a great girl, good looking and smart. Listen, just pay me and that's it. Wait, you'll get your money. Let's talk some sense. - You can't work on your own. It doesn't work that way. A lot of girls like you work for us. Listen, let's talk sense. -Just let me go. I wanna go home. Let me go, please. -Where do you live? -It doesn't matter. Please, don't let me fall, I beg you! Do you want us to drop you? Would you like that? To fly like a bird? Will you obey us and do what you're told? Iwill, lwill. -Say it. lwill do whatever you tell me to do. I will do whatever l'm told to do. Repeat it! I will do whatever l'm told to do! Louder! I will do whatever l'm told to do. Should we pull you up now? - Yes. OK, give me your hand. Pete, let's pull her up. Calm down, everything will be fine. Do you hear me? Fuck, you're idiots. Do we have a deal? Calm down. Don't you think we know that the police are after you? We've been following your ads in the paper. Do you want us to give you away to the police? You'll be in all the papers, your face on all the front pages. Can you imagine that? The Slovenian Girl. What's your name? Tina. Are you lying? Shit, it won't work... come on, you're an electrician. - Just switch it on. This is the grounding... Goddamn it, man. You almost killed me! You scared the hell out of me. - I got shocked. Are you OK? - Yeah. I got a shock. "Electroshock!" Now, let's visit your flat. Yeah, and they lost the match. - But it wasn't their fault. Where now, straight ahead? To the right. You'll be better off now. You can't work alone, you need protection. You'll see it's better that way. We're a serious company. We have many clients. Help! Help me! Call the police! Help! Are you looking for someone? - No, no. Don't bother, sir. We were looking for someone and got lost, obviously. Come on, Pete, let's go. Goddamn it, Vesna, where are you? Hello? Hi, Greg, it's me. How are you doing? As if you really cared how I was doing. I know. Listen, Greg... I'm sorry for what happened last time. I mean, I'm really sorry for everything. Please, I need help. I knew it wasn't a courtesy call. You're unbelievable... I'm too scared to go home, this whole situation is a complete mess. The mess is in your head. And for some time now. Do you take me for such an idiot you can call whenever you need something? Please, take me in... just for tonight. You said you lived alone, didn't you? What do you want from me? Greg, please help me out. I beg you! You ruined my life and you expect me to help you? Please, I have no one else and I don't know what to do. Come on, stop crying. What's wrong with you? Where are you? What's going on? - Let's go, quickly. Drive off! What's with you? -Just go, just go. Just drive, goddamn it! What happened? Nothing. Listen, I don't get it. First, you call, and then... There's nothing to understand. What's going on? What's with you? What do you think? We missed the boat? And one for me, please. What about Joe Cocker and guys like him? Or Bob Dylon? -lt's Dylan. Listen, they were talented... Oh, and we weren't, huh? We had the best equipment. Fender... -True. We were the best band in Krsko. If punk hadn't conquered the scene we'd still be gigging all around. Fucking punk. I say, let's give it a try. Hey, Slovenian Girl, aren't you going to say hello? You fucked me over. You'll see, now I'm going to fuck you over. When I get my hands on you, you little bitch. Do you think you can hide from me? You'll see, you rotten cunt. I'll lock you in a cellar, just like that Austrian guy did. What are you doing here? - Nothing. I came home. Come on in then. I've noticed you have two cell phones. So what? Some people have three or even more. Why should they have three phones? What for? I don't get it. Because they need them. For different reasons. What reasons? Why would someone need three cell phones? Isn't one enough? Cell phones are cheap now. All right, but think of all that radiation... I don't understand why. There's so much you don't understand. Hell, I don't. OK, you're obviously not going to tell me anything. So, I'll tell you something. - OK, go ahead. Light yourself a cigarette. Are you ill? -No. We've started practicing again. Electroshock is planning a comeback. If you don't mind or feel embarrassed about it. What is it? - Nothing. Did I say something? Super. Stop! Hi, honey, did you sleep well? The entire neighbourhood can hear your playing. Of course, we're practising. What? Do we suck? I'm off to see mom. You smoke? A lot? Like a chimney. Come inside. Come inside. - I'm not going inside. I don't want to share in your happiness. Why did you come then? - Can you lend me some money? How much? - A couple thousand. Are you crazy? Why do you need all that? - I just need it. What makes you think I have it? You think it rains money here? I didn't come here to listen to your lectures. I get too many of them in Ljubljana. Why on earth did you get involved with Edo? If I hadn't then you would have never been born. Maybe it would have been better that way. I gave you life, you should show me at least some gratitude. Yeah, right. I should be grateful to you because you had careless sex. - Watch your tongue! I hope I never become like her. That's all I wish. She's an ambitious greedy bitch. Why did you see her at all? To let her know l'm still alive. I'm so ashamed of my mother. Are you cold? -Yeah. Goddamn the anti-smoking act. lt'll ruin my child. Go home. It's not that bad. Hi, Edo. -Oh, Zdravc. - Hi, Sasha. -Hi. Well, is there gonna be a rehearsal or what? -Sure. What's going on? Nothing. I'm going home. What's wrong? - She's cold. Your daughter is a good chick, you know. It's kind of inappropriate for you to make such a comment. She could just as well be your daughter. Hey, that's not what I meant. - What did you mean, then? Nothing degrading. That she's a real fighter. - She is. Sasha. Wake up. Sasha, wake up. You'll miss the train. Come on. You need to go back to Ljubljana. -Not today. What do you mean? I'll stay here one more day... - You said you had an exam. Should we go out for a smoke? -Sure. Would you like to go to the movies with me sometime? Do people still do that? - Well, here they do. We're not quite up with the times. I don't know how things are elsewhere. Anyway, what do you want from me? Already when we were in elementary school I was building up courage to ask you to the movies. And why didn't you? You always liked older guys. The cool dudes. What are you trying to say? Nothing. I just want to talk to someone. I know. l'm sorry. Will we see each other again? I don't know. I've got a lot to study, I don't have the time. I need to be by myself. L'm doing my best. Do you know how much money that is? At least give me five days, if you can't give me seven. I think I could pay in five days. Look, this is how much you have to pay, including penalty interest. OK... What if you granted me another loan, a short-term one to pay off this one. Would that be possible? -Are you serious? You'll get yourself in trouble. Your monthly installment totals 800 Euros per month. This is not a small amount for a student. L've mortgaged the flat. - But you've mortgaged it to get this loan. Do you understand that? Look, until now We always paid on time. I can be late once, can't I? -You've signed a contract with the bank, not with me and it's not up to me to decide. Mortgages are dangerous. -Can you at least give me a couple of days? How many days? - Five days. Please, I beg you. OK, l'll postpone the payment, but please, don't fail me or we're both going to have serious problems. I won't fail you. - And pay as soon as possible. I will. Thank you very much. A 23-year-old student offers all sorts of services, also in English, top-level, discrete. Can you speak louder, Miss? I can't understand you. A 23-year-old student offers all sorts of services, also in English, discrete, top-level. Anything else? -What else? - Your advertisement code name? Oh, yes: Naive.. -Thank you, that would be all. -Thank you. You know, when l'm behind the wheel, I often think about stepping on the gas and turning left to crash into some truck. When l'm on some high balcony I think about jumping over the rail. Me too. L'm afraid of myself, you know. You jump off the edge and you're gone. All that's left of you is a pancake. What? -A pancake. If it wasn't for my little girl I would have done it, l'm sure. You know what? Death fascinates me much more than life. I think of death every day. But I don't want to hurt ,my little girl. She loves me, you know. And all the complications she would have with the funeral. And expenses. It costs a fortune. Yes, l'm down here, in front of the door. OK. Hi. -Hello. Are you coming in? If you want me to. Come on in. Take off your shoes so you don't bring bacteria inside. OK. Are you clean? - Of course. You say you're naive. No, that's just a code name. You're not naive, you're scared. L'm not afraid. Oh, but you are. Take off your stockings and panties. Sit down. 200 Euros? You're expensive. You'll see l'm worth it. Let's see. Hi. How are you? -Fine. Coffee with milk. -Right away. This won't do. You haven't studied at all. I have, but... -Not enough. I don't know... What's going on with you, Alexandra? I have to pass this exam. I have this terrible headache. Please. My dad will... I don't know what he'll do if I don't pass. Please. -What are you doing? Wait. Calm down, Alexandra, you can't do this. Try to understand me, please. -I do understand, but... I knew enough to pass, didn't I? Yes, it wasn't that bad. Fine. Let it be. Hi. I passed the exam. - Well done, great. That's my girl. Sasha, are you coming home today? -I have some errands, but l'll come tomorrow. OK, OK. l'll call Mrs. Bonaventura. Stop getting on my nerves. I don't believe it. I really don't. You can't trust people nowadays, especially not people like him. That's what I'm telling you. Forget the police. What are you having for dinner? Good, good. L'm sorry love. I must go now. Yes, l'm sorry. L'm sorry. Bye. L'll call you. Bye. I love you. I stepped on the floor and there was a mouse next to ,my foot. Can you imagine? Really? -Yes. I told Boris to take it out, but I don't think he did, because yesterday morning there were two of them. -Fuck. - I think there must be a whole brood of mice. I don't know what to do. What do you do, because I wouldn't want to... You know? I just can't. L'm sick of this. Quickly. -What is it? - Let's go. What is it? -Just run. Come on. -What is it? Why are we running? What's going on? - l'll tell you later. Hey, Sasha! -It was Greg's wife. - What? -Greg's wife. So that's why you're panicking. -Yes. What is she like? - A blonde. That's why you're panicking? Sasha... Yes? -What's going on? I told you. Really? Happy birthday. -Thanks. Today is my birthday? - Yes. -Thank you. I completely forgot. Well, let's see. What is this? The best. Look, it even has a small light. That's why I bought it. I knew you'd like it. It's better than the internet. Thank you. -Bravo, Edo! Hey. Did you know he taught me my first chords? Electroshock. - Cheers! -Electroshock. Fuck the birthday! You know, they say that in big cities there's this... Alienation. -Alienation. Nobody knows anybody. But I liked it that way. You know that girl, with the long hair... Joan Baez. - Joan Baez, right. It'll be a girl, we'll probably call her Ajda, or... Bye, Zdravc. -Edo... Bye, Sasha. Direction Ljubljana. Here, six hundred Euros. Just a second. Another hundred, so it's 700 altogether. What is this, Miss? - I brought you the money. I can't take that. You know exactly how much you owe. This is not the way it goes. Tellers are over there. That's not all of it, true, but 700 Euros is not such a small amount. lt's worth something. You owe 2,000 Euros. This is not the way you can do business. I trusted you, but you are late with your payment again. You obviously think that I'm some kind of a fool. No, I don't. If anybody here deserves to be called a fool, it should be me. Look, you owe 2,000. -I would bring the rest in a couple of days. I just wanted to prove to you that I was serious. Under the circumstances, I don't see how you managed to get the loan. Is that important? Listen, I've mortgaged the flat. True, but you don't want the bank to close on your loan and sell your flat. - Of course I don't. Well, that's the only thing a bank can do. Ma'am, my father is very ill. - l'm sorry to hear that, but I see no connection. - I did everything I could to get this flat. Then my father became ill and things just got worse. Please, understand. Miss... -He has a tumor. L'm sorry l'm the one to let you know. Fuck off! -Don't push me. - What is it? I just thought you should know. - Why are you lying? I know, it's because she dumped you! -No. Get lost. -lt's true! You're an idiot. -Fuck you. Hi. Sasha, wait. Sasha! Sasha, wait! Why are you running away, Sasha? What is it? - I didn't say anything. Why are you running after me? Life is one big disappointment after another. I'm afraid you're right. You won't tell Edo, will you? I don't know. How long have you been doing this? Doing what? -Come on. - What? What are you getting at? There's no need to say anything. It's all clear. I have to attend a lecture. - You're not going anywhere. Fine, l'll call Edo. Edo mustn't find out. I'm going to quit all this. I did it a couple of times because I needed the money. You're right. He mustn't find out... He couldn't take it. If you don't tell him, he won't find out. And now you're pinning the responsibility on me? Fine. Let's go. Go where? To the room. I've paid for it, so I'd better use it... Are you serious? - Why not? One client more... I can't. You're fucked then, because l'm calling Edo. Give me the money. I don't have it. Fuck you! Should we go for coffee? You're sick. L'M NOT THE SLOVENIAN GIRL - Shocking- Police catch the wrong person. Alexandra, can I ask you something? What is it? Are you on drugs? What's wrong with you? If you did drugs when you were young, it doesn't mean that l'm into the same shit! -Fine. Can I ask you something else? - Go ahead. Could it be that you're pregnant? What's with you? I'm not pregnant. Don't you worry. So, what is it? - What are you trying to say? You aren't depressed, are you? I could have passed it on to you. Oh, come on. -I just want to know what's going on with you. The thing I like about Ljubljana is that people don't interfere in other people's lives. Here everybody wants to know everything about everyone. Interfering in other people's lives is one thing. But telling your folks, the people who care for you, about your problems is something else. What do you tell them? What do you want to know? What's going on with you. Did you tell the ones who cared for you that mom was cheating on you? -Alexandra... What? - Oh, go fuck yourself! Are you coming back when you graduate? I don't know. -Should we go for a beer? -I can't, I have to pack. l'm going to Ljubljana tomorrow. L'm lonely. We're all lonely, each in his own way. Zdravc, come on over for one. I can't. I have to... -You'll do that later. Come for a beer. Are you a friend or are you not? Come for a beer. One beer for you. Alexandra, what will you have? -Nothing. OK, so it's two beers and one nothing. Mira, give us two beers. -Hi. How are things in Ljubljana? Cheers. -Cheers. L'm going home. She's been in a bad mood lately. She says she can't sleep. Yes? Is everything OK? -Sure. Here, l've ironed these. Hi, Vesna. Are you in Ljubljana? How are you? Not so good. Would you come and sleep over at my place tonight? I'm in kind of a mess. ...if you're not sure. Are you crazy? What do you want? We didn't finish our conversation the other time. I come to save you in the middle of the night and you're gone in the morning. -You really are sick. -l'm sick? L'm selling myself all over Ljubljana. What are you talking about? - You think I don't know? I thought we could talk in private but if you want Vesna to hear it as well. Sasha is a whore. She's selling herself. If I got it right, she's that Slovenian Girl.. The famous Slovenian Girl. This is the woman for whom I divorced my wife. A whore. I can't believe I was such an idiot. Vesna, are you a whore, too? - What? The two of you work together? Study well, girls. l'm not going to bother you any more. It's not true, is it? Greg is really one son of a bitch. L'm selling it. Selling what? The apartment, l'm selling it. It's a shame because it's really nice. I fucked up everything. I shouldn't have gotten myself into this. Yes, but after all of this... How much more do you have to pay? Too much. I just want a normal life. Here. -No, thanks. What is it? -Nothing. It's nice to have you back home.
