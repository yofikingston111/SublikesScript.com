Subtitles by explosiveskull Hello Mrs. Roberts, this is Dr. Williams, I'm here at the medical center. I just want to tell you that your daughter's been in a car accident. And we've taken here into the emergency... This is Dr. Williams, I'm here at medical center. Just want to let you that your daughter's been in a car accident. We've taken her into emergency. She slipped into a coma that night. A month had passed and we ended up taking Zoey home. The hospital and I did not agree on her future. They had a much different plan in mind. The doctor said she'll likely never be the same and at some point in time we should consider taking her off life support. I told him that I had faith in God's plan. He shook his head and walked away from me. I took leave of absence from the military and Zoey became a full time job for us. I don't know why you sleep in that chair, it's not like she's going anywhere. I never leave my post. And no-one ever said that you did. You hungry? So good. Oh man, Kurt, are you kidding. She didn't even ring the doorbell now, she... I'll tell her to ring the doorbell. That's just really great because then... Hi guys. How did she do last night with the fever? It's still at 100. Mmm. I'll go in there. 'kay. Should make you feel better. You ready to try again? No, it's happening again. I don't know why you keep touching the blind and opening it. She doesn't like it. We need to reintroduce her to the world Julie. She likes things just the way they are. She likes the solid light on. We'll keep the shades shut from now on. I wish I knew what was going on in that head of yours. You always have to force things Kurt like it's the army way. Happy birthday Mom! Um, let me start over. Happy Birthday Mom. I wish I could be there today with you but I'm at a camp and it's pretty nice. But I wish I could be there and wish you happy birthday in person but I'm gonna do this instead. Hope you have a great day and I hope that dad made a cake for you, but we'll see how that works out. So, anyway, I hope you have a wonderful day. If the brain is deprived of oxygen for more than four minutes, an oxygen injury will occur thus resulting in brain damage. Thus resulting in brain damage. Thus resulting in brain damage. Kurt. Honey. Lynette's leaving for the day. Right, well she's had all her medication for the night. I'm not going to be able to be here tomorrow. So I'll go ahead and get a temp. No, not necessary. I'm sure we can handle it for one day. Really, we've got this under control. Okay, well you have my cell number. If you have any problems give me a call. Okay. I was able to get some sleep. Why don't you get some rest. You sure? Yes, I'm sure. Dad. Listen to God, Dad. Are you listening? Zoey. Are you talking to me? I am listening. Is everything okay? Lynette, the ventilator stopped working. What do I do? Right, you need to remain calm. The breaker must have tripped again. Go to the breaker box. But the overhead light's still on. It's on a separate breaker. Breaker, breaker box. Breaker, right. Okay. How long has the vent been off? Are you there? Lynette, it's working! Good. How long was she without air? Just over a minute. We're fine. You did good. Oh thank god. Medicine 101. Yeah. Looks like a lot to read. Well it is, but I just want to make sure that I know everything about her condition because what happened yesterday really scared me. You know she's gonna pull through this. You don't know that. You need to read this. I do read that and you know it. Yeah, but, are you listening? Of course I'm listening. And what God's telling me is to learn everything I can so that I know what my daughter's going through. Your daughter. Sorry. Our daughter. I just can't sit here every day and feel sorry for us. It's tearing me apart. It's tearing us apart. I'm no good to her sitting here feeling sorry for us every day. But you know, this is giving me clarity. I haven't lost my faith. Good. Yes, sensitivity to light. It most certainly could, but without any further testing it's certainly hard to tell. So you're saying it sounds like brain damage then. It could very well be. With that amount of oxygen lost I highly doubt. Are you there? Yeah I'm here, I just thought maybe it would be a good sign. You know they did take the patient home really quickly. Why haven't you thought about bringing her in here so we could monitor the behavior. Because the family refuses to take her in for any more tests. Have you ever heard that with a coma patient before. I don't believe I have. No, neither have I. Well do what you can over there and assess the situation. Okay, Bob, cheers. - Bye - Bye. Lynette. What are you doing? I'm just trying to understand why she reacts to the light change. Let me make this very clear to you. That is my daughter. She is not your experiment. She's just trying to help. I understand. It won't happen again. Can I speak to you both about something. Maybe in the other room. Right, I've been going over Zoey's folder and patients that experience sensitivity to light variation have been known to be linked with brain damage. She does not have brain damage. When are you people going to understand that? Look I don't want to upset you but please hear me out okay? Okay. The sensitivity to light change is only found with patients that are responsive. Responsive. That's a good sign right. It could be. That light situation in there, just leave it alone. Alright, all I'm saying is that she's responding. Then, let's look into that. Okay. What's in the folder? Zoey's file. Can I see it? Sure, you don't have copies of her file? No, the hospital process was being so difficult so that's why Zoey's home here with us. We never got anything like this. Nothing. No loss. Records. This is Michelle. Yes, this is Sergeant Major Kurt Roberts. I'm calling in regards to my daughter Zoey Roberts who was a patient there... Hello? This is Michelle. Hi this is Sergeant Major Kurt Roberts. I believe we were disconnected. Hello? I'm here. Take down this number. Okay, let me get a pen. Go ahead. You wanted to talk about your daughter's file. Yes I did. Okay. Well I'm having trouble understanding hospital reports. What you want to know about is oxygen loss. When I spoke with the paramedics that night. He said that she was breathing on her own. But I was told to put down the excessive oxygen loss. Doesn't make any sense. When they tested her for brain damage, she failed the test. The doctor figured she must have stopped breathing prior to the paramedics arriving on the scene. So she failed the test? Yes she did. Are these her reports? Yes. Do you mind? No, go ahead. These are her results. So there's no way to tell if this five minutes is even accurate? Right. Happy birthday Mom. Um, let me start over. Happy birthday Mom. I wish I could be there today with you but I'm at camp and it's pretty nice but I wish I could be there and wish you happy birthday in person but I'm gonna do this instead. Hope you have a great day and I hope that Dad made a cake for you, well we'll see how that works out. So anyway, I hope you have a wonderful day. Zoey, do you remember when your mom's hair caught on fire from all those birthday candles that wouldn't blow out? I think it was all the hairspray that made it so flammable. Man, she was mad. Can you imagine if I wouldn't have put those things out. Your mother and I, we love you very much. Kurt. It's Zoey calling. What? Zoey's calling my phone. Hello? That was strange. Why? Nothing but static. It's completely off. You don't think she was trying to communicate with us, do you? It's probably a phone glitch or something. Yeah it's gotta be a phone glitch. I mean that doesn't even make sense right? Hi. Hi. - Hey. - Am I interrupting anything? No you're fine. How is Zoey today? She's good. That was quite a scare you had yesterday. Yeah it was. Now you know what to do. Mm hmm. Good. I talked with the staff nurse at the hospital today. And she showed me some interesting things about Zoey's records. You see right here, where it looks like something was scribbled out. Apparently they don't even know if she sustained any oxygen loss. Right, but they did do a Glasgow on her. And exactly what is that? Well it's a series of tests to check a patient's coherence to follow directions, limb movement and speech to see if a patient has brain damage. And when do they take this test? Usually, immediately after an accident. And that determines whether someone is brain damaged. I know what you're thinking. I'm thinking after an accident. Someone's gotta be confused. They usually are. But they tried to do a second test on her and failed. She'd already slipped into a coma. I just don't think she's brain damaged at all. I hope you're right. Yes sir. I'm gonna need additional time. Sir... No sir, you don't understand. My daughter's condition is improving and they need me here. 30 days and then I return. Thank you sir. You have to go back. They gave me 30 more days. And then what? I have to go back. It's ridiculous. You've been there almost 30 years. You should be able to take off as much time as you want. You know how this works. Kurt, I can't do this by myself. You need to fix this. We'll figure something out. 30 days is not gonna be enough. There are people there that depend on me. You know what, I don't care about them and 30 days is not enough. You little bugger. You just moved your arm didn't you. Julie, Kurt, come quick! Do you think you could do that again for me please. What? She moved. What did she move? Her arm and then her finger. You can do it again. Does this mean she's coming out of the coma. It's a very good possibility. Honey, move your finger. Why is she not doing it again? You gotta talk to her as if she can hear you. Honey, it's your mother. Can you move your fingers so Mom can see it. Zoey please move your fingers so Mom can see it. What? Nothing. She moved. It's a good thing. It's a good thing. Yes, it's a good thing. Stop lying to me. Hey. Perhaps we should discuss this out there. Zoey, God is proud of you. We're proud of you. You did a good job. Your father's right. We're very proud of you Zoey. I'm sorry, I overreacted in there. You said she moved. Did she move? Yes, she moved. Then it's a breakthrough isn't it? It could be. It doesn't necessarily mean she'll come out of the coma. It could just be reflexive. - I think it's a good sign. - You know what I think. I think you overreacted in there. What was that all about? She said she was sorry. She's trying to help. I've been coming here since Zoey came home. I've never seen her move. Today she moved. If you think me unprofessional, I'll go. I guess it just took me off guard. I guess? Listen, we know that she can hear us. We know that she's responding to us. We need to be strong for her. Give me your hands. God I know you're up there lookin' out for us troops. Sorry. God I know you're looking out for us and that wonderful girl in there. Give her the strength and guidance to find her way to us. We'll do anything that you ask of us to do. Amen. Thank you so much for not calling us troops. Julie convinced me that we needed to know more about Zoey's condition medically. So we studied everything we could get our hands on. We knew every dosage and what every medication was for. It became an obsession for us. An obsession to be informed. Medicine wasn't the only thing we studied. I now know what the only thing was that really kept us going: Our faith. I'll never forget what Zoey had said to me in the dream: Am I listening. Am I listening? Then out of the blue, a stranger came to the door with some crazy invention. Hi I'm Raulston. I'm here to... try to communicate with a subject in a comatose state. Uh, are you gonna let me in or should I just go? Oh, I'm sorry. Please come in. Raulston you're here. Honey! What did you say your name was? Raulston. R-A-U-L-S-T-O-N. Raulston's here. Raulston, pleasure to meet you. I see you brought your stuff. Why don't you bring that in here and let's see what you got. Okay, why don't we start with explaining what you have here and what you're able to achieve. Okay. First thing you need to know is that this program is, it's in it's infancy stage. But what I can do is, what happens is the brain it kind of, um. It sends out this algorithm that I can pick up from here by electronic signal and when you ask certain questions, you can get certain answers from people that are say, in a different state of mind, i.e. your daughter who's in a coma. Right, what he's trying to explain is that he's developed a system to communicate with someone who can't speak. - How many words do you have? - Four. Four words: yes, no, stop, go. Basics. Four words. You'd be surprised what kind of information you can get with just four words if you ask the right question. Why don't we show them. Right, sure. May I, sir? Sure. Okay. Now, what I'm gonna do, is I'm gonna ask you a series of questions: Yes, no, stop, go type answers. And what I want you to do is, don't say 'em verbally, just think answers. You understand right? Yes. Okay, first question. Do you like ice-cream. Yes. No, no, don't talk. Just think the answer. Sorry it was a reflex. But that's what this whole thing is about, is reflexes. When somebody asks you a question like something like do you like ice cream. Your brain sends it down to here and says, Hey I like ice-cream. I don't like ice-cream. I couldn't care less about ice-cream. Decide against saying it out loud. Shh. Think. Alright, another question. Can you fly. Okay. Ask me a question, only I know the answer to. Only you would know the answer to. Okay, um, okay. Everything okay? Technology, you gotta love it. Okay, question. Do you have a brother? I have a question we can ask. Did you skip the fourth grade? Did you skip the fourth grade? Did you skip the fourth grade? Ask if I skipped the fifth grade. Fifth grade, fifth grade. Did you skip the fifth grade. I did skip the fifth grade. That's impressive. I have one question. May I please ask it? Go ahead. Do you want to use my system? There. So, you're thinking of using this on Zoey? Yes. Okay, your first question. Do you understand what's going on here? She says yes. Do you understand that mom and dad are with you? She says yes. We should ask her if she's comfortable? Yes that's a good question. She says no. All this time. She's been uncomfortable this whole time. I can't believe this. Honey, where does it hurt? Ma'am you need to stick to questions I can answer with my four answers, otherwise it can't work. Where do we begin? We need to narrow it down. She's right. We should ask her if her head hurts. We need to know that. I'm not ready for that. We need to know. Okay, her numbers are rising. Come on. We need to know. I don't want to know the answer. She says no. Honey, where does it hurt? Ma'am, I really, really need you to use those questions that lead to those four answers otherwise we are wasting our complete time here. I understand the four words. We need to be more specific with our questions. You guys the numbers are rising. Hurry up. Kurt, hurry and ask a question. Is it your body that hurts? Yes. Is it your stomach? It's affecting her physically and her numbers are rising. She says yes. Is it the medicine? What's going on? I'm losing connection. Hurry up, fix it. You need to stop. Yes. Is it the liquid diet? It's getting dangerously high now guys, we need to stop. Turn it off, right now. It has been the medicine all along. Raulston turn the machine off. Turn it off. It's off. It's okay, her numbers are coming down. I'm so sorry. We were just trying to help you. Is she okay? Yeah, she's fine now. Look, why were her numbers being affected? Was it emitting some kind of charge? I don't know what you mean. Well, were the wires emitting some kind of electrical charge? Yes, but it's very minor. Less than a static. Well it's obviously something big Raulston. We've never tested it on a coma patient before. So we didn't know what was gonna happen nor could we predict what was gonna happen. Okay, we won't use it on her again. Well, before we use it again. We're gonna find out exactly what the safety problems are. What are the dangers with this thing? Or in a hospital situation. Exactly. Can't use it in a hospital. Why not? I've tried and... got arrested. And you were gonna tell me this when? Am I in trouble? No you're not in trouble. When he used that on you. Did you feel any sensations. I felt some sensations, but they were minor. I mean, they were hardly anything. They were obviously something or her numbers wouldn't change so dramatically Kurt. Look, we need to focus on the medications that are hurting her. Julie! I'm not mad at you. I just don't know if I can do this anymore. Didn't you see what happened in there? Yes, I saw what happened in there. Can you imagine being imprisoned in your own body. People poking at you. And you can't say no. As horrible as that sounds, I still feel this was a breakthrough for us. And if it is a breakthrough, then why do I feel worse? I don't know why God has planned this for us. But I trust he knows exactly what he's doing. Our daughter's alive and well and what happened in there proves it. Think about this, if she is communicating and I believe she is, we need to help her find her way back. And what if she can't find her way back and it's as frustrating for her as it is for us. I was determined to find a way to lower the electrical charge the machine emitted. So Raulston put me through a crash course on physics and explained how his machine worked. He explained that we emit pulses from the brain and these pulses each have their own signature, similar to voice. He would try one level up and then another in hopes to reducing the charge. We must have gone over it a dozen times. There had to be some way that could make it not affect Zoey's vitals. But every time we lowered the voltage, the machine became useless. There must be something we overlooked. So I went through every book Raulston brought with him hoping to find something, some clue. There had to be something. I was determined to find the answer. But in the end we failed. It just wouldn't work without emitting some tiny electrical charge. Is that what our life's going to be? A routine where I come in here and sit with my daughter, night after night, month after month. I just knew she was in there. Well aware of us. I think it's one of the evening medications. Well it could be the anti-seizure. Why is she on that? To prevent the seizures, but they usually take them off it after a couple of weeks. I've taken it off the list. She should have been off it a while back. Well let's hope it makes her feel better. Now she's off that heavy dose she may become more responsive. Could that be the reason she's still in a coma? I'm no doctor but yeah, it's possible. It happens. I mean, what does a parent have to become a medical expert to catch stuff like this? It certainly would help. Hey. How long you been sitting out here. I remember her first day of school. That place must have looked so big to her through her little eyes. She must have been so scared. What kind of God takes you all that way just to bring you to here. A God that has a plan for us. It's quite the plan God has. You sure you want to do this? Yes, I'm sure. Okay what's your first question? Does she feel better without the medicine. She said yes. Does she know what happened to her? She said no. Does this machine bother her? She said yes. Can she get out of this coma on her own? No. Can I help her? Yes. Is there something I've overlooked... I better turn this off. Is there something I've overlooked? Does she want me to turn this machine off? Um, okay. It's got to be a typo. I mean, you know, four words: yes, no, go, stop. Right, I mean. This word's not in it. Call me crazy, call me nuts, call me bat-crazy but it's not in there right. Okay, I asked and it said this. Zoey, are you saying that it's in God's hands? Or are you saying to listen to God? Do we need to listen to God? Yeah I think it's safe to say that I'm gonna go. And I'm done with this. There's just no freaking way that this, what just happened, or whatever this is, just happened. 'Cause I could've sworn it said God. You saw it say "God", I saw it say "God". Heck I'm pretty sure God saw it say God. No, no, no, yes. And now it says "Go." Are you freaking listening to me? It says "Go", not "God". It was God. Well it's all good. Sorry I'm going crazy. That's when I realized there's a higher force working here. What was God trying to tell me? Was he telling me to stop all this experimenting and let Zoey find her way on her own. Was he telling me to continue fighting? More time passed and I was left with no option but to retire from the service. I guess we thought something should have happened by now. It began to take it's toll on us. Julie began to sleep more and more which left me to tend to taking care of things on my own. I wanted to know more about all the medications Zoey was on. I just felt something was wrong there. I was hoping that taking her off the seizure medication would have helped her wake up. It still just seemed like she was on too much medication. I really had no idea what I was doing. Or if what I was doing was making any difference. I kept forging ahead. Watching her lay there in that bed. I don't think Julie would have eaten if I didn't insist. Today's our anniversary. Got ya a card. Let me go get you some more water. Zoey has had her meds. Thank you. Looks like you have your hands full. You could say that. You know, in the service, I've been through a lot. But this, this is really testing me. Has she spoken to you? Very little. She just stares off. I think she's given up. Zoey moved again today. Really? That's good. Yeah. Things are gonna get better. I pray you're right. Well I'm gonna go. Are you gonna be okay? I'm gonna be fine. Thank you. Okay. Julie! It's okay. Zoey. Mom and Dad are here. Oh Zoey! How can I help. I think she wants to go somewhere. Come on. At least she's awake. It's okay. You're doing okay. She's not okay. She's not okay. She seems different. It's got something to do with the medication. Did you see that in there? She can't speak. She doesn't even know who we are and she can barely walk. It's not the medication. It's not the medication, she's different. You're gonna have to figure out what to do with that life. That life? You know exactly what I mean? We took Zoey to the doctors. Everything seemed great. Zoey was awake. It was a miracle. It was difficult not to get angry at God. It took everything I had to keep focused. Where is she? We're over here. It's a miracle. Yes it is. Can I go see her? Sure. Hi Zoey. It's lovely to see you out of that bed. I'm so glad you're enjoying the day. And this happened yesterday. She just woke up. Zoey I'm gonna talk to Lynette inside for a second so go ahead and enjoy the day. I can't believe she's awake. I can't believe it either. I just thought... She'd jump out of bed and run around talking. Yeah. She's been in a coma for five months. It doesn't work like that. She's going to pretty much have to relearn everything. The doctors say that she's showing signs of brain damage, like they originally thought. Yeah, I'm sorry about that. She may improve though. Not if we don't make some changes. What are you talking about? Lynette, do you mind? Sure, no problem. Whatever this drug is, that helps her breathe. It's also affecting her motor skills. We took Zoey off the paralytic and in days, she improved. Then she woke up. What? Look, I can see you've been doing a lot of reading here but... Hear me out. She no longer needs the ventilator. Why is she still on that medication? Because it prevents her passageway from closing. Do you really want to take that risk? Yes, I do. You saw her out there. She's not gonna improve, not being so heavily medicated. Kurt, you're not a doctor. Now, I'm really impressed with everything you know about this drug. But I've got to be frank with you, this could be really dangerous. What if you're wrong? I'm not and I'm willing to take that chance. What do you want me to do? I want you to help me take her off the medication she's on. I can't do that. Okay, I'll help. But only with a doctor's consent. First let me see if I can get them to even listen. Two weeks had passed. And we had heard nothing from the doctor. Okay. Zoey, what's this? I'm gonna go talk to your mom for a minute okay. I'll be right back. Hey, you alright? I'm so glad she came out of the coma. But I don't know her anymore. She just needs some time to relearn everything. Really? And what if that's the best that we get, then what? Then we love her for who she is. Oh, I know, God's plan. How could I forget? With this we can take her off the medications. Including the paralytics. That's what it says. How did you do this? It wasn't easy, but I convinced them. Convinced them? What are you talking about? We're going to take Zoey off of all her medications. Really Kurt? You didn't explain this to her? No, I didn't. And what are the repercussions of that. She could choke to death. It's the paralytics. Look, I'll be here to make sure the transition goes smoothly. I hope we're doing the right thing. We are doing the right thing. Have you thought about the guilt if something happens to her? Aren't you gonna say anything? I've thought about it. I'm not finished. Okay. Do you want to know why I agreed to do this? I know why you agreed to it. Can I go through? Ap... Apple. Apple. Zoey. You said apple. Yes... I did. How... have you been, Mom? I've been great Zoey. Oh my God, I'm so happy. I... said apple, Dad. It's working. Okay. Why doesn't she have her portable oxygen? I'm okay. Your lungs are still weak. You have to breathe in deep. It's gonna take you a while to get you back in shape. Bathroom. You have to go. I'll help you. No, I'm fine. Give her some space. Are you sure? Please. Give her some space. I don't want her to fall or anything. She's gonna be fine. Zoey! The door's locked. Zoey! Zoey! She failed the Glasgow test twice yet she's recovering. Wow. Gonna have to keep your eye on her even in the bathroom Mom. Okay. That was my fault. I told her not to go in there. Don't do that again okay. I won't. He won't. Over the next couple of weeks we worked with her non-stop. Her muscles were in pretty bad shape but Zoey was determined to get them back the way they were. It was so great to see the life in her eyes again. The rest of the world must have gone on without us. But we continued, every day, til she got stronger and stronger. We were a family again. So... Dad. Just take your time. You ...retired. Yes, I retired from the service. I wanted to make sure that I was home when you woke up. But what about your men. Don't they need you. It was time for someone else to take over. How's your pie? Really good. So what happened to me that night? Don't you remember I told you. You were in a car accident. No. But was it my fault. No. It wasn't your fault. You were hit by a drunk driver. What was the person's name. Do I know what his name was? His name was David. What was he like? He was a horrible man. He should be put away for a long time. But instead he's living a normal life. Well she has to know what kind of man he is. Can I meet him? Zoey that's absurd. You want to meet him? Yes. I don't know if he'll even meet with you. Why would you want to meet somebody like him. Can I ask him? I can call him and ask. It's what I want. There he is. You sure you want to go through with this? Yes. Hi I'm David. Have a seat. You don't drive a car. No. I don't drive anymore. So... you're the man that hit my car that night. Yes I did. Why? I had a drinking problem and I was drunk. My mom... said you should... go to jail. But... do you know why I wanted to meet you? No I don't. I didn't want you to be the monster in my nightmares. Now, that I finally met you, you won't be a monster. I wanted to tell you how sorry I am for what I did to you. I forgive you. I know this is hard so... You can go. I don't know if you believe this or not, but I pray for you every day. I believe you. I'll never forget that day in the park. It was like watching a miracle. We later found out that one of the medications that assisted with breathing was actually suppressing her recovery of motor skills. Her atrophy was finally overcome and she ended up graduating high school in the top 10% of her class. From then on, Zoey was completely normal and moved on from that part of her life like it never happened. Well I just graduated from high school and I'm on my way to college in about two months. And I actually made it. Can you take a picture. I want to go see my friends. Today Zoey's in college living a normal life and fulfilling her dreams. Subtitles by explosiveskull
