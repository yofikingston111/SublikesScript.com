If it isn't my favorite sister. Well, I'm your older sister, but I'll take it. So you're down there already? And in the Christmas spirit, I see. Yeah, I just walked in. - How does the place look? - Good. The same. A little dusty. Look. Can't believe I didn't get down here once last year. Oh, really? Wow. It's been probably a couple of years since I've been there. Really? Kind of bittersweet, huh? I'm not sure I can taste the sweet part of this. Come on, Margs. Come on. We talked about this. It's the right thing to do. Is it? Yes. It's too expensive to keep. Well, if Tom would just pull his weight... Hey, come on, now. Come on. It's the season of the year to be charitable. Besides, we've already made this decision, right? I know, but then I got down here and this place is filled with so many memories. Well, I'll be there in a couple of days. At least we'll be able to say goodbye together. - Yeah. - And cheer up! It's Christmas. Okay. - Bye. - Bye. "It was then that Caroline realized" that it didn't matter if her house was big or small or not much of a house at all. A home is more than bricks and blocks and windows and locks. A home is more than a bed or where you rest your head. They say that home is where the heart is, and Caroline knew that to be true. But what she didn't realize "is that your home is within you." Thank you all so much for coming. It's such a pleasure to read in a place that I love so much, and in a place that I call home. I'm going to be sticking around for a little bit if anybody would like to get a copy of their book signed. Hey, Jackie. Thanks again. Are you kidding me? You're really getting good. - Think so? - Yeah, I know so. Did you see those kids faces? They loved it. You know, you pull in more customers than most of the other authors I have in here. It's the local draw, but it did feel nice. Great message, too. Mm. I wish I believed it. Shh. Your fans. Yeah, right. Hey, what's going on? You look like you saw a ghost. N-Nothing. I'll tell you about it later. You better. In the meantime, your adoring public awaits. Mm. Hi, guys. What's your name? Do you want me to sign this for you? - Yes, please. - Okay. Is your family here yet? No, Meredith, Jeff, and Ace get in on Thursday. - What about Tom? - Mr. Reliable? He's probably in the Caribbean somewhere. Good for him. He's supposed to come, but I'll believe it when I see it. He'll settle down someday. Or maybe he won't. So what's your plan while you're here? Oh... This is actually our last Christmas here. We have to sell the house. - What? - Yeah. How long have we known about this? A few months now, but it didn't seem final until I got here. Meredith and Tom hired a realtor who evidently has a buyer that wants to close before the end of the year, sight unseen. So what does that mean? You won't come down here anymore? - I guess not. - How do you feel about that? Terrible. I mean, it makes sense with Mom and Dad gone, but the Cape is part of me. Oh, Margot, I'm so sorry. Well, if this is your last Christmas, then you better make it a good one. See, that's exactly what I was thinking. I want to make this the most special Christmas ever. That's the spirit. And then maybe I can convince Tom and Meredith that this place is so great, they shouldn't sell. How likely is that? At this point, not very. - Ahh. - You need to take that? - No, that's my agent. - Then answer it. No, she's just calling to see if I have any new pages. And I take it you don't. No. I've been feeling pretty stuck the last few weeks. My mind's been on other stuff. Well, that's understandable. Hey, I'm sure you'll figure it out. I hope you're right. Christian. Hey, can I help you something? Yeah, this gallery. I haven't seen it before. Is it new? Yeah, we just opened. Let me know if you have any other questions. I was just looking at these beautiful paintings. They capture the feel of the Cape so well. Who's the artist? It's a local artist, actually. I think his name is Christian something? - Christian? - Yeah. Do you know him? I... We were k... - Christian? - Yeah. I am Christian, the artist. I just... I don't like to lead with that. I don't want to taint people's opinions of the work. Christian, it's Margot. Bradford. I know. I'm so sorry, I'm messing with you, I saw you at your book reading. What? You...? I thought I recognized you. Yeah. Wow, how long has it been? It must be 20 years. My gosh, you look exactly the same Taller. Yeah. - And you're... - Not a ponytailed tomboy? Hardly. Wow. The last time I saw you was right before your family moved to Michigan. Yeah, that's right. Grand Rapids. You remember. Of course I did. Yeah. Wow. So are you here now for good or...? Uh, for now. Yeah, after Michigan, my dad got transferred to Sydney, Australia. - You're kidding. - No, it was great. We spent about 10 years Down Under and then we went to Europe, studied there for a couple of years, traveled around a lot, and landed back here on the Cape. - Wow. - How about you? I live in Boston. I have since college. Seems very boring compared to your world travels. And you write children's books. That's not boring at all. Well, I guess that's true. How's the family? Oh... they're good. Yeah, my mom and dad died a few years back. My mom from cancer and my dad from a broken heart. Yeah, they say that happens. I'm sorry. I remember them well. They were great people. Thanks. So are you here alone or...? - Yeah, it's just me. - Oh. My sister and her family and hopefully my brother are coming next week to celebrate Christmas. Oh, like the good old days. Yeah. It is so great to see all of your artwork. You always were such an incredible artist. Yeah, I guess it just kind of stayed with me. It sure did. It was such a nice surprise running into you. Yeah, it was a wonderful surprise. Come back in anytime. - Bye. - Bye. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Oh, you, uh... you've got to really push it. It gets stuck.

There's only a couple of coffee shops in town. Do you wanna join me? Sure. Um... you sit and I'll grab you a coffee. Thanks. Oh, regular coffee, or are you like a sophisticated, urban author that only drinks lattes now? Regular coffee, black, strong, unadulterated. Okay. I remember that decisive quality about you. Can I get another coffee, please? It is so weird seeing you. Good weird or bad weird? Good weird. Yeah, I feel like I know you so well, but I missed the whole growing-up part, and I'm just wondering if you're the same guy. - I'm the same guy. - Just with facial hair. Yeah. So I woke up this morning and something occurred to me. - What was that? - Well... this is actually our last Christmas on the Cape. - You're kidding. - I wish I was. We have to sell the house. Why? Well, my siblings don't want to keep it up anymore, and I don't have enough money to buy the other two out. - It's far too common a scenario. - But I was wondering if maybe I could commission you to paint a picture of our house. I want to give it to my sister for Christmas. I think she would love it. Sorry, you can't commission me. Oh, why, are you booked? - I don't do commissioned work. - Oh, okay. But I will make you a deal. What kind of deal? Do you remember years ago, I drew a portrait of you? Yeah, I still have it. You do? Okay, well, I will paint your house if you'll let me draw you again. I don't think a picture of me would warrant a place on your gallery wall. I disagree. Really, you'll paint a picture of our house? Yeah. I'd be honored. Okay, you have a deal. Great. How long do I have? - Until Friday, Christmas Eve. - Oh. Oh, okay. My sister and her family get in on Thursday. Is that enough time? Uh, it's going to be tight. I'd have to come over every day to work on it. - Okay. - That works for you? Yeah, that'd be great, catching up. And what will you be doing? Oh, I will be busy providing you with snacks and drinks and anything else you might need. Yeah, that'll be helpful. And I'll be decorating the house and getting ready for the Christmas Eve feast. That sounds nice. Well, unfortunately, my motives aren't quite so selfless. I'm hoping to make it so special that my sister reconsiders selling. Gotcha. - So I'll see you tomorrow? - Yeah. Bright and early. - Thanks for the coffee. - You're welcome. Hey, Jackie. I'm kind of in Christmas overload. What time are you done with work? Mm. I so needed this. So, any progress on the new book? Uh... no. I've been too distracted. What's it going to be about? I'm thinking it's going to have a Christmas theme. So you haven't even started it yet? Well, uh... no. But I ran into a Christmas angel this morning and it sparked an idea. A Christmas angel, huh? Do you remember Christian Williams? Of course I do. He just opened up the new gallery right next door. He's who I thought I saw the other day at the book signing. He's your Christmas angel? He's painting our house for me, for my sister. It's going to be the best Christmas present. You're kidding me. And he's not even charging. What... Oh, you guys had a little something, right? Oh, no. Come on. We were just kids. But he was my first kiss. Well, now. Any rekindled feelings there? I don't know. Maybe. He's ridiculously cute. It probably won't even matter. In all likelihood, I won't be spending very much time down here in the future anyway. I believe in angels, you know. Please. We're getting way too ahead of ourselves. A girl can dream, can't she? Oh, I had such a crush on him when we were kids. I think I cried for a week when he left. Well, just be careful. Rumor is, he's got a reputation. Reputation for what? It's just what people say about him. Be careful, you hear me? Oh, thanks, Mom. - Good morning, sunshine. - Hi. I... I fell asleep on the couch. Good thing you had your Santa hat on. - It was for inspiration. - Ah. Come in. I'll put on some coffee, I actually brought you some. - Thank you. - You're welcome. And I brought you a breakfast sandwich. Gosh, thank you so much. The house doesn't have any food. I haven't had a chance to go to the store yet. - Yeah, I figured. - What time is it? - 7:00. - You do start early. Yeah, I've always been a bit of an early riser. I like to walk on the beach first thing in the morning. Best time of day. - Have you been already? - Yep. Maybe I'll take you with me one of these mornings. Yeah. Oh, wow. You have a fake Christmas tree? Yeah. Like, in the box. It's... That's not not going to do. Of course it will do. I mean, not if you're trying to impress anyone. What are you talking about? It's completely practical. You set it up and then when Christmas is over, you stuff it back in the box and you're good to go for next year. It's what we've always done. Okay. Suit yourself. Are you getting self-righteous right now about a Christmas tree? I'm just saying, it's... you know. I don't have time to go get a real tree anyway. Okay, well, I'd better to get to work. I wanted to see the house in the morning light. - Thank you for the coffee. - You're welcome. Mm. Hmm. Painter's block? - Something like that. - I can relate. Blank canvas is probably as intimidating as a blank page. I actually can't get over how big the red beech has gotten. I remember being like half the size. Yeah, it's my favorite tree. Secret fort in the cedar bushes? Still there. Hmm. Listen, I know you said you wanted a painting of the house, but... as I was sitting there, I started thinking, is it really the house or is it this? I hadn't considered that. What is your absolute favorite memory of this place? My favorite memories are down on the beach. I thought so. But without the house, no beach. Exactly. C'mere. Okay. Here, sit down. This is what I'm saying. You see, it is this view framed in by the porch. It's special. You're so right. "Home is more than bricks and blocks" and windows and locks. "A home is more than a bed or where you rest your head." Somebody very wise once wrote that. "Your home is within you." I'm gonna bring my stuff up here. Hey, so how did you get into writing children's books, anyway? I don't know. I guess I've always loved the way that children see the world. Naive, but inquisitive and honest. That makes sense. Plus, reading's always been such an escape for me. Anne of Green Gables, right? I can't believe you remember that. Yeah, I have that book upstairs in my room. - No way. - Yeah. That's the book that made me want to be an author. Not that my children's books hold a candle to Lucy Maud Montgomery, but least I can give back a little bit. Here, let me help you. Oh, thanks. So do you want kids of your own one day? Yeah, if the right person comes along. - Hmm. - You? Definitely, as long as they're boys. No, I'm kidding. I've been meaning to ask, where are you living now? I actually got a little place down by the water. - Oh. - Next to a lighthouse that you might remember. - Oh, yeah. - Yeah. Is it just you, or...? It is just me, but I do have a special lady in my life. - Oh. - Yeah, her name's Maggie. - What's she like? - Well, she's got brown hair. She's about 80 pounds and she drools a lot. - She sounds lovely. - Maggie is my chocolate lab. I was in a relationship not too long ago, but we wanted different things. Is that why you moved back? I'd rather not talk about it, if that's okay. Just... old relationships are super boring. Yeah, you're right. Hey, do you remember when we were kids and you gave me that little compass? Of course. I was just about to move to Michigan, and you told me that I could use it to find my way back home. Exactly. I guess it worked. I guess it did. Hey, sorry I'm late. I was cutting this thing down. - Christian! - What you think? Is it too tall? If it is, I can trim the bottom. I told you I didn't need a real tree. Yeah, and I think you do, because Christmas is not the time for practicality. It's the time for authenticity, especially if you want to impress your siblings. - I don't know what to say. - Say "thank you." Thank you. You're welcome. Come on, let me help you set it up. I cannot believe this. It was just sitting there, begging to be cut down. Okay, how's that? Is it straight? Hang on. Uh, nope. - No? - This way. Okay, right there. Tighten that up. Okay. Got it. - Oh. - Wow. Thanks. Tell me again why practical is bad? Oh, come on. You got to admit, a real tree is way more Christmas-y. Can't beat that smell. It does smell wonderful. It'll make a difference, even if it only elevates your Christmas spirit a degree or two. It was very thoughtful of you. I really appreciate it. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Hey, sis! I'm just unloading the car from the grocery store I'm making Grandma's pot roast for dinner. Alright. I guess we sort of have to have the pot roast, don't we? Of course you have to make the pot roast. We always make the pot roast. Alright, well, we'll be down there sometime around noon day after tomorrow, so hopefully we'll be there in time for dinner. Cool, I was thinking we could just have Chinese that night. Oh, that sounds great. Anything else you need? - Mm, some wine. - I'm on it. Hey, do you remember Christian Williams? Oh, my gosh, wow. Course. You two were inseparable. - He's here. - What? Yeah, it's kind of a long story. I'll tell you all about it later. No, no, no. Margot, spill it. Jeez, I bet he grew up to be incredibly hot. Times ten. Margot! Alright, I got to go. I'll talk to you later. - Margot... - Bye! Don't... did you just hang up on me? You did, didn't you? You're unbelievable. - Hey. - Hi. How long you been standing there? Not long. How's it going? Oh, no, you don't get to see until it's done. - Come on. - No, stop. Uh-uh. Okay, well, I could use some help decorating that gorgeous Christmas tree you brought me. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. You want to take a break and give me a hand? Sure. We've got about an hour until sunset. I don't wanna miss that light. - Okay. - Okay. Oh, hey, it's starting to look pretty good. Yeah, we still have a long way to go. Yeah. Oh. I know this girl. No. No, no! Give me that. Give me that. Oh, come on. You were adorable. So are you going to help me or what? Yeah. Yeah, sorry. - Okay. - Okay, what do you need? - Hand me the box. - Box. ♪ Oh, Christmas tree, oh, Christmas tree ♪ ♪ All aglow, your branches ♪ Christmas tree, oh, Christmas tree ♪ ♪ With tinsel ropes and candles ♪ ♪ Silver bows and golden light ♪ Shine so brightly in the night ♪ I can see that it's a chocolate bar now.

I could not have done this without you. It's my pleasure. Sorry I didn't leave you very much time to paint. That's okay. I'm making mental notes. I'll get back to it tomorrow. You know, seeing the place like this, I have no idea how I'm going to let it go. Do you have to let it go? Yeah, I don't really have a choice. My siblings want to sell it, particularly my brother, - But you don't want to sell. - Are you kidding? No. Well, it sounds like you might have some thinking to do. Yeah, I guess you're right. You have been so incredibly helpful. Can I take you to dinner tonight? Ahh... I'm... I'm sorry, I can't, but maybe some other time. Okay, sure. But I will be back tomorrow to paint. Okay. Yeah, yeah. I should work on my book anyway. It's not going to write itself. Yeah. Here you go. Thank you. Um. I'll see you tomorrow. Oh, and please don't look at the painting yet, 'cause it's not ready. Promise? I promise. Okay. Have a nice night. Margot, sweetheart, where have you been? Hey, Judith. Sorry, I go away for the holidays. Holidays, schmalidays. Where are my pages? Publishing waits for no one. I know. I promise I'll have something brilliant for you in the next few days. Mm, okay, doll. Where do you go again every year? Nantucket? - Cape Cod. - Right. That's... that's actually one of the things that I wanted to talk to you about. What do you need? I was wondering if it might be possible to get an advance on my next book. I've decided I want to buy my family's Cape house and my brother and sister don't really want to sell it, and some extra money could help me figure it all out. Honey, you know I'd love to negotiate in advance for you, but... The sales on your last book weren't quite what the publisher expected. I'm really not sure I can get approval for something like that. I can barely get advances on our established children's authors. Right. I guess I'll just reason with my unreasonable siblings. Do you know, we've come here every year since I was a kid? Hmm. Sounds darling. How could they want to sell this place? What, dear? Nothing. So what's your next book? How far into it are you? Oh, about halfway. Um, it's about a... family tree at Christmas. Mmm. Why don't you write another book because your character Caroline? People love a series. Or I could do that. I'm sorry I can't get you that advanced, Margot. Maybe if you or a little more well-known internationally. Let's try to get you there, okay, doll? Okay. Hey, merry Christmas. You too, kiddo. Good morning. Is everything okay? What time is it? Oh, yeah, everything's okay. It's early. Do you want to go for that walk on the beach with me? Wow, you are a morning person, aren't you? Yeah. Coffee? Plus, I want to show you something. Go get dressed. I'll meet you out front. I've never seen it like this. Something about it, right? Magical. We get so caught up in our busy lives and our cellphones, we forget to stop and take in where we are. I think this might be my favorite place on Earth. Me too. It's why I came back. Maggie! Come here. Come here. Hi. What's up? What are you going to do if you have to sell the house? I don't know, but I think it's going to break my heart. Do you remember when we used to dig up quahogs under the dock? Do you remember when we carved our initials under there? I'll race you. Oh, like the good old days. - On three? - Mm-hmm. Okay. - One. - Uh-huh. Two. You're such a cheater! Maggie, come on! Do you see it? - No. - Ahh. Oh, hey, here it is. Wow. So many years have gone by. It's still there. Yeah. We should probably get going. Why, what's the rush? My family's coming, and you need to finish your painting, and I don't want to hurt you when I leave. Yeah. Right. Maggie, c'mon. Hey, how's it going? Uh, pretty good. Do you want some tea? No, thank you. Listen, I'm going to take the painting home with me tonight and then work on the finishing touches there. Oh, okay. Do you think you're going to be done in time? Yeah, absolutely. But you won't be coming by tomorrow? Uh, no, I think you should probably be with your family. Let them know how you feel about selling the house. - Yeah, sure. - I don't wanna be in the way. Plus, it'll ruin the surprise. Yeah. Yeah, I guess you're right. Yeah, but... you could call me or text me and let me know how it's going. Okay, I'll do that. Okay. So I guess I'll see you Christmas Eve? Yeah, I'll see you Christmas Eve. Don't look at it. - Hey! - Hi! - Merry Christmas! - Merry Christmas! - How was the drive? - Not too bad. So how are you? You look great. I'm so glad you're here. - Hey, Margot. - Hey, Jeff. Hey! Hi, Aunt Margot! I'm so glad you could make it! I'm going to go check out the fort in the cedar bush. - Can you believe this wind? - Oh, my gosh. What is it? Uh... deja vu. Christian and I were that exact same age when we... Have you seen him? Yeah. Well? Enough already. Spill it! - Not right now. - Come on. - Hey, Ace, honey! - What? Come on, let's wait till we unpack, okay? Aw, Mom! Come on. Don't worry. I got these. Whoa. - Margot, you did all this? - Yep. It's mostly our old decorations mixed in with a few new ones. Yeah, and all the poinsettias on Cape Cod. It looks really wonderful. Boy, if Mom and Dad could see this. Oh, Grandma's Santas! I always loved these. What's the big deal? Well, Grandma Mary used to collect Santas, and then she passed them down to our mom, your grandma, Angie. Oh, we should continue that tradition. Whoa. Am I in the wrong place? Is this the North Pole? - Very funny. - Lame joke, Dad. Looks great, Margot. Nice job, really. Thanks. Your rooms are all set up, if you want to take your luggage up. Alright, thanks. You've become quite the hostess, haven't you? Just trying to make a good impression. Oh, I've been meaning to read your last book. We've just been so busy with Ace's hockey. Oh, that's okay. Don't worry about it. - Is something burning? - The cookies! No, no, no, no, no! Ahh! - Everything okay? - I burned the cookies! Don't worry about it. No, I want everything to be perfect. Everything's great. You okay? You seem off. Yeah, everything's fine. I just... I'll tell you about it later. It's okay. You go up, get settled. Okay, well, don't worry about the cookies. I like mine a little crunchy anyway. Me, too. Have you heard anything from Tom? No, nothing. He's supposed to arrive tomorrow, but who knows? But forget about him. Tell me about Christian. I haven't heard that name in years. Boy, did you have a crush on him. - Was it that obvious? - Obvious? The whole town knew it. Oh, get out of here. So what's he doing now? He's an artist. He just opened a gallery in town. Wow. Is he single? Yeah. So... what are you waiting for? It's not that simple. We were just kids. You can't relive the past. Why not? Oh, must be the Chinese food. - Hong Kong Cafe. - Hi, thank you. Thanks. Have a good night. Dinner is here! This looks great, Margot. - It's really good. - Yeah, this is awesome. I slaved. Here, I'll pass that down to you. I'd like to make a toast. - Ooh, okay. - Okay. I would like to propose a toast to Margot, for putting this all together and making our last Christmas here so special. This is really a great tribute to Mom and Dad. To Margot! - To Margot. - To Margot. Cheers. Margs, what is it? I came here knowing that this would be our last Christmas at this house and here on the Cape. But after I got here and saw how final all this was, I realized how much I really don't want to sell this house. Margot. We have so many memories here. I don't want to let that go. Well, Jeff, you want to chime in? It's not really my place. I thought you knew this was for the best. Is it though? Margs, we could really use the money. I mean, we have college to think about. Right, but it's not just about the money for me. This place will fall apart if no one's here to maintain it. Who's going to take care of it when you go back to Boston? I don't know. I haven't got that far in my thinking yet. Well, it sounds like you haven't thought this through at all, that you're just basing it on emotion. And what's wrong with that? It's too expensive to keep. The property taxes alone. I mean, look, the realtor already has a buyer lined up. All we have to do is sign the papers. I love this house and I don't want to sell it. Margot. We already lost Mom and Dad. How can you let this place go too? Of course I miss Mom and Dad, but I was really hoping not to have this kind of conversation. Avoiding a conversation is not the way to solve a problem. Okay, think practically. Both Tom and I believe that this is the best thing for all of us. You know what? Christmas isn't the time for practicality. If you'll excuse me, I'm going for a walk. ♪ Oh, come all ye faithful ♪ Joyful and triumphant ♪ Oh, come ye, oh, come ye to Bethlehem ♪ ♪ Come and behold him ♪ Born the king of angels ♪ Oh, come, let us adore him ♪ Oh, come, let us adore him ♪ Oh, come, let us adore him, Christ, the Lord ♪ ♪ Sing, choirs of angels ♪ Sing in exultation ♪ Sing, all ye citizens of heaven above ♪ ♪ Glory to God ♪ Glory in the highest ♪ Oh, come, let us adore him ♪ Oh, come, let us adore him Margot? Hey. Oh, honey. Come on in. Hey, you still awake? Yeah. What you reading? Aunty Margot's book. Cool. What do you think? Why was she so upset tonight at dinner? She loves this house and doesn't want to sell it. Do you want to sell it? Well, it's not really up to me. It's up to your mother and her siblings. I don't have to go to college, Dad. I want to keep the house, too. Did you read all the way to the end of the book? Yeah. Read me the last couple of pages. "A home is more than bricks and blocks" and windows and locks. A home is more than a bed or where you rest your head. They say that home is where the heart is, and Caroline knew that to be true. "What she didn't realize is that your home is within you." And what does that mean to you? I guess that no matter where you go, you take your home with you? That's right. We'll always have the memories of this place in our hearts, and we'll always have each other, no matter where we go, especially at Christmas time. I still don't want to sell the house, Dad. I know. You get some sleep. - Good night, champ. - Good night, Dad. - Hey. - Hey. Can we talk? Sure. Why don't you sit down? - So I... - Look... I shouldn't have run out on you like that. I did a lot of thinking while you were gone. No, no, no. You were right. I've decided to agree to sell the house. It's the practical thing to do. What? It's just a house. It's not my family. You are my family. That's right, we are, and we love you. We can have Christmas anywhere. But why the sudden change? I think that the House helped me to feel connected to Mom and Dad, but you can't relive the past. I know that now. You can remember it fondly, but you can't relive it. Well, you have us, and we're your connection to Mom and Dad and all the amazing memories that we have. I'm just having a hard time letting go. It's totally understandable. But I'll be okay. Well, while you were gone, I read your book "Homesick," and you talk about a home not defining you, that your home is within you. I guess it's hard to practice what you preach sometimes. You have given us such an amazing Christmas gift this year, just making it all so special. Hey, let's... Let's not spoil it, okay? Okay. In my head, I know you're right. It's just my heart, you know? Yeah, I know. I want you to have that money for Ace and his college and for your family. It's important. I'm going to head off to bed. It's been a long day. Okay, sleep tight. Love you, sis.

Alright, your turn. - Hi. - Hi, is Margot here? - I'm... - Christian Williams. - Yeah. How'd you know? - I remember you. - Come on in. - Thanks, Margot. Hey. I brought you guys some Christmas cookies from that new bakery in town. - Oh, thank you. - Best on the Cape. So nice of you. Thanks. Ace, why don't you you come help me get lunch organized? So it's, uh, it's all done. I think you're really gonna like it. Thank you. Really. So how'd dinner go last night? Did you get her to agree not to sell the house? I changed my mind. I decided I'm going to let them sell it. - Really? - Yeah. I was being selfish. They could use the money, and I was just holding on to old memories. Surprised to hear you say that. I think reality finally set in. Hey, did I... do something to upset you, because you seem angry with me. No. Margot. Talk to me. What? - I saw you. - You saw me what? Last night, at the restaurant, I saw you. That. And I mean, I have no right to be mad. It's your life, you've traveled all over the world, and it would be naive to think that you and I could even possibly... I mean, what we had was when we were kids. - It's so long ago. - Margot. And it's none of my business. It's just that I was caught by surprise - and I was hurt. - Margot! - But I'm fine. - Margot, that was my sister. - What? - Yeah, that was my sister. She's in town for a few days before Christmas. She leaves for New York to see her fiance today. Oh. I feel like an idiot. Listen, there is no other woman in my life, and ever since I saw you a few days ago at the bookstore, I haven't been able to think about anybody but you. - Really? - Really. But it is kind of cute. - What? - You were jealous. Yeah. That means you care. - I do. - Yeah. - Christian. - Hmm? Would you like to join us for dinner tonight? We're going to the Christmas stroll after. I would love to. Did I interrupt something? Kinda. Okay, we'll see you later then. Okay, what time should I be back for dinner? - 5:00. - Yeah, 5:00 is great. Okay. Thank you for the invite. Are you sure you want me to come back for dinner? - Yes, absolutely. - Okay. I just have to take care of a few things. - Okay. - Okay. And I am really sorry for the misunderstanding. I never meant to hurt you. No, I'm the one who should be apologizing to you. I'm not normally like this, I swear. I just... I have a lot going on right now. I know. I hope you like the painting. Oh, wow. Hi, you've reached Judith! Unlike most people, I still listen to voice messages, so why don't you leave me one? Hey, Judith, it's Margot. You mentioned that I needed some more international recognition as an author. I'm not saying it's a done deal, but I might have the opportunity to have Christian Williams illustrate my next book. I was just wondering what that would mean in terms of an advance. Thanks. Oh, and merry Christmas. I can't believe you guys are leaving tomorrow. I know. Jeff's parents are dying to see Ace. I bet. He's the best. Hey, thanks for making this so special. Let's enjoy our last night here as a family, though, okay? Deal. It's been so great hanging out with you. We shouldn't let it go so long next time. - Yeah. - Once we sell the house, I'll be able to afford to come visit you more in Boston. That'd be great. So... what was going on with you and Christian? Well, nothing. I just made a total idiot of myself. - How? - Well... I saw him out last night with another woman. Turns out, it was a sister. Oh boy. - And you thought... - Yeah. You're such a drama queen. - Hi. - Hi. - Come in. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. - I brought you guys wine. Oh, awesome. Wow. I'm going to go let this baby breathe. Okay. Do you want to take off your coat? Yes, please. Wow. You look amazing. You don't look too bad yourself. - Thanks. - Come on. Christian, it's a pleasure having you here. Oh, thank you. This all looks delicious. Margot really stepped up to the plate this year with all the cooking and decorating. Hello! - Tom! - Whoa! Merry Christmas! Oh, my gosh! We didn't think you were coming! I couldn't not show up on our last Christmas in this house. Come on, Uncle Tom. Dinner's getting cold. - Whoa. - Merry Christmas, Tom. Merry Christmas, everyone. - Hey, I know this pot roast. - Mm-hmm. Let me do the honors. It's so good to see you, Tom. I can't believe all you've done to this place. I haven't seen the house look this Christmas-y since we were kids. I can't believe you came. Wow. My reputation's that bad, huh? I'm just glad to see you. Well, I canceled the last leg of my trip and hopped on a flight standby. I would have called, but I thought a surprise would be more fun. Yeah, it was a great surprise. Christian, what a blast from the past. I think the last time I saw you, Margot was all gaga, chasing you around. I was not gaga. What was that old Paul Anka song, "Puppy Love." Stop it. No, it's been really nice getting reacquainted. Oh, so I brought the papers from the realtor for everyone to sign for the house. - We can deal with that later. - Excuse me for a moment. Uh, what'd I say? She's just taking it harder than the rest of us. - Hmm. - Is she okay? I don't know. So, Christian, how long have you been back on the Cape? A couple of months. Is it the same as you remember? With age comes perspective, so I have to say it's better. I just wanted to say that this has been one of the best Christmases that I've had in a really long time. Ever since Mom and Dad died, I got so focused on my career and then this house that I didn't take any time to focus on all of you, my family. I came back here and I ran into Christian and found out that he was an artist. Well, actually, you've been an artist your whole life, ever since we were kids. But it turns out that you're quite the famous artist. But of course, you being you, you didn't say anything about that. Anyway, I had Christian paint you a Christmas present, Meredith. Wow. Wow! - It's beautiful, Christian. - That's... that's incredible. I want you to know I'm okay with selling the house. I wasn't initially, but I'll sign whatever paperwork you need me to sign before you go. I just wanted you to have something to remember the place by. It's so lovely. Really. Thank you, Margot. But I really feel like you should keep the painting. Absolutely not. It's yours. Margs, I had no idea he didn't want to sell, but I'm glad you're okay with it. Me, too. Okay, so I know I haven't been around much, but I'm going to make it my Christmas promise to try and make you guys more of a priority. You better. Who's ready for the Christmas stroll? - Yeah! - Yes, let's roll. ♪ Hark, the herald angels sing ♪ ♪ Glory to the newborn king ♪ Peace on Earth and mercy mild ♪ ♪ God and sinner reconciled ♪ Joyful, all ye nations rise ♪ Join the triumph of the skies ♪ ♪ With angelic hosts proclaim ♪ Christ is born in Bethlehem ♪ Hark, the herald angels sing ♪ Glory to the newborn king ♪ Hail the heavenly Prince of Peace ♪ You know, you really are quite the artist. And you are quite the writer. No, I mean it. Even before I knew it was you, I was drawn to your work. And then Jacklyn said that you had a reputation and I was worried you were a ladies man, a Casanova. Hardly. But that does explain a lot. Well, then I looked you up and it turns out that you do have a reputation... A worldwide reputation. - You didn't know that? - Mnh-mnh. Not before last night. You're kidding. I thought that's why you wanted me to paint your house. No, I wanted you to paint the house because I like your work and I kind of like you. - Where are we going? - Come with me. - Thank you. - You're welcome. The carolers were really good this year. They were. What are we doing? Oh, well, it is time to make good on your end of the bargain. - What? - Oh, I want to draw you again. I don't know what to do. I feel so awkward. No, you're just going to sit right over here. Yep. Perfect. Down there. And then talk to me. - I look a mess. - No, you look beautiful. This is so uncomfortable. No, this is perfect. Tell me a story. Tilt your chin just a little bit up. Can I look yet? It's almost done. Ugh, the anticipation is killing me. Patience. - Oh, one sec. - Yeah, go ahead. Hi, Judith. - Margot, it's Judith. - I know. Who else is working at 9:00 on Christmas Eve? - It's my agent. - Oh, okay. I got your message and I ran your idea about Christian Williams illustrating your new book up the flagpole. - And? - The publishers love it. Christian's global fan base could mean big business for us. It's a whole different audience. Wow, that's fantastic. And they're willing to offer you a six-figure advance. What? That's incredible. I figured that was news worth sharing on Christmas Eve. Is it ever? W... Thank you, Judith. We'll sort out the details after the holidays. Yes, of course, yeah. That is one heck of a Christmas gift. - Merry Christmas, doll. - Merry Christmas. What? Come on, now the anticipation is killing me. I think I have a way of buying out my siblings and keeping the house. How? Oh, my gosh. This is unbelievable. Um... Christian, that was my agent. Yeah, I know. You said that. What did she say? I sort of bounced the idea off of her about the possibility of you illustrating my next book. I see. And she just told me that the publishing company loves that idea and they'd be willing to give me... us... They'd be willing to give us a big advance. If you're interested, of course. I don't know, uh... I've never illustrated a children's book before. I know, but you're going to be amazing. I know it. It's... That's beautiful. Yeah, do you think I have the chops? You definitely have the chops. And... I'd be honored to illustrate your children's book with you. - Really? - Really. - Really? - Really. - Oh. - Thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. You've no idea how much this means to me. Oh, I think I have an inkling. This has been the most wonderful Christmas, but I have one more gift for both of you. No more gifts. You've given us enough already. You sure have. This has been the perfect goodbye to this place. And now I don't have to leave Harbour Island anymore when it's freezing cold up here. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. - Hey, am I too late? - No, no, no. I just gave them their presents. Come in. Open them up! Open them up! Margs. What's going on? Open your present. I want to buy the house. I'll give both of you full market value for your third. Christian and I just got quite a lucrative deal for a new children's book, which I'll write and he'll illustrate. It's called "The Family Tree," and it's about a giant red beech tree that grows in the yard of a very special Cape Cod home. The tree, in its quiet wisdom, is the guiding force for the generations of family that live in this house. My Christmas wish is that you'll allow me to be the steward of this place and keep it in the family because we, this family, are what make a house a home. Jeez. Wow. Does this mean we're keeping the house, Dad? It means Auntie Margot's keeping the house, but I'll bet she'll let us visit. Anytime you want. So is that a yes? - Yes! - Yes! You better come back next year, Tom. I wouldn't miss it. Hey, I'm proud of you, sis. You made it happen, and nothing makes me happier than keeping this house in the family. - I love you. - Love you, too. See you, Tom. You better take good care of this house. - You hear me? - I will. You know I will. Well, actually, go ahead and trash it. It's yours now. No, it's still all of ours. I'm just paying the mortgage now. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. Thanks, Margot. That was wonderful. Happy New Year, Aunt Margot. I'm glad you're keeping the house. Me, too. - Nice to meet you, Christian. - See you. Drive safe, guys. - Hey, you. - Hey. C'mere, I have something for you. - What, why? - 'Cause it's Christmas. No, you've given me so much already. Come on. - What is this? - Just sit. Merry Christmas. You kept it, after all this time? Of course I did. And it led me home, just like you said it would.
