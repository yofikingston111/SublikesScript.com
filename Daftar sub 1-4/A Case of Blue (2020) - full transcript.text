What, no belly dancers this time? And where is everyone else? Well you got me, old friend. Oh, right. I'm good, thanks. Come on, I'll drive you home. And leave all of this. I'll have Charlie, Jamie and Georgia pack it all up and bring it over later. Listen, by the time we kill the champagne, I don't think you should let me back in the car. Oh, geez, you're not spending the night. I'm sorry. I draw the line. Why? I mean, you're walking to... It's our thousandth date. Surprise! Oh my God. Give me a heart attack. Happy retirement, Sweetheart. Did we surprise you, Grandpa? You sure did, Kiddo. Happy retirement, Dad. Richard, congratulations. Thanks. I'm really gonna miss working for you, Richard. Greta, don't get all mushy on me, come on. Oh, I'm not. Oh you sneaky son of a... All I said was no belly dancers this time. Whoa. Oh. Let's start this party. Yeah! Yeah, Richard. 70 is the new 50, Richard, congratulations. - Whoa. - Oh. That was a close call. Nice reaction time. I also have a very impressive backhand. I can see that. Have we met? Dad, this is Annie. She lives a couple doors down from me. Her grandson plays with Sabrina. Hello. Congratulations on your retirement, Richard. Thank you. It was really nice to meet you, Annie. Excuse me. Aha, yes. Every retiree needs this. A user manual for retirement. You're next. No, no. Oh, Richard, this is from me... to you. Oh my. What you get him, Greta, a bazooka? Hey, Kenny, ba-boom. Can't take you anywhere. Oh. Be gracious. Now I know you don't fish, but I figure you'll have the time. Oh, he'll be fishing all right. Like Ahab and the whale. You read my mind, Greta. Thank you. Here. Here, Dad. We thought it was time for you to, uh, you know, rekindle an old passion. Ah. Here's something to go with it, Grandpa. What's that, Sweetie? What is it, Richard? It's a gift card for life drawing classes. Dad used to draw before he went to business school. We thought you could pick it back up again. Drawing nudes, now that's a gift. Do you like it, Grandpa? It's great. Mommy, what's a nude. You were quiet tonight. Who needs to be loud when you got your friend around. I know. I know, Kenny's just sad. Sad? More like... jilted. I don't think his wife would appreciate that description. Do you think she'd even notice? No, I'm just talking about how he's gonna cope, now that his only buddy's no longer at the office. He'll manage. You don't have to do that. And have you be a walking fashion disaster? Not while I'm here. Tell me I did the right thing. That I made the right choice. Can I get some soda, please? Sure, why not? Yay! Oh come on, grandfather's prerogative. Oh sure, let's see how that flies with Chelsea. She still hasn't gotten over the buttons. The buttons? Yes, the buttons. What you renamed those french fries for our granddaughter at age three so she wouldn't give away what you fed her. Oh those buttons. Oh those buttons. Hey, Kiddo, I don't think it's such a good idea after all. How about you take an extra ride on the flying horses instead? All right? Okay. Oh you're such a good kid. Join me, Grandpa. I'll be right over there taking pictures. Okay. What? I need you to participate. I just don't think it's a good time, Hon. Well it's never gonna be a good time. Hello. Hey. Mm, I think that's enough screen time for both of you. Aw, but we didn't get all the candy. My biggest regret was your ever getting that darn thing. All right, all right. Reading practice for you. There's a desk in my old bedroom. I thought you'd be all over this. Everything worked out okay at the park? Oh yeah, she's crazy about that carousel. You didn't feed her any of that junk they sell, did you? How could you even ask me that? I have no idea, Mr. Buttons. I told you. I've reformed. Well, on that note, I'm going to go check on her. So, what's up? You two look like you're about ready to make a corporate pitch. No. We've actually been talking, and wanted to share this with you. It's 10 minutes from here, and there'd be no more worrying about the snow and the upkeep of the house and all the space that you don't need. You should see the courts they've got, Richard, both indoors and out, cement and clay. Yeah, this is a one-minute stroll from where you'd be living. We think this could be a win-win. A win-win? Dad, I think it'd be a good change. This is home. Let's take a drive, hmm, check it out. I'm good. We can register now. I think you've done enough already. Hey. Both of you, stop. I tried to tell you. I'm gonna get some air. I'll be upstairs. Dad. What do you want from me? I know this is a tough transition, but you gotta talk to me. I am talking. What else do you want me to say? You're keeping it bottled up. It's not healthy. Kiddo, I appreciate your concern, but I'm fine, really. I'll go get Sabrina. She's right, you know? Ellie, we're fine. Oh will you stop that? Stop what? Stop pretending to be this Rock of Gibraltar. I'm not the Rock of- I just don't express every last feeling I have like some of us. Oh. And another ulcer is born.

But trapped in this decrepit body. Oh, oh now, that's yummy. You're gonna get arrested for lewd thoughts. If that was a crime, the whole male population of this city would be stuffed into Rikers. At least that's where our wives woulda stuck us. Richard, hang in there. We're all just passing through, aren't we? Yeah. Well. More like, um, passing gas. Oh my God, oh stop, please. Jesus. Well then you stop with that circle of life Lion King horse shit. So, why don't you tell me how it went this morning? Some nice views? Jesus, Kenny, it's not like it's a goddam peep show. Well? I don't think you'd have found it titillating. Okay, I get it. You're doing it for the art. That's good. That's good. You used to be big into drawing, right? You wanted to be an artist or something? Yeah, and then I found my true calling. So how does your hand feel after three hours of drawing? A little sore. Sore? That's all you can say, is sore? Well that's what you always say when you come home from skating. Oh, are you comparing drawing with my axel jumps? Well, no, but. You better not. Anyway, I'm glad you're back at it, and I hope it's helping. Aw. Okay, okay. Good morning.

Just wanted to see what my drawings looked like way back when? Oh, and? Lucky for us I chose accounting instead. Have a good run. How could it be her? Come on. I don't know, but the drawing is, was, of her. Am I losing my mind, Kenny? Sometimes I imagine things, you know. Imagine? Like what? Nothing, nothing. So you're saying this is the same girl you told me about? The one you nearly threw it all away for? Jesus H, this is some serious Twilight Zone shit. You're not helping. What do you want me to say? I don't know. Oh my God, what would Ellie think? She'd think you retired too soon. Seriously. Did you ever tell her about this girl? Maybe in passing. I certainly never expounded on the details. Wise man. So what do I do? About what? This girl? Who am I to judge? Follow your fucking heart. Oh, oh, oh, that's it. There? Right there, yes, that's where it is. Oh. Better? Uh-huh. That's why I married you. Well, that and reaching the top shelf. It's lucky I can do this too. Otherwise, you might consider replacing me with a stepladder. Believe me, I've considered it. Hey, do you remember that girl I told you about a long time ago, the one just before business school? The model in class yesterday looked exactly like her. That's funny. I thought so too. And... stop. We'll take a five-minute break before our final pose of the morning. Wow, I really love what you do with my eyes. Can I see? It's, that's not how I posed. I have to leave. I have to go, I'm sorry. Uh, for our final pose this morning, we'll just be having one model, so please adjust your easel if necessary. What the hell you doing, Richard? I don't know. Jesus, pull your shit together here. I'm trying to. Look, I don't know why she reacted that way. She coulda just said, nice drawing or some crap like that. None of this makes any sense. Look, where is this drawing anyway? Let me see it. I threw it away. You. Aw, man, what are you doing? You told me to follow my heart. Now first off I told you to follow your fucking heart. And secondly, that didn't include acting like a schmuck. So what should I do? Well here's some sage advice, you ready? At the next class, you simply introduce yourself to this poor girl and you apologize for freaking her out previously. You just say that she looks a lot like someone you were once in love with. Now, okay, okay, scrap that last part. Just keep the resemblance thing. Okay? Think you can do that? Yeah. I'll send you my consultation bill later. Look, I know you've been through a lot, but you're gonna be okay. I'll see at our usual time on Saturday, hmm? Drinks after on me. Now go and retrieve that drawing, because that was really dumb. Oh. You didn't? I did. You did. What do you think? I think you know it's my favorite. You know, the chicken is your grandmother's recipe. - Yeah? - Yeah. Yeah, she gave it to me. Oh, I know. You wanna tell me about your day? Same old same old. Well I just found out something. The competition that I thought was gonna be canceled this weekend in Westchester is on. That's good. So, if you wanna come. Don't say it. Oh, baby, you know on Saturdays I have... Ellie. Just think about it a little bit more, okay, please? Do you want me to get your skates sharpened? No, I got it covered. All right. Excuse me. Can you tell me the name of the woman who modeled here yesterday? I'm afraid it's school policy not to give out that information, you understand, right? Oh sure. Can you at least tell me when she's scheduled to come in again? I can't do that. Okay, is there a way to get a note to her? I'm sorry.

Carey, Carey, Carey. I'm getting the point. Carey, I told you I'd handle it. I was protecting you. Yeah, well, I didn't ask you to. What do you want? I just wanted to talk to you. Why? Because you look exactly like someone I once knew. My grandmother? That's who you're talking about, right, Marcy? Yes. Yeah, well, she didn't like being harassed, and I don't like being harassed either. I don't harass people. Dude, you're a fucking pervert. Chill. That's not how it was. How's she doing? She isn't. Marcy's dead? Oh. I'm sorry. I won't bother you ever again. Hey. I like your drawings. What? I was in the cafe across the street when you threw them out, and I can give them back to you if you want. I had actually gone back there to retrieve them. All right, well, meet me at Cafe Reggio tomorrow at noon, and I'll bring them. Hey, what's your name? Amelia. Amelia. Amelia. ♪ She lives in my dreams ♪ ♪ She lives in my song ♪ ♪ She's lived here forever ♪ ♪ She's never gone ♪ ♪ She lives in my dreams ♪ ♪ She lives in my dreams ♪ ♪ She lives ♪ Well look who showed up.

Lucky me. Look, I just. I can't do this anymore. - Hey. - Hi. I don't know if you think I rescued these or I stole it, but there you go. Thank you. Can you sit? Um. What do you wanna talk about? I just, um. My God. I don't know. It's amazing, I just feel like I'm in sort of a strange time warp. Because I look just like her? Oh God, yeah. You know how creepy this is, right? I never thought of myself that way. Well you should. Married man. Can you just tell me what happened to your grandmother? Yeah, it happened just like you said it would. Just like you told her it would happen the last time you saw her in this very spot. How did you know this? I inherited her diary. You told her she was doomed. Doomed to be alone and drunk in some dim cafe. And that's exactly what happened. I'm sorry. I'm sorry things turned out that way for her. Yeah, well, I gotta go. Oh please don't, just another minute. Why? The past is dead, Richard. I don't think she shared everything that happened in that diary. Please, don't go. Did she say why I said those things? Yeah, you, um, you didn't like her bohemian ways, and you were jealous of her modeling, so you dumped her like a bad penny. That's not exactly how it went down. Okay, so how did it? It was just a difference in philosophy. No one was a bad guy. You broke her heart. And she broke mine. She didn't wanna be monogamous, and I couldn't. I just couldn't. I've always been old-fashioned that way, so I let her go. Were you happy with your choice? For the most part, yes, but it was painful for me too. So then what did you do? Went to business school. Mm, you were such a square. Yeah, I did all the square stuff. Yeah. Yeah, got married, suburb, kid. So on. Sounds like a good life. It was. Is. Can I get something for you? No thank you. Okay, look, I have to go meet or pick up a client's dog. Um, for a walk. And you are welcome to accompany me, if you want. I could use the exercise. Awesome. So what else can you tell me about your grandmother? Well, I guess after you dumped her she moved upstate in New York to a commune. And then about a year later, she had my mom, which she really could not handle, and that messed my mom up. And then when my mom was 20, she pretty much did the same thing with me. So, it's all screwed up. Yo, yes, that's what I'm talking about, Daddy. Love the trumpet. Big guns. Big guns, what's that? Nothing. What is that? What's big guns. Your grandmother used to shout exactly like that. Really? Yeah. What's the origin of big guns? I don't think you need to know that. No, come on, you can tell me. I'm a big girl. Maybe another time. Go, Granny, that's hot. Mm-hmm. All right, I just need to get my keys, and my hat. You live here? Yeah. Something else I inherited from Big Guns. You can come up, if you want. Just give me one second. You're an artist. Yeah, of course, I can't let you have all the fun. I see you like working in the style of Picasso. Um, it's more like Gilot. Gilot, who's that? Francoise Gilot, she's one of my heroes. You listen to vinyl. Yeah, I got the sickest collection from my grandmother. You ready? Now, I hope you like dogs. Because you're about to meet Roadie. - Roadie? - Yeah. He's a nut.

Besides the giant paycheck? All right. Um. I don't know. I think that. I think that it's ...it's freeing. Like I can feel my feet on the ground. I can just feel all this space around. I can breathe. You know, it's kinda hard to describe but my grandma wrote it was like the loving caress of a dozen hands all over your body. Like nothing sexual, just loving. And I get that, I do. It's spiritual, you know. It's spiritual, and I think everyone should try it. I think you should try it. Oh no way. Yeah, I think you definitely should. Everyone but me. Roadie, come on back. - Where'd he go? - Roadie! - Roadie! - Roadie! Man, where could he be? You know, I'm gonna lose my job if we don't find him. Hi, excuse me, have you guys seen a golden retriever? Okay, thank you. Roadie! - Roadie! - Roadie! Come here. Have you seen a dog run past here? - Roadie! - Roadie! Roadie! Come here, Roadie! Amelia, you take the right path, and I'll circle around, meet you back at the lawn where we were. Roadie! We'll find him. Hey, guys, have you seen a dog come by here? Roadie! Roadie? Oh my God. You found him. Thank you so much. Roadie, Roadie, what were you doing? What were you doing, Baby? What were you doing, you silly, Roadie? Actually, he'd run all the way past Poet's Corner, and I- - Thank you so much. You okay? When I was a kid, we had a mutt that we rescued. He was my best friend. Lot of energy. And my mother always told me to latch the gate to the backyard, and one day I forgot. And he took off. I remember running around the neighborhood screaming his name until I had no more voice. Did you ever find him? Well, you redeemed yourself today. - You ready? - Yeah. Come on, come on. Come on.

Awesome, if you just wanna come over to my place around nine, you can meet us. You don't want an old guy like me spoiling your fun. Come on. I think I, um. I think I need to go. All right.

Where did you find these guys? Ooh, I don't know. Vincent and Saurab both come from really strict families, who didn't know what to do with them. And then I introduced them, and now they're okay. Adriel was strumming in Washington Square Park, and no one was listening to him. I was like, are these people stupid? So I became his biggest fan. And Carey, well, you remember Carey. Carey's always on fire about something. I mean, he doesn't, okay, he doesn't like to talk about it, but his, um, dad went to jail for beating his mom. So I think that's why he's a little overprotective with me and overreacted to you. Willy is a recovering financial adviser who does these incredible chalk drawings.

Hey, yo, make sure your catheter don't fall out. Nursing home's a block away. Are we sure this guy's dancing, or is he just having a seizure? Yo, Grandpa, your leg okay? I'm gonna catch my breath, okay? You good? Everything okay? You having fun? Okay. Richard, hey, Richard. Hey. What's going on? I shouldn't be here. What happened? Just go back to your fun with Carey. Oh my God. Are you jealous? I gotta go. No, no no no, wait, wait. Before you go, I wanna give you something. What? Not here, come on, let's just go upstairs. Come on, please. Please, Richard. Sorry, thank you. Spectacular. All right, close your eyes. Stick out your hand. My God, you're so trusting. My grandma had that in this drawer with all her other keepsakes. It's yours, right? Yeah, it's mine. Yeah. She bought this for me. From the Moroccan guy on St. Mark's Place. Spoke five languages fluently. I remember when she put it on me. She threw it over my neck, and she kissed me. I think she'd be happy to know that you're reunited with it now. Shall I? You're so formal. It looks good. Are you okay? Just give me a second. I didn't mean to overwhelm you with like the party and the scarf. It's okay, Marcy, I'm fine. You're fine? You okay? Uh-huh. We should get outta here. What do you wanna do? I wanna go draw. That's a great idea. Okay. Let's go. Whoo. I'm gonna go get ready. All right. Do you want me to start setting anything up? Yeah, if you want to, thank you. Self-portraits are great. Uh-huh. They can be tricky, though. It's a great test of your objectivity, you know? Eyes look good. Oh yeah. Whoa, you're doing the guys? Yeah, it's part of a series. Yeah, I especially like the one of Carey. You ready? Yeah. That's what you're wearing? Mm-hmm. I think it would be best if you stood over there. Uh. You're sketching me? Yeah. Yeah. Oh. Was that not, that wasn't cl- No, it wasn't. Are you okay with that? Yeah, why not? Where do you want me? Um, hmm. I think right here is good. All right. Okay. You don't have to take everything off, if you're not comfortable with it too. I just wanted to do a portrait. Equal opportunity. Let's do it. Okay. I feel a little nervous. Okay. Okay. Thank you. I see what you mean about the sound. Mm-hmm. How do you feel? I don't know. Well? You wanna see? Can I? That's how you see me? Richard. That's how you are. Oh. I, I, I. I can't do this. Well it's not like you're going, right? Ellie, you know I have my weekly match with- Ellie. It's fine. I don't need you to come. Now you're sounding like me. Anyway, I'd probably screw up my jump, knowing you were there in the bleachers, just scrutinizing my every move. It would be very distracting. Richard, family. The past is dead. I know this is a tough transition, but you gotta talk to me. Stop pretending to be this Rock of Gibraltar. You're keeping it bottled up. It's not healthy. Wake up, Grandpa? Oh. What time is it? It's the afternoon. Give me a few more minutes, will ya, Kiddo? Come on, Grandpa. A few more minutes. Grandpa won't wake up, Mommy. Here. Go play downstairs. What are you doing? Put them back, right now! Chelsea. She's gone, Dad. It's been a whole year, you gotta stop pretending. I'm not pretending. And have you be a walking fashion disaster? Not while I'm here.
