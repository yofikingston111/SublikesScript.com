"Do you believe in love at first sight?" "Me neither." Those were the words that started the whole Emma Gale success story. And for 20 years and 12 novels, it seemed like nothing could go wrong. Until now. Hello, Ms. Brown. Welcome to The Drew Barrymore Show. Thank you. Can't I just go home and wait until this blows over? This is not blowing over. This is a Category 5. Do you know how many people hate you because of this book? Bring back Winston! A lot? It's showtime. - I thought you were my friend. - Well, right now, I'm your agent. So go out there and charm everybody's pants off. And try not to look so tall. It's intimidating. I suppose it's possible you might not have read a Sophie Brown novel, but trust me, you know somebody who has, and, boy, do I have some questions for her. Hm. Join us in welcoming back my good friend and best-selling author, Sophie Brown! Thank you. Oh, thank you. - Hi. - Hi. Thank you for having me. I'm surprised I made it in alive. I barely did. All of you viewers, if you wonder what we're talking about, I'd say that Sophie Brown has a whole lot of unhappy fans out there. Well, I think you might mean former fans. Well, I guess we're all wondering about the ending of your latest book. I know that the character of Winston charmed many of the readers. Then why in the world would you kill him? The readers, they loved Winston. Maybe they just didn't know him like I did. We don't always get the happy ending. You know, I normally don't do this, but I have got to agree with the fans out there. He didn't deserve to fall down the stairs. So you're on their side? Well, you murdered a man that I was in love with. I mean, what gives you the right to take him away? Well, I'm... I'm the author. I know, but perhaps you're having a hard time separating your real life from the fiction in your books. - What? - Well, you've had a rough year. Your husband left you. You had a very messy divorce. Okay, but Winston is a fictional character. - Was he? - Yes. And you should be happy that it was a quick death, yeah, because I could have extended it for ten pages. I could have dragged him behind a car. I could have poisoned him with mercury. I could have chopped him into little, teeny pieces and fed him to the sharks! We'll be right back. I became a writer so I could write in my pajamas, not so I could get yelled at by strangers. I thought you became a writer because of Grandpa. You used to sit in the barbershop and listen to his stories, right? Yeah. About the castle. - About Scotland. - Mm. He had told me that he snuck in once. Yep. He told that one a lot. Are you sure you're gonna be okay? 'Cause I can come back next weekend. Absolutely not. You stay at school. Don't worry about me. I got this. Okay. I need to forget about the Emma Gale fiasco for a while. I need to go away. Dun Dunbar. The castle. I'll go to Scotland. It's hidden away, and it's quiet, and nobody knows me there. Mom, this is great. You're finally taking a vacation. Not a vacation. A working trip. Just until the bad press dies down. I can write the new Emma Gale, bring Winston back, and everything will be back to normal. All right, well, at least promise me you'll see the castle. I promise. That's me. Ah, you're American. Yes. Nobody told me that. Whereabouts? Uh-huh. Where are you from? No. No. This is all the luggage I have. - It's not a problem. - Oh.

May I help you? I'm checking in. Very good. Follow me. Isn't that Sophie Brown? In our wee village? Dinna be daft. - Welcome to the village inn. - Thank you. I have a reservation under Sophie Brown. Sophie Brown, the author? Not sure I should admit it, but, uh, yes. I've read all your books. I just finished the last one. Wonderful. - May I ask you a question, then? - Sure. Why'd you leave it so long to kill off Winston? - What? - I was hoping you'd do it in volume one. I never liked that sod. Too bloody perfect. It's... You know what? I'm not so sure I did either. - Bugger. - Bugger. - I killed him off. - Good for you, Sophie Brown. Sod. Got any other names for him? Oh, it's lovely. That's very kind. I'm sure it's not what you're used to. Actually... ...it is exactly what I was hoping for. Is Dun Dunbar Castle nearby? Aye, it's just over the hill. Well, if you need anything else, Ms. Brown, just ring. Thank you. And it's Sophie. Maisie. Nice to meet you, Maisie. You too. Scotland? Really? Why didn't you clear this with me first? Because you would have talked me out of it. - How long have we known each other? - Too long. Since page one, book four. And when have I ever steered you wrong? - The title of book six. - Oh, aside from that! Don't worry. I'm here to write. Good, and when can I expect to see pages? Soon. It's practically writing itself. - Goodbye. - Bye. ♪ I remembered you older and taller ♪ ♪ But you're younger and smaller ♪ ♪ So who's gonna call her and say ♪ ♪ That you're back again? ♪ ♪ You're alone till you're not alone ♪ ♪ And that's all you need to know ♪ ♪ Every time you decide to stay ♪ ♪ Then the world will make you go ♪ ♪ And that's all you need to know ♪ Right, now, the gift shop is right here.

All with the clan coat of arms, of course. But of course. Well, may your travels be swift. Something on your mind? Several things. Aye, well, perhaps one of them could be fixing the door to the library. - It's hard to get the people in. - Aye, it's even harder to get them out. Hello there. Hi. - So you work here too? - Wherever they'll have me. You just missed the tour, but the next one's Thursday. Oh, well, um, could I just wander around a little on my own? I'm afraid that's not... It's all right, Thomas. I'll give her a tour. - I wouldn't want to get you in trouble. - Take my chances. This way. There are more than 3,000 castles in Scotland. Some date back to the 14th century. These grand old ladies hold the proud history of all those who lived, worked, and fought here. Look at that staircase. Aye, it's one of five. What's up there? Upper floors. This here is the music room where the third duchess wrote a book of poems. - Have you read it? - Aye, and I wouldn't recommend it. - So you're here for the day, then? - A little longer. Aye. Tourists don't usually stay in our village. We're more of what you call a drive-through. Oh. Dun Dunbar was built by the first Duke of Dunbar for his wife. Been in the same family for 500 years. - Who owns it now? - Just some royal arse. Hamish! Hamish. Oh my goodness. Oh! - No! No! - Okay. Hi. Never seen him like this. Have you meat in your pocket? Oh, yeah. I always carry a steak on my person. Out now. Go on. Get out. Go on! I'm sorry. It's okay. So, this is the older part of the castle. Dates back to 1500. The Dunbars had meetings of the clan and grand celebrations in here. Come on. There's more. This staircase was built clockwise. Apparently, the best way to defend by a right-handed swordsman. Hm. Hm. What's up at the top? Twelve bedrooms and ten bathrooms. Oh. Wow. I guess the, uh, royal arse needs a lot of thrones. Never enough. - Can we go up? - Sorry, not part of the tour. Can I steal you away from the tour for a moment? Can it wait? There's a couple wanting to talk about a wedding. All right. How do they look? - Like they can afford it. - Stay put. I won't be long. Top of the circular... ...staircase... ...there's a hallway. Okay. At the top of the stairs, there are three doors. One, two, three. Hello? Miss? Hello? Hello? Hello, miss? Miss? - What are you doing? - I'm sorry. I just needed to see something. And what could you possibly need to see up here? Okay, the thing is, I have a little family history in this place. - Oh, do you now? - Yes. Don't tell me. You did a DNA test, and your ancestor's Mary Queen of Scots? I said I was sorry. Do you know why no one's allowed up here? I'm guessing frostbite. Because it's someone's home. How would you like a parade of gawkers traipsing through yours? Tour's over. Uh, that'll be £20. The sign says ten. Private tour's more. Ah, I dinna have change. Well, consider it a tip for your warmth and hospitality. Well, here's a tip for you. Stay out of places you don't belong. Keep him away from people. Right. Well, we try. What was all that about? Book the wedding. "Mary Queen of Scots." - I would love to see you dance. - Well, those were the days. Go on, then. Give us a show. - Oh, I'd like to see that. - Hi. - Enjoy the castle? - I did, yes. It was magical. I love your books. - I rather love them too. - We've read every one. - I told them not to bother you. - Are you kidding? You may be the only readers left who don't hate me. So, knitting in a pub? Do you knit? Oh, no. I mean, I've always wanted to learn, but... Oh! Well, these might come in handy. Then you can join our club. Thank you. Um... Helen. I'm Sophie. Uh-huh. I'm Rhona. I'm a pastry chef, but for now, I make biscuits in the bakery across the way. Thank you. Mm. Mmm. Mm-hmm. Oh. These are... ...delicious! And this is Angus. His husband was one of the original members, but he passed on. Not long after, Angus showed up. Hasn't stopped knitting since. Here, would you like me to show you how to knit? Yes, please. Well, come on, then. - Not letting this go though. - No. Mm-mm. That is my daughter, Lexi. She's away at college now. - Oh, it's hard when they move away. - It's harder when they move back in. And your husband? Uh, it's been a year since my divorce. - Oh. - It's been four since mine. I've got a boyfriend in the bakery. - He just doesn't know it yet! - I'm still married. Although, I'm not sure he knows it either. Not true. You two are madly in love. We are. It's nice to hear him laugh like that. He hasn't spoken a word since Graham died. I still can't believe you chose our little village to write the next Emma Gale! Well, I was supposed to come here a long time ago with my dad. But he got sick, and we never made it. I'm so sorry. He lived at Dunbar Castle as a kid. Well, outside the castle. They weren't allowed inside. - His family, they were the groundskeepers. - You mean your family? My family. The McGuintys. Ah, you're one of us, then. McGuinty. I... I don't think I've heard that name around here. Well, they moved to New York when he was a boy. I was at school with a McGuinty back in the day. A real talker, that one. Always blethering and telling the tales. Callum McGuinty? That's him. Of course, we called him something else. McMotormouth. Oh, you have his smile. Oh, I don't know why I'm crying. Because these are your roots, dear. I wish I'd come back sooner. - Well, you're here now. - Mm-hmm. And you got to see Dun Dunbar while it's still a castle. - What do you mean? - It's... it's up for sale. A lot of the old castles are for sale. Aberdeenshire's cheaper than a Range Rover. And you'd be more comfortable living in a Range Rover. - Oh, Angus. - Wow. Thank you. That's great. So someone wants a trophy castle? I didn't get that feeling. It's worse, then. They wanna tear it down for condos and a golf course. Here's the offer. And it's rather large. I'm doing the tours and the gift shop. I've agreed to the weddings and... and maybe even a funeral or two. Maybe your own. Look, we've been mates for a long time. I've bent over backwards, keeping you out of foreclosure. I just need a little more time, Ian. There is no more time unless you sell off the farmlands. No, I can't do that. - Myles... - No, it's out of the question! Uh, Ms. Brown has arrived. - Sophie Brown. Myles Dunbar. - You're the royal arse? - You're the buyer? - He let me think he worked here. It is work being me. And you can't just show up and decide to buy a castle, like some hamburger. - Well, you did say it was a drive-through. - I'm not selling to her. Mr. Dunbar. Technically it's "Duke." Uh, Myles is the 12th Duke of Dunbar. Oh, well, forgive me, Your Highness. Technically, it's "Your Grace." Ah! I can think of a few other names I'd call you. And you wouldn't be the first. And FYI, the title does not come with the land. So if that's what you're after, you can buy a ladyship online for £30. The only title I'm interested in is my next book, which I'm going to write at Dun Dunbar in the library. I'm not giving up 500 years of history on someone's whim. - It is not a whim. - Oh my. What is it, then? Do you believe in love at first sight? No, I don't. Me neither. But if I did, that would be what I felt when I saw Dun Dunbar. It felt like home. Aye. My home. My father's too. On the grounds. A long time ago. - His family worked for yours. - Try again. I thought that dukes were supposed to be gentlemen. Those are English dukes. Well... ...this was clearly a mistake. - Yes, it was. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Not you. Him. You realize you just handed over Dun Dunbar to the bank? What can I get you? What do you, uh, recommend to obliterate the memory of the most awful, arrogant person you've ever met? - Got just the thing. - Mm. Thank you. Ah. Whiskey. Large. You'll keep Thomas on. What? He's lived here his whole life. I've had a change of heart. Oh, so you actually have one. If I agree to this, there are conditions. Ninety-day escrow till Christmas. Deposit's non-refundable. - What else? - You'll move in now. - Now? - Aye. - Are you moving out? - No. I am not living with you. Look, this has nothing to do with you and me. There is no you and me. Exactly. If I'm gonna sell the old girl, I need to know you can take care of her. And you need to know how hard that is. Dun Dunbar is a living, breathing thing. She needs constant attention, or she'll crumble like an oatcake in the rain. Gift shop? Two quid. I'll throw it into the deal. She'll realize the mistake she made and be gone in a week. Meanwhile, her deposit will get us through spring, and I'll figure out something after that. - And if she doesn't leave? - Oh, she'll leave. I'll make her life so miserable she'll never want to see a castle again. Aye. Well, you do have a knack of driving people away. You're still here. Aye, but you pay me. Barely. Besides, who else would put up with you? To women buying castles. To all of us. Cheers! "Slainte" is what we say in Scotland. Slainte. Okay, here goes. Oh. - Mm. - Oh! Wait, wait. I thought you said you were buying a castle. I did. Mom, are you drunk? Oh! Not anymore. I'm buying Dun Dunbar. Why? Oh, I... I can't explain it. Um, except for the fact that I think he would want me to. I can almost picture his face when I walk through that door with the key. Aw. I haven't seen you smile like this in a really long time. I know. It's like it was meant to be. Although I have to live with him till Christmas. Him? Who's him? Thank you, Eamon. Oh, Hamish! Hi, big boy. Shall I announce you? - Really? - Oh, aye. She's here! - Hello. - Hello. Here. The key to my castle. Now you get the real tour. The £20 version wasn't real? Before we get started, you should know, here on the estate, we have a community-owned wind farm where we create 70% of our energy. We also have sustainable forestry and organic farming. I'm an environmental engineer. Four years at Oxford, two years Cambridge. Oxford and Cambridge. Mm. Linen closet, water closet. - Maybe I need a map. - Gift shop, £5. King James. And this here is Flemish, 16th century. And through here, my room. I will have no reason to go in there. We agree on that. More rooms. No power, leaky roof. This one's nice. The fifth duke died in here, in that very bed. Horrible death. Ugh. There's a reason they set horror movies in castles. It leaks after every rain, and it rains 150 days a year. Plumbing's intermittent, 60 fireplaces half work, Wi-Fi is iffy, cell signal's worse. But there's running water? Aye, it runs. Oh, by the way, we don't heat the upstairs. Too costly. This way. So, you'll stay in this one. Are you sure the duke didn't die in this room, and he's still in here somewhere? Oh! Why? Is this room not up to your standards? Is there a closet? There's a chair. Bathroom? It's down the hall. Fireplace doesn't work though. I'll take it. Good. Oh, by the way, I looked up your family. There's no Brown in the records. - That's my married name. - Oh, you're married, then? Divorced. Aye, now that I can believe. Leaving so soon? Follow me. Take a look at that. What is that? My father. "McGu" is your father's name? McGuinty. He got caught before he could finish. Didn't think there was anything here I hadn't seen. When was this? Sixty years ago. He was a kid. He snuck in and made it upstairs. He just wanted someone to know he got inside. But some heartless stuffed shirt tossed him out and fired his father. - Aye, that would've been my grandfather. - Sorry. Nothing I haven't said myself. My old man wasn't much better. McGuinty, it's a strong name. You should stick with that. Hamish. What do you want? Should we go get a cup of tea? Okay. I'll follow you. Okay. Oh. We're lost, Hamish. All I want is a cup of tea. Is that too much to ask? Oh. Uh, uh... I thought that... that this was the kitchen. As long as you're here, do you mind pouring me another? Hm? - You could've locked the door. - Why? It's my house. For now. Seriously? Thanks a lot, Hamish. Be happy that it was a quick death. I could have extended it for ten pages. I could have dragged him behind a car. I could have poisoned him with mercury. I could have chopped him into little, teeny pieces and fed him to the sharks! Ooft. Where did you get that? Maisie. Page one. "Do you believe in love at first sight? I didn't used to." "I'm Emma Gale." Now, where have I heard that before? Oh, right. Your sales pitch. - I meant it. - Did you now? "The first time I laid eyes on Winston, he felt like home." - Are you gonna read the whole thing to me? - No, page one's good enough for me. May I have some coffee? Help yourself. If you are trying to discourage me, a cold room and a couple of bats in the attic are not gonna do it. - Oh, aye? - Mm. What will, then? Nothing. "'I will not be discouraged, ' said Emma. 'I will get what I came for.'"

It's a thing. Perks up the neighborhood. - How was your first night at the castle? - Cold. Well, he'll warm up. The room. Well, you're just in time to stop this massacre. Rhona wants to chop it off and dye it green. Ooh. I really hope we're talking about hair. I just need a change. Maybe I can help. I grew up over a barbershop owned by the best scissor man in Queens, and an expert colorist. Let's do it. Whoo! - So, I think a bit of color. - Okay, all right. - Helen? - Hello. Hi. Yeah, I'm gonna need your help. - Okay. - At the castle. Whoo! - Does she know we're coming? - I just texted her. Great. Oh, that is perfect. Come on, then, slow coaches. That will be lovely up there in that room. Ah, yeah, we're right behind you, Speedy Gonzales. I see you running off. Dinna hang back. Knitters to the rescue. - I've never been up the stairs before. - Well, it's clear you haven't missed much. This is perfect. - Not as perfect as my hair. - I have to admit, it does suit you. Well, this is looking rather nice. Is it? Where's the Scotch dresser? And the lamps? - I haven't the slightest. - Hm. Maybe your memory's fading. No. I remember everything. - Okay, what's with you two? - Nothing. Oh, that's been going on forever. And? Maybe we dated for a bit before I married Sean. Well, you're not married now, are you? Psh! Thank you. Oh, I don't know how to thank you. Not necessary. We knitters look after each other. No one crosses the knitters. Right, Angus? You know, I've known Myles my whole life. After you get past that upper crust, he's got a good heart. It might be hard to see right now. You couldn't find a better landlord. That's for certain. Landlord? My family has been tenants on the Dunbar land for generations. Mine too. The 11th duke squandered what remained of the family money, left Myles with an empty title, a mountain of debt, and the whole village counting on him. The whole village? It's the reason he's selling the castle. So he can pay off the debt on the farmlands. That way, whatever happens, we'll all have a place to live. Hm. Hm. Except him. Come after finals. We can have Christmas here. Oh. Mom, Dad didn't tell you. Dad didn't tell me what? He's marrying what's-her-name on Christmas. Well, good for them. I... I told him I'd go, but I really don't have to. Honey, you have to go. Is that him? Oh. Myles? Mm? This is my daughter, Lexi. Oh, uh, nice to meet you. You too. Wow. I'll call you later. Oh. Thank you. It's not for you. The damp air degrades the books. The knitters told me some things. I think maybe my first impression of you was wrong. I doubt it. So, who's what's-her-name? - So you were listening? - I may have heard a word or two. The woman for whom my husband left me. Well, you're better off, then. Obviously, he's an eejit. That actually sounded like a compliment. It's more of an insult to him. Well, I'll take it. If I'm being honest, it wasn't all his fault. I've spent most of the last decade on my computer. I was married once. A long time ago. She left me for someone with a bigger title. A title climber. Aye, pretty much. I thought we were happy. At least I was. When she left me, I came back here to put myself back together. Dun Dunbar's been my life ever since. Oh, what am I saying? I sound like a character from one of your books. - So you're reading my books? - Point is, people leave, we survive. I guess I just never thought I'd be alone at this stage of my life. You're not alone. You've got Hamish. Come on, then. - What? - You're clearly not writing anything. Oh, look at the hairy coos. Morning rush hour. Sheep. You might know them as expensive sweaters.

Watch your head. Mm. What are all these? Locals leave them. Legend dates back to the first Duchess of Dunbar. When war broke out, she donned the garments of a warrior, came to this very well, and laid a necklace on the edge for courage. What happened? Well, she went off to fight. Turned out she had the heart of a warrior. She ended up saving the village and falling in love with a man who fought by her side. A commoner. That's beautiful. Aye. If you like that sort of tale. Did they end up together? Wed on Christmas Eve at Dun Dunbar. Invited the whole village. And every Christmas Eve after that, for a century or two anyway. Christmas Eve at Dun Dunbar for the village. We should do that. We? Whoever owns it. Aye, we'll see. Okay... ...that's the end of the tour. How about we end it at the pub? You know, I dinna really hang out there all that much. Mm. We'll see. - Hi. - Hey. There he is. - Everybody's here. - Oh! - Mm. - No. - Oh, come on. - No, no, no, I don't wanna. - What's the matter with you, man? - No, I cannot sing. Course you can sing.

Come here. - What? - Tell me something. - Am I starting to look like them? - No comment. - No, that's worse. - No? No. Look, you've spent your whole life trying not to be them. So don't be. Meaning? You've been alone a long time in this castle. - I'm not alone. I've got you. - Aye. And here the two of us are, standing around looking at old paintings of people we hated. "The wind was speaking to her." Eh. Come on, wind. "The well was speaking to her." What the heck was the well saying? "The well whispered a story to her longing heart." Mm-mm. - Hello. - Tell me you've at least started. I have started. What is the plan here? I don't have an exact plan. - Just come home. - I can't. You can't just run off to Scotland and hide out in a castle. Why not? I'm not going to tell you that your life depends on writing this book. - Oh, gee, thanks. - But your career does. And I know you, Sophie. You have worked your whole life for this. What are you without it? I don't know. Very good, everyone. Follow me. I'll call you later. And this is where the third duchess would retire... Ay, oh. Sorry. Don't mind me. Oh my God, that's Sophie Brown! Everybody, if we could, um, just move on. I've read all your books. Could I have a selfie? - Oh. - Of course. Right. All right, then. No, let's continue on. That's very good. Uh... You know what, Thomas? I have an idea. Why don't I give the tour? Yes! Please! Well, why not indeed? Thank you. William Wallace, the very mason who built Edinburgh Castle, put these in himself, and they are filled with legends. So, in 1745, the sixth Duke of Dunbar barricaded the old castle walls and stood against the British army for three weeks. It was 1746. Fifth duke. Castle held for four weeks. And over there, it looks like a duke. Walks like a duke. It is a duke! It's been an absolute pleasure. Oh, I'm glad to hear it. Glad to hear it. Don't be strangers. Well, it looks like we're gonna have to reorder. Maybe stock some of your books. - Oh, I wouldn't go that far. - Hey, well done. Thank you, Thomas. Hello. Well, she's good for business. You know, it wouldna be the worst thing to let someone in again. Let her in? I'm trying to get rid of her, you divvy, or have you forgotten? What's all this? They're here to collect Sophie. Great. - Hello. - Maisie. You look different. Quite lovely. Thank you. It's all Sophie. Sophie? No, she did my hair. And mine. - She did everyone's hair? - Uh-huh. She's not doing mine. - Oh! I'm sorry I'm late. - Oh, no bother. Come on. Get in. It's nice and toasty. - Hi. - Come on. Hello, Angus. That's it. Let's get going. - How are you getting on? - All right. So... Whiskey, and leave the bottle. So you're a regular now? Very funny. Maybe he wants to learn how to knit. I tried to teach him when he was wee. No looking. Ooh. Uh, mind my wall, fella. We need to talk. About what? Outside. I'm trying to be accommodating here, but, um, this whole thing, it's not working for me. What thing? - You. - Oh. You're just... You're too much. You're everywhere. The redecorating, the gift shop, the tours. You stole my dog. The knitting! I mean, what's next? You're gonna run for mayor? Is there an election? This was not part of our deal. - Our deal? - Aye. The one where you drive me out, and I forfeit my overpriced deposit? I may not have gone to Oxford or Cambridge, but I know how to read a contract. No one in their right mind would have signed that, but I did. Because I am staying through escrow, I will be here on Christmas and New Year's. - In fact, I may never leave. - Mm. Maybe this is my next chapter. I don't know. I don't know anything. And it's scary. Guess I settled that, didn't I? Just keep knitting. Come on, Hamish. Good boy. What are you doing? - I don't like unfinished business. - Oh, of course. You're getting rid of my father's name. - Thank you. - It's not for you. He worked here. He's part of the history. - This your way of apologizing? - It is not. I accept. I am not apologizing. And I accept. "The well whispered a story to the wind about a woman." Bloody hell, that's terrible. Warrior woman, speak to me! It's a week before Christmas. I need to at least write the first page. Ugh! Come on, warrior woman. Come on. Speak to me. Please say something. Come in. Just gonna sit there, or you gonna help me move it in? I brought you a Scotch dresser. You got this for me? Aye. Found it in the attic. - Oh. - Just, uh, touched it up a bit. Well, it's beautiful. How's, uh, Emma Gale? - Emma Gale and I have parted ways. - Oh? There's actually another story that I would like to tell. Oh, aye? What kind of story? It's about a woman, a well, and a sword. So she's doing the killing? - She's saving a village. - From what? You're gonna have to read it. Send me a copy when you're back in New York. Give me a forwarding address. Thank you. I love it, Myles. I'm glad. Myles? There is something we need to talk about. A Christmas tree for the ballroom. So, what do you usually do at Christmas? This. Actually, this is the first Christmas I'll be without Lexi. Well, why don't you invite her, then? She's got a wedding. Oh, right. The eejit and what's-her-name. Okay, so "eejit" is "idiot." Aye. - "Diddy" is "idiot." What's "dobber"? - Aye. Spineless idiot. "Numpty"? Useless idiot. Okay. "Walloper"? Aye, that's more of a moron. Got it. What about this one? Aye. That's a fine one. What are you doing? Every time we cut down a tree, we plant two in its place. Oh. That's lovely. I always try to leave things better than I found them. - Aye. - Announcing the knitters of Dunbar. Oh! It's a little early for a party, isn't it? Well, there will not be any party without their help. Or my yule cakes. I'm baking for Dun Dunbar! It's stunning. - Oh, Your Grace. - Aye? I can't tell you how much it means to everyone in the village, celebrating at the castle. Well, I... I wish I could take the credit, but it's all her. Actually, it's us. Not that there is an us. No, no. Uh, excuse me. Here you go. Don't worry about him. He'll just get in the way. This one's nice, isn't it? I suppose it's about time these things saw the light of day again. I cannot believe this. Hey. You remember this? Your three-legged cow. Three legs is better than whatever this was. Hey, don't make fun of my sheep! - I worked hard on that. - I know. I remember! This one cut right in the back of his father's favorite chair. Then we had to go hide it in the stables! Remember?

We'll take that. - Yes, we will. - Very good. - Can I take your name, please? - Donatelli. Excellent. Maybe you're right about this party. Did you just say I was right? I said maybe. I should probably tell you, that bedroom you liked, where the fifth duke died, I made that up. Just wanted you to have the worst room. I know. The fifth duke died in the Battle of Culloden. The sixth was thrown from a horse, and the 11th, your father, died alone in a hotel room in London. Aye. Ugh! Not again. Excuse me. I suppose you know how I'm going to die too? I could come up with a few ideas. Electrocution. Not mercury poisoning? Or being fed to sharks? Well... I'm sure those could be arranged too. It's probably all those Christmas lights you made us put up. Oh, sure, blame Christmas. I would never do that. I'm blaming you. I think you might be needing these. Judging by your last foray into the electrical problems, it's going to be a long, dark night. Thank you, Thomas. I do feel good about this. I feel comfortable with it. I told you, your fans don't want something else. They want Emma Gale. Harper's is talking an additional four-book deal. Claire... You'll do the morning shows, tease the new Emma. Emma Gale isn't real. I am. Sophie Brown. Maybe not even Sophie Brown. Sophie McGuinty. Sophie McGuinty. - Who is that? - I'll let you know when I figure it out. Well, she better know how to write. What's with all the candlelight? Did you go back in time? He fixed it. Oh my God. You are never coming home, are you? You are falling for this guy. The... the earl! Duke. You know, I can work with this. You become a duchess, and we can rebrand you. No one is even gonna remember this fiasco. This... This is genius. Close the deal. Goodbye. Well, tomorrow's Christmas Eve. I'm aware. And Christmas the following day. That's generally how it works. Can't you just admit you have feelings for her, eh? And even if I do, what difference would it make? She's here to ruin me. - Ruin you? - Aye. This is the happiest I have seen you in years. - Oh, what do you know? - Everything. - Hello. - Oh, hello. I am sorry I am late. But I need a group opinion on this dress. I found it in bedroom nine. Too much? It's totally too much. You have to wear it. It's gorgeous. I don't even know if it fits. I can alter it. Okay. Um, all right. So now I have something for all of you. I... I don't think we should be wearing Dun Dunbar dresses to the party. Not Dun Dunbar. Saks Fifth Avenue. Thank you. - And for you, sir. - Thanks. Beautiful! Thank you! Rhona, that's gorgeous. - That's lovely. Oh, thank you. - Thank you. Matches your hair.

Give. Give it to me! What are you doing? I'm sorry. I found this. I thought... maybe I could wear it tomorrow night. Unless it belonged to your mother or your grandmother. You shouldn't be wearing that. You're mad at me over a dress? No. No. I'm mad at myself. Why? I'm mad at myself too. No, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait. We, uh, we shouldn't be doing this. No. No. We definitely should not be doing this. ♪ Wing your flight o'er all the earth ♪ ♪ Ye who sang creation's story ♪ ♪ Now proclaim Messiah's birth ♪ ♪ Glo-o-o-o-o-o-o-o ♪ ♪ Gloria ♪ ♪ In Excelsis Deo... ♪ Merry Christmas, Angus. ♪ Glo-o-o-o-o-o-o-o ♪ ♪ Gloria ♪ ♪ In Excelsis Deo ♪ - Good morning. - Yeah.

I'll just have a wee look. What's going on? - She's dead. - Deed? Buggered. That'll be that, aye? - What are you doing? - We're going back. To get another car? To the pub. For a wee dram. It's Christmas Eve. He cannot be the only driver in town. Edinburgh's two hours away, longer in the snow, and everyone's going to the party. Your party. - Everyone? - Wasn't that the idea? All right. I can borrow your car, and I will have it driven back. When was the last time you drove a stick on the left-hand side of the road? In a snowstorm? It's not snowing anymore. It is in Edinburgh. My husband just called me from the road. What about you, Angus? Will you drive me to the airport? Ah... Stay the night. Someone will get you out in the morning. All right.

It's beautiful. I know. - In we go. - Let's go in. "But Winston wasn't dead." "It was a coma brought on by his fall down the stairs." "To her shock, it wasn't Winston whose body lay there." "It was his twin brother, Myles." Oh! Sophie! Sophie, I'm sorry! Seriously? Sophie! You eejit. I'm an eejit. All right, come on, then. I just didn't expect this. Or you. I... I've done things a certain way for a long time, and to have someone come in and just... I guess it finally hit me that I'm losing the place. But I'd rather lose Dun Dunbar... than lose you. You want a castle? It's yours. You wanna go back to America? I won't stop you. But I can't promise I won't follow you. Because I've fallen hopelessly and pathetically in love with you. Pathetically? Maybe just hopelessly. I love you, too, you dobber. - Hm. - You're an eejit. I am, aren't I? - Hi! - Lovely to see you. Have a great night. - Tom. Cheers. - Where is he? I... I don't know. - Nice. - Ah! - After you. - Catch you in there. Easy on that champagne. You're gonna have to do it for him. No, I'm going to do something for myself. Maisie, would you do me the honor of a dance? About time. Ladies and gentlemen, may I announce the 12th Duke of Dunbar and the Lady Sophie... McGuinty! - She's here. - Oh, good. Good. Ladies and gentlemen, can I have your attention, please? Until recently, this place was as cold as the winds off the Firth of Forth. Colder than that! Thank you, Eamon. I thought this castle was who I was. Or maybe even all I was. And then... then, I met a lass who knocked me flat on my royal arse... ...and she taught me that we should be with the people we love on Christmas. And I realize that you, all of you here, are the people I love. You're my family. And so from this Christmas on, Dun Dunbar will throw a party to end all parties for the village. And now, I am honored to introduce the granddaughter of Callum McGuinty, who worked this land and had stones enough to carve his name in this very castle. Lexi! Oh! Ooh! What are you doing here? Myles got me a plane ticket. Oh. What about your father's wedding? Nah, I'll just go to the next one. - Oh! - Want a wee drinkie? Thank you. I'm learning. Well, you did go to Oxford. And Cambridge. Oh, yes, of course. And now, to the McGuintys. - To the McGuintys. - The McGuintys! Oh, Rhona, you've excelled yourself. - She made all of it. - Did she? - She should have a shop. - Yeah, of course. I'll pass them round. - Have you had one of these? - Oh my lord! - Rhona has gone mad. She is wonderful. - Now that is a work of art. Mm-mmm. Angus! Wow! Hamish! Go, Angus! Oh, oh! Well, merry Christmas to you, Hamish. All right, what do you think of this? The Heart of a Warrior. By Sophie McGuinty. You like that, huh?

Okay, perfect. Thank you. Are we shooting them on all three cameras? You've gotta love that! - Cut! - What? Congratulations, Sophie, on your huge, new best seller, Heart of a Warrior. Oh wow. Thank you. It is so nice to be back. Everybody feels that this is your best novel yet. Oh! Oh, it's my best book yet. Guess we do get a happy ending. - That's what people want. - Not that kind of a happy ending. Since you were last here, it seems like your life has become a total fairy tale. You bought a castle in Scotland, moved to Ireland... Scot-land. - It's a new province. - It's near Disneyland. - It's a little to the side. Yeah. - Exactly. Is it fair to say that you're going to become a duchess? Uh... Wait, do we get married, or do you just... What? - Wait, and also... - He didn't even propose! How are they navigating it? - I know. - Five days a week. Know what I mean? I do. I really do. Welcome back, Sophie... ...and a huge congratulations on your juggernaut best seller. I also don't wanna say the word "juggernaut." No, no, it was funny that she came out with that, with her head and her brain. "Juggernaut" is a very harsh, male, masculine, not sexy, pretty, feminine, soft word. It surprised me. ...best seller, Heart of a Warrior.
