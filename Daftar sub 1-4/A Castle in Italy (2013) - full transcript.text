A CASTLE IN ITALY WINTER Good Morning! I pay here? Yes. - How many nights? - One. How many meals? Two and a breakfast. - Postcards, honey, cheese? - No thanks. A rosary? Are you sure? Look how beautiful. - In oak color. - Okay, I take a rosary. Sorry to hurry. I need to take the train. It's 54 Euros. - You don't pray? - Yes, more or less. So, you see. It's like a stretch. It's not so difficult. It's difficult? We stay like this as long as necessary. But I'll miss my train! In this position you must be silent. One moment, we have to fix this. Else I don't understand if we're shooting or not. Stop the car. I have to talk to the actor. Let me down. It's your decision. It's personal. Private, secret. - It's your choice. - Right? Nothing unreal. Hold out a little to pathos. - But even aloof. - Got it, Dad. A decision which is. Existential and philosophical. "You kill yourself calmy" Yes, but faster. I'm freezing to death. Fantastic. Let's go. Come on! I'll put some more? Arrangementr with the rain! Go easy! Make a decision. Perfect. We have it. Very well, my son. It was good, right? Now we prepare the accident! You haven't seen a rosary on the way? I was coming from the monastery. And I got lost. I came from here. I had it in my hand. I wanted to take. And it disappeared. It's a mystery. If you find a rosary, know that it's mine. Excuse me Miss. You are. Maybe I'm wrong, but I know who you are. - Why are you here? - Don't know. Nothing. I'm walking. It starts to rain. And he came, so. Slowly. He lifted the hood. You say "thank you." And he said "nothing" but was unsympathetic. In theory, he was right. At least from a moral point of view. But nobody accepted it, although he was right. But we adored her. Excuse me. I need to catch the train at four and I can't miss it. You don't do movies? You want me to drive? We're shooting a film. No problem. - I can't let you go like that. - I need to go fast. Give me your phone number. - I have no phone. - So fixed. - An address. - I don't have one. - Your husband is jealous? Right? - I'm not afraid. I don't have the air, but I'm a brawler. I'll give you my number. It's much simpler. And where I live, because you never know. Mountain Street, Sainte Genevieve, Number 43. 5th district, Paris. I'll put it in your pocket. I await your call! Or come and see me if you want. As you prefer. You came on foot from Paris? What're you doing with that stick? It belongs to papa. Look at me! Hands off! Look at me! Look! Hands off! Look! Hi sister. Hello Brother. - The Mayor says-- - What people? - Enter where? - Some Sundays. There may be a lot of people. But who's the mayor? I'm the mayor. This place should be full of children. You see children here? - Why don't we have any? - I don't care. I personally would give you a donation and you could do a summer camp for poor children. .Or a center for drug addicts. We don't want to be here. You don't want, but I do. I love this place. - But you never come here, silly! - I love it all the same, silly! For now, we'll stay here and turn it into a Sunday museum. Don't confuse the mayor. Because we can no longer sustain it. We paid 10,000 Euros per month for maintenance. More wages, the gardener, the maid that is required. By the way, did you bring me the envelope? The money for the payment. No, I couldn't go to your home because it was raining. And now what do I do? I will not pay them this month because it was raining? Where I was? Yes, salaries. Taxes, insurance. Accidents. Last year, there was a huge flood. The Bruegel needed restoration. - You can imagine how much it cost? - I have no idea. In the gardener's cottage we could put a bar. And people could come to picnic on Sunday. - It would be something cheerful. - You may visit the castle. The castle, No. The gardens at most. The mayor said the gardens are not enough. People don't come just to eat the grass. - They want to come inside. - Visit the castle. People are curious, it's normal. Come to Castagneto, visit the castle of their patron, especially now that there are no more castles. This castle is still there. No more SOGAT factory and there's not even a patron. Nothing! I remember my mother, poor thing, now she's dead, right? She worked as a worker in the factory of her father-in-law. She always spoke to me about, your father. The SOGAT. The Rossi Levi family. Throughout childhood I have heard of it. Even today people are fascinated. I don't want to hear any more. Enough! What do you want? Come into my room and stare while I shower. While I shit, while I sleep. While I scratch my balls? - Like at the zoo? - That's not what I want. Stare at my death. Has anyone seen Jeanne? She's disappeared for an hour. Jeanne? We had an empire. My husband sold it for a pittance. Come see. Come see 'The Bruegel'. He painted all the proverbs, had a lot of imagination. He was also a clown. Look, there are two ladies pooping through the window. Will you marry me? - What? - Will you marry me? - No. - Right. I believe in one Lord Jesus Christ the only begotten Son of God. - What're you doing? - I'm putting it in place, cleaning it. Why are you crying? You know he gets angry. Do you think he will like to see you coming here to pray? But I said I'm just cleaning. This chapel is so beautiful. Transforming into a warehouse. We could consecrate it And use it as before. Look here! These are robes. We bring a priest on Sunday to say Mass. One might come to marry, to baptize. But. Who? Baptize whom? Happy Birthday to you! I take the advantage of darkness to announce, Ludovico and I are getting married. You're the woman of my life. The love of my life. I love you. But I don't think it's a good idea to marry. He never wanted to get married. Women fall in love with him. Since little, he has always been like that. As Jacqueline. She was a very loving woman. She was our babysitter when we arrived in France. And one day we realized she had fallen in love with my brother. She was much older. Some 40 years old and he was 12. A spinster in love with a boy. Now I throttle you as I did with my other wives. Because you looked in the cellar while I had forbidden. I've not looked in the cellar, I didn't see anything. Liar. You'll die for lying. - I didn't go to the cellar, I swear. - Perjury. And this blood-stained key comes from where? You have dropped the key in the blood. It's not true. Poor woman, I warned you. Now you will be executed. What a pleasure. Stronger. My little sister. - Giovane, sing! - Did you tell her about the chestnut? Giovane said that we should bring it down. It's sick. It has the disease of horse chestnut trees. - It's called "colorful cancer". - I tried to cure it. - I also did an intravenous. - With an injection? Yes, with injections. You should bring another one. An adult, but in good health and plant it. Look SOGAT! The SOGAT! Hello! Hello SOGAT! I saw something very interesting on television. They spoke of a shrine in Naples, where women go. They sit in a chair and. Become pregnant. You could see the chair. Indeed, it was not very pretty. But women. were very happy. Pass me the watering can. Why don't we go? Just to see! Without telling Ludovico. I too would like to go there. Yes, but you're a little old. And above all you're alone. You can't get pregnant by the Holy Spirit, it's sin. But she. Yes. And this mania of us pay in Swiss francs. why? I want the Euro as everyone. Every time you have to go up to Turin to change them. This month she forgot again. - She'll be back next month? - I don't know. A family of degenerates. Spoiled children, rotten. They are pampered, it's true. But that's normal. Already. The Prince and Princess of Castagneto. They make me laugh. Yes! Italy! Gerard! I don't have the key! I found it. What are you doing here? How do you know my address and that I'm returning today? Take it. Excuse me, a stranger in front of my house makes me afraid. I see. Anyway take it. Thanks, but it's not mine. This is true. I bought it near the Saint-Sulpice church. That makes a big difference? It's not the same to pray with. - I have to go home. - What do you do in life now? I ask because I want to quit acting. I'm tired. I don't enjoy it. It makes me sick. I feel stupid, submissive. You know what I mean. A puppet. I need money, but don't know what to do. I left high school last year, to work on a movie, so. I'm flattered that you want to confide in me, but. I come from a long trip. I'm tired. Excuse me. Okay, I'll be back tomorrow. You don't care. Instead, I would say yes. But who are you? Someone who has fantasies about an actress he saw in a movie 10 years ago. I'm not that person anymore. Clear? I'm 43 years old, going to be 44 and I'm a lady. I don't see what we could talk. I don't want someone there at the door of my house. - Gerard! - Okay, listen. I leave the rosary on the ground. Maybe someone sees it and picks it up. Good evening. - Good evening. - I can't. Only if you come in line. It wasn't my turn? You must wait in the line. It's cold, but it's the rule. Are you sure it wasn't my turn? It doesn't matter. You are not very honest. Excuse me? Repeat what you said! You are not very honest. Say it again! I'm not honest? And you are what? An old bitch! It's to get a clear conscience once a week! Let go! Bitch! Go get laid! All right? - Hello. - Hello. - How are you, Gerard? - All right Miss. Thank you. - Your wife is always in Lille? - Yes, always. - It's a beautiful city, isn't it? - Very beautiful. In fact we live near Lille, in Cond√©-sur-Escaut. - It's far from Lille? - Not very far. Lille is a beautiful city. Yes, very beautiful. - How's your son? - Actually, I have a daughter. Sorry. I meant your daughter. Is she doing well? Yes, Yes. She's just a baby. - A little more. - Yes of course. - Are you happy? - Very happy. We make a beautiful couple. We get along very well, The child is just beautiful. I'm sorry. You made me afraid. I remembered the address, because of "mountain". - And 43 because. - Yes. I wanted to leave a note to apologize for this morning. I don't know why but I was very nervous. There was no open-door code, so I entered. Forgive me. No problem. I enjoyed talking with you in the woods. I'm very happy. - So. - Okay. Maybe we meet again? Maybe. See you soon, maybe. Goodbye. Goodbye. Do you want to sleep with me? - No sex. - Yes of course. - Just sleep. - And what else should we do? You're too young for me. You're not too old for me. You should see me in the morning. I get drunk every night. - I seek love. - I want to have fun. I want children. - Not me. - It seems two of us don't agree. SPRING - Good Morning. - Good Morning. I'm the brother of. Good Morning. Excuse me. - I'll wake her. - There's no need. I was early for the appointment with an optician nearby. - I can try. - No need, really. Do you know where can I find a vase? A vase? I don't know if she have any vase. How strange, no vases. - Should I put them in water? - Maybe here. No vases here. - Don't know. - No. I don't see the vases. What's wrong with your eyes? I have AIDS. I too have an eye problem. Maybe not so serious. For me it's not serious. It's a disease like any other. I've astigmatism in the right eye. The cornea is a little. No one cares. What work do you do? I'm an actor. - Actor? - Yes. And you're in love? With my work? No, my sister. Yes, yes. I like her. But I don't live here. We met recently. Okay, but you love her? Yes, I really like her. In a hurry to die? Yes, all right! Serge! - Why are you here? - To save your life as usual. - Go to the bar? - I need to find my mother. I also have an appointment. At the American church. With Alcoholics Anonymous. Great! Yes, great. I called you a thousand times. I know. I'm screwed up. Maybe you could help me. You would have called. They take away the studio. I can't work anymore. If I can't work, I need to do something else. I know. I also. You too? I better go. I'm late. Good luck. You've put on some weight, right? No, I lost weight. - Four kilos. - But you look so good. You seem well tanned. It's the liver. Maybe, but look at your hair. They are less dry. - Always framing me. - Framing what? - Controlling me. - What should I do? Gouge my eyes? I just said that your appearance is good, and I'm happy. It's no crime. But I'm not well. Don't be nasty. It makes me ill. I have nausea. I have fever. And diarrhea. Your father as well, had a bad temper. But beware. I threatened him several times to pack. .Then at that point he became gentle. Be careful! Careful of what? One of these days I may have to pack. - What floor? - Sixth. I brought you some flowers this morning. Yes. thanks. Excuse me. You like them? - I met her new boyfriend. - Yes? He's very young. A bit confused. Confused? Why now? So suddenly? It's not all suddenly. For years, I'm warning you. - About What? - A negative tax audit. Why don't we do anything? I had proposed some solutions. It's not true. I proposed several times to repatriate your money. Lighten up, say something! She seems impaled. You look as if you don't understand what he says. Yes, I understand, - I'm looking for a solution - You remembered what he had said? Yes, no, yes. - You look stupid, do you remember? - No, no. I remember. - I was hoping it would be solved. - You remember? Have you ever heard of "sobering-up rooms"? No, not that. I don't know what it means, but of other things, yes. Last year I warned you, anyone could make a complaint, at any time, because your lifestyle was incompatible with your income. Yes-yes-yes. Okay, fine. We get it. And now, what do you propose? In addition to separate us from our memories, our childhood, and the family home? It's not even our money. The money comes from a factory-- We never set foot. Really, it was our father. It's not our fault if. Stop blaming Mr. Avesseucius. Avanecius. Sorry, Avesseucius. He's trying to help us. He was always very, very kind to us. Almost a friend. The poor man does what he can. Therefore, I propose to make a small auction. Maybe in London, Sotheby's. - And sell Bruegel. - No, a small sale! Do you understand? And slowly, Castagneto opens to the public. - No. - No. Still no. Not Castagneto! It's Father's castle. How can you sell his memory. - We can't sell his memory. - Then we don't sell. I'll end up in prison and you'll bring oranges to me. This is not a laughing matter. You're both fools. Can we continue? They are both miserable. Continue, please. - What is it? - If you don't want, I won't come. Okay, I'll spend my birthday alone. You're not alone. Loneliness is something else. You have a family. Okay, I'm going home. I'll take a taxi. That was not very nice. What? It was not my idea to take you to meet my mother. Is that clear? I don't feel you should meet my family and vice versa. I don't like this mix. It gives me chills. What a pain in the ass! Come on! - I didn't want to be with you. It was you. - Come here. - I was better off alone. - No, you were sad. - You were lifeless. - Lifeless, but well. I was that way for years. I was used to it. I did not need anyone. Even now! That is all, I'll take the subway. And go away, please. I see no future for us. Nothing! No time, no future, no. children. - Do you want children? - Don't know. But I know. It's my dream. If I don't have kids I'll die! Finally! What a beauty. No kiss, just handshake. Nathan prefers it that way. Come. Come in. His father came. He insisted. He was very curious. Andre! They arrived. - It's a great pleasure. - Me too, ma'am. Don't call me ma'am! We're almost the same age. What? But it's true! - And we were born on the same day! - The same day? That's really funny. I was born at 3 am. I wasn't, but the important thing is the day. - Happy Birthday! - Happy Birthday! Andre, my ex-husband. - Louise. - Hello! - You like dry ham? - I love it, thank you. - Excuse me. - What? Sorry, you must be accustomed to other things. - To what? - I don't know. She has castles and even cooks, it seems. I have a castle. Only one, in Italy. Yes, well. you've been there? - In Italy? - To the Castle. - Cheers! - This should be good right? It's very good, my son. Have you ever eaten it before. It's the only thing I can make. "It's the only thing I can make." She always says that. In your honor. Why are you laughing? What fools! She always says: "Only this." I said I can do this alone. Look here. He was chubby. At birth, he weighed 5.5 kilos. - This is too much? - Of course! A hairy ox! And now he is almost beardless. He had a huge penis. In the beginning. I thought it was a malformation. Now I have no idea how. I suffered a lot during labor. A lot. At that time, there was no epidural. After his head was out. I had. an orgasm. Stop this! Enough! Do you want a slap? - Why did you said that? Shit! - Shit what? Shit what? Don't look at me like that! You know I didn't do that film. Yes, I know. You never wanted to know what happened? You never wanted to know what happened? No. I never wanted to. What happened wasn't my fault. And what happened? It happened that the actress was not surrendering to the role. She refused to give me her essence, her soul. But it was for an Italian distributor, and you left. It wasn't? The money was. On the Italian part. I don't know. It was misery. She closed in herself. Not even a little. It wasn't my fault at all. This isn't about blame. It's love. Why didn't you tell him we've met? I don't know. I forgot. - Were you afraid, ashamed? - Of what? - I don't know what you're talking about. - You know that. Nothing happened between us. You know that. It's me, Serge. I hope I've not woken you, Marisa. I need money. I have to. Really! In two days I'll be on the street. We'll talk tomorrow, Serge. It's 3 o'clock in the morning! Call me tomorrow. Yeah I know, 3 am. Bailiffs are on my tail. - Have you been drinking? - Yes, I drank. And will continue. I liked so much, when you played. "Nights In Spanish Gardens" Manuel what's his name. I was moved to tears. But my favorite part was. "Wahlberg Variations". I used to watch you for hours. Looking at your hands. I thought how beautiful they were, as they were getting old. And then I stopped coming here. Because? Because you said in front of everyone, laughing, that my son was sick. Yes, but it was the truth. Let me go back to sleep. I end up on the street. I have nothing left. I'll die on the street. Where are you going, Marisa? Will you drop me like a dog? Who cares if Serge. You end up like a dog in the street! Are you kidding me? I don't need you. I go to the street. I'm going to die, I don't need. I don't need a tip. That little Canaletto there, If I sell it I could buy half of the 11th district. And you want to fix me with 300 Euros? You don't understand? I need someone to. I'm drowning. I need someone to drag me to the shore! Fuck your 300 Euros! - Stingy old woman! - I used to like you. You were a friend of my children. I don't know. I thought you had talent. But now. My son is not well. I have other things to take care of. Besides that. Who are you? We should. I'd like to. I don't know. I want to be with you throughout life. Us! This lost look is excellent. You are too beautiful. As I said, the genitals are different. There is a full sex. .And one empty. - Wait-- - But without this thing pelvis. I see you too tied. Without the thing. It's very simple. You sit down and cross your legs. Cross your legs. - Maybe-- - Please Sit down, Nathan. I really like the hair. Cross your legs. Straighten up. You are proud of yourself? You are proud of yourself? You're beautiful. - She's beautiful, no? - I won't make it. Sorry, I can't. I can't. - Of course yes. - No, seriously. - Yes, you can. - No, I can't. What is it? I think he went crazy. - Sorry, I can't. - Yes, you can. I'm going out of my mind. This wig, the difficult dress to wear. None of that matters to us. They are things of fashion. I'm sorry, excuse me everyone, I can't. It won't work and I'll make you lose time. Find someone else for Monday, sorry! You're forcing me, damn it! - Why? No. - Yes, you're forcing me. Let's go back, please. You're forcing me. - I'm being forced too. - Who forces you? The life. And my mother, poor woman. It's to please your mother? I swear, this will not do anyone any good. But otherwise we do nothing! It's not true. Something we do, but not this. We don't act. Why force things? I don't want children. I don't want to be a father. I'll be glad if you tell me that you no longer want any. I just want to sleep with you. I have this right? Let's go home and have sex, please. Gerard, turn back. We go home. What should I do, Miss? No, please, not again. Let's continue. Let's continue. Do you feel it's right having children when you don't want them? Don't know. That never happened to me. See it's not right. Isn't that clear? The chance is only 3%. 3% is huge. It's huge, damn it! I want to go home. Turn around. Wash the penis with this antiseptic. - Yes. - The hands and penis. Then, fill this container. Right. I have to put. I have to fill it all? - You did 3 days abstinence? - Yes. Here are some magazines on the table. And the TV. - Press this button-- - Yeah, sure. Thank you. It has just this scene. But it restarts automatically. If necessary. You must be quick, because. There are other patients. Don't take too long. Thank you. Sorry, I'm not Mrs. Sabatier. - Really? - I'm Miss Rossi Levi. Look here. It says "Mrs. Sabatier". Sorry, I'm without my glasses, I can't read. But it's time. How long are you here? Where's Mrs. Sabatier? You here for long? I don't know but. Now they will be operating, they will be taking the eggs. - For fertilization. - Exactly. - With the sperm? - Everything will be fine. Which sperm they will use to fertilize my eggs? I'll give you half a Valium, before the anesthetic Valium will calm you. I just want a bracelet that says "Rossi Levi" and not "Sabatier". I want to put. The sperm of my husband, my partner, on my eggs. No, I mean, my husband's eggs, in my partner's spearm. And my sperm. Listen here! We have no sperm here, all right? We are not distributors of sperm. We don't do that here, okay? Your husband is in the collection room. I'm saying, where is the sperm of Mr. Sabatier? - And my sperm? - To each his own sperm, to each her own husband's. Understood? The sperm of your husband will go to. But I'm not married! Your partner, then. It's the same thing. It's not possible! Imagine if they were all like you, Mrs. Sabatier. This is not difficult. It's just a sperm transfer. Your husband's for your eggs. Serge. I got your message, but. You were busy, I imagine. How are you? Good. Apart from the stick, well. - You know Jeanne? - Hello! Let's go? It'll be a bit brutal, can you give me a check? Your mother gave little. It begins to falter, no? I'll not give. I don't want to. - I'm sorry - Well, let's go. Even when mom fed you I didn't agree with her. I saw no reason. We're not the Red Cross. Come on, You're right. Better not to lend a hand. Aide Nothing. It's dangerous. To be honest, you don't look so good. - You look like a corpse. - Are you crazy? You should be in a hospital. I'm saying this as a friend. You should go to a hospital, my friend. I wonder what will happen with your money, when-- - Leave. - I hope you'll leave something. Go away, please. - Are you married? - Enough! Get out of here! Get out! You can't say such things! Ludovico, say something! Get out! Go! Shall I call someone to put a bullet in your head? You understood, profiteer? Don't come here anymore! I'm sorry. I think I'm going to faint. Wait, I'll help you. Please hold on! Ludovico, please. Ludovico! Help! Somebody help me, please! Help! Someone! Help! Advance a little. Try to fit right on the edge. Great. Now open wide.

I'll go and deposit the two embryos. That's it. It's all okay. I forgot to tell you. I ordered the tree to Castagneto. It comes from Austria. But only in three months. The new one arrives on a truck. And the old one falls. - It'll be a spectacle. - I'm pregnant. Maybe twins. - Shouldn't we be happy? - But I'm happy. We're close to the hospital. I gave the test. They made me mad. - What test? - The play. I gave up. Why? I was not interested, I left. I thought you liked theater. Like what? Makeup? Repeating a text? No thanks. It depends on the text. Why did you stop? Why did you stop? It's not a real job. Even less for a man. Forgive me, okay? I'm happy to be here. You only think of yourself. All the time just you and your problems. You don't even look at me. What happened? It's my brother's wedding. I don't want you to come. Don't come, please. Don't come. Shit!

Article 371 1: Parental authority involves rights and responsibilities and be aimed in the interest of children. And it is exercised by the father and mother until they come of age or emancipation of the child in order to protect "Safety, health and morals." What a doll. What a doll. What a doll.

Even in a Russian church in the rue Daru in Paris. Once I went to a synagogue. This is a mortal sin. What do you want here? I came to. well. - I did a fertilization "in-vitro". - What? A fertilization "in-vitro". And I thought that for the better, I could sit in the chair. I live in Paris and I could go to Lourdes, which is closer, but my mother told me about your chair. So, in short. It's dropping. It's falling. Sister Giulia, come help me. I was telling her that I did a fertilization "in-vitro". You understand what it is? They removed the ovaries? - No, only a few eggs. - Some eggs. Then the husband. Gives the sperm. And that makes embryos. I have two embryos. It can be twins of excellent quality. Tell me, are you married? This is a mortal sin. We designed. She's not married. - If someone's not married she must go. - No, excuse me. For this baby here, we've not made love, we did it outside. - The doctors did it. - We didn't mate. - In the hospital, right? - Yes. I'm not understanding anything. You're talking to me in Chinese. Let the other ladies go. Let's go, walk. Get out. My goodness! Santa Maria Francisca! My goodness! In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Do you believe in Jesus Christ, the Son of God? You go to Mass every Sunday? Santa Maria Francisca, get her! Let me, please. - I can't! - You leave. Let me, I pray. Let me stay a little bit in this chair. Please! Don't take me! No, don't take me! No. I'm sorry. You're right. About us, you're right. Hospitals are not for me. Masturbating in the hospital. That's not how I am. You forced me, you shouldn't have. I wouldn't have. But it went well. Your life is not my life. You treat me like a pet. Stay with your brother. What about my brother? I don't know. Okay? It's over. I don't want anymore. I want to finish it. - I'm going. - All right, I understand. What do you think? I'll die because of you?! Hello, Madam! Grape juice or orange juice? Louise! You're bleeding. You've got blood there. You've got blood there, too. SUMMER Luisa! Where were you? I lost you, you left me alone. I went to buy cigarettes. I was worried, you could have told me. - Could you not help me! - Sorry, okay? - What time is it? - What? - What time is it? - Don't know. We must go. I'm tired. Why did you never get psychoanalyzed? You never accepted. I did Psychoanalysis. I went to a very nice lady, the angel. I went only twice and she healed me. I don't want to. But if you talk to someone intelligent, surely you'll feel better. I feel good, my only regret is being here. - I feel great. - Great? No man, no children, no job to do. I had a job, I stopped because I wanted to. Take more care of yourself, meet people, earn a salary, which is no shame. You acted well. You were not a Anna Magnani, but. - I wanted some space. - Space for what? For life. It seemed to me that. I had to make room to live. You're too complicated. I'm a simple person. I'm not very smart, just use common sense and sincerely I don't understand you. It's not my fault. You don't understand. Look at these English. Get a little sun and think they're in the West Indies. There Omar Sharif! I swear it's him. I seem to see it. Along with Lara. In the snow. Come on. Riding in the desert. He made a face! Dad? Yes? Why don't you answer the phone? - But it hasn't rung. - Of course it has. My phone must be defective. Why didn't you answer? It's working fine. Reply! - You made your dinner? - Yes, eggs. Would you like some? No thanks. - Are you all right? - Yes. Your mother said you have a new girlfriend, is it true? - What is it? - My heart's racing. Strange. Go find someone. Marie said you've a new girlfriend. It's true? Weird! That's what she said. - It's not true. - Well I like that. It amuses me. - A little gossip. - No new girl. This thing will continue to buzz over my head. - Did you take Lithium? - I quit for years. You need to take your Lithium. Stop it. I take Valium, not Lithium. You're crazy. I want to graduate. That's nice. But why? Because I want to study. - For what? - I want to finish school. You are not cut out for the studies, everyone knows. - It'll make me happy. - You are the happy kind? And I'm sad. No need for a diploma to be an actor. Believe me. Don't take it badly. - Dad? - Yes? Look here. - Whose scarf is this? - It's a scarf. That's not what I asked. Whose is it? I don't know. Whose scarf is this? - It should be mine. - No! Whose is it? I told you it's mine. Stop playing, whose scarf is this? - Bullshit! - Whose is it? Answer me! Answer me! Answer me! - Calm down. - Are you sick? Answer me! Answer! Whose is it? - You're making a fuss about nothing. - You have to take your Lithium. It's absurd. "I don't know!" Still you're pretending to not know what happened? - I forgot to tell you. - So you know who she is? - It was a movie. - Which movie? - It's been a long time. - Which movie? - It's been a while. - You're lying, lying! I swear you're lying, I see it. You met her secretly. The movie wasn't finished and this was left here. - Pervert. - This prevents you from living. You're a liar. Your movies make me sick. Your films are shit! You're sick, crazy! I bet you don't get it up anymore! You piece of shit. I get it up. I still do. Did you like it? - I like what? - How many times? - How many times what? - With him? In the hotel? Answer. I found this in his kitchen. How did it appear in his house? Don't leave. You had sex there? We just had coffee. He confessed. You arranged a meeting? We met on the street, coincidentally. - Don't lie. - I was feeling alone. We met by chance. I was feeling bad. I felt alone. We drank and talked for about 5 minutes. You feel alone? Are you feeling alone now? Why didn't you call me? A 3 some would've be nice. You think this is funny? Why didn't you tell me you had sex with my father? Why didn't you call me? So you didn't feel alone. Need help, miss? Gerard, all right? - All good and you? - I'm fine. - I love you! - What? I love you. I miss you. I hate life without you. Nathan! My brother is very ill. - What are you doing here? - Nothing. In my pajamas on the street. - Who called you? - No one. And then? Don't you realize I have a life? Always on my tail. Why not stay in place? And then, let's get married? Let's go to a hotel, so you can get pregnant. I'm really excited. You're drunk. That never stopped me from having sex with you. All these years you never said that my sperm smelled of beer. - You're vulgar! - Not Vulgar. Obscene. You are very smart. Listen. I have an idea. What is it? You fill in the amount. I don't need money, no more excuses. I loved you with passion. Your family was my family. Your mother was my mother, Your brother was my brother. You're the woman of my life. I didn't love anyone else. And then. Just because I told the truth during a dinner. You just dropped me. I was treated like crap. Ignored, just because I spoke the truth. Before, you were insolent, but were strong, it was wonderful. You were young. And now, you've got huge anger. It's a kind of poison. You lost all your kindness. I can't stand you anymore. I can't see you! What are you doing? He doesn't want the fan. - I'll be back. - He said no. I insist. - No one listens! - It's roasting in there! You are doing what you did with Bruegel. He knew, he discovered it. It made him sick. You mocked him. You mocked him. Why do this behind his back? What about Castagneto? What do you think? You think that he won't find out? You're waiting for him to die before he finds out. Louise! Excuse me! - I just need a fan. - We're closed, come back tomorrow. I see people at the checkout. It's a fan for the hospital. Already closed, ma'am. You can only open a second, please? - Come back tomorrow. - But I need it now. - Sir, please. - I told you it's closed. But it's just a fan. I need it for the hospital. - Already closed. - My brother is sick. I want a fan! I want now! He got better? He's still in this room? It's not worse is it? He'll make it overnight, right? If he stays the night, I should, too. Will he make it or not? Even a "maybe" would make me happy. So, he'll stay the night, right? He's not dead yet, is he? What do I do with the fan? I don't know what to do. It's hot. I brought the watermelon. It's very good. It's cool and easy to swallow. It's hot. Are you sure he's dead? What are you looking for? My mirror. We'll see. Look here! - The mirror fogged! - How do you know? It's blurry. He's alive. Come see. - Come and see the mirror! - When you speak, it will fog. It's normal. Look around for our taxi! Come on, it's our taxi! Mom, come on! In the Name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. May the peace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. And with your spirit. You may be seated. Ludovico proudly carried his cross. With courage. His mother here, crying. Reminds me of another mother at the foot of the cross. His sister, Louise. Childless. Virgin, in a sense. So, Ludovico. Thanks. Thank God, thank you for this sickness. Thank you, because it allowed him to reach a place where he is finally happy, purified and at peace. One moment, I'm sorry. Let's stop the bullshit. "We thank the suffering!" Really good. Don't you think? Suffering is hell, it sucks. For this reason we must be together. We must love each other. I loved him. 20 years ago, the first time I saw him, I loved him. You can keep his suffering. Shove it in your ass. He could've at least married this poor woman. Now, what remains for her? Nothing. They seem to have married. I feel like I saw in the paper this morning "Rossi Levi". No, he was very stingy. It's a family of petty. The rich are all crazy and mean. Yes, but they also cry. There was a Mexican drama which was called... "The rich also cry." What a stupid title! The grandfather was an anti-semitic Jew. He converted and married a Catholicism. He says to avoid being deported. I say it was to get richer. It seems that he adored Hitler. He had been photographed with him. I won't pray anymore because the sky is empty. I just want you to know. Just today. It might have been yesterday or tomorrow. I completely forgot it. I must apologize. I completely forgot. He had called from the hospital, and told me the date. Excuse me, is it true that the castle was sold? - What is it? - I'm the mayor, remember me? - It's better to put it there. - Right. It is true that the castle... No longer belongs to the "Rossi Levi" family? - Yes. Even the tree! - Who bought it? - Who are the new owners? - The Russians, apparently. - Russians? - Russians or Chinese, whatever. - What are you doing here? - They fired me. But I can appeal to the union. She can't, she is quiet. No, for me it's worse. I was sold along with the castle. As if I were a brick of the castle. Rope! Go behind the bars. Please. Who let them in? What are you doing here? It's dangerous. Stay behind the tape. You, too! Out! Close the gate. The tree is about to fall. Miss Louise! Mr. Nathan is here. Mr. Nathan. I can't hear. I can't hear anything. The tree is about to fall! to Virginio
