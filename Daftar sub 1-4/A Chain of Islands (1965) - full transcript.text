Ungan F. Bruno Gunter Brown Harold Conway Kazuo KITAMURA (Narrator) Yoshi KATO Asao SANO Taketoshi NAITO Tanie KITABAYASHI Written and Directed by Kei KUMAI Japan provides 255 military facilities for America. One of those is Saitama Prefecture's Camp Scott. Just transferred from Hokkaido... Lieutenant J. Pollack has been assigned there. He will be taking over... in Camp Scott... as commander of Military Police, CID Headquarters. Hey Tak√©. The CID... is responsible for crimes committed by US military personnel. For example... murder... violent robbery... hit and run traffic accidents... drug possession and trafficking, all investigated by... plain clothes detectives. Akiyama is the CID's head translator. Mr. Akiyama, Lieutenant Pollack wants to see you. Come in. Oh, Mr. Akiyama... please be seated. Listen, I want Akiyama to do me a personal job. It's nothing official... nothing. I guess so. As you may know... the dead body of Sgt. Limit of Kanagawa CID Headquarters... was found last summer at the wharf on Tokyo port. Yes, I know. Kanagawa Headquarters announcement... was very dubious... referring to the actual cause of Sgt. Limit's death. Sgt. Limit used to be my subordinate at one time. I have to know the truth. Could you go ahead and investigate this case? I guess so. Since you have nothing special now, start working from tomorrow. I'll help you. Alright. Okay, thank you. So, Mr. Akiyama... Please go to American forces police station and get the files. I'll check with Kanagawa headquarters. At the beginning the Japanese working on the base... felt strongly... they were foreigners on a foreign base. However... the longer they crossed the white line and passed the guard-post... their Japanese identity imperceptibly began to fade. But somehow... Akiyama alone... refused to allow himself to change that way. When Lieutenant Pollack... personally requested him to take up the Limit case, his identity struggle... had matured over many years. The year was 1959. Akiyama-san... Oh... it's you Harishima. - Long time no see. What's up? Is it a case? - No just an errand. Pandering to the Americans as usual. I should've visited sooner. - Me too. I was expecting you. Nakada, the file.. - Yes. Ohh... meeting Inspector Kurosaki! It's no big deal. But... Kurosaki has a foul look. Who's foul. - What? Take a bath sometime. INVESTIGATION DEPT. HQ SECTION III However, Mr. Akiyama... this case is a strange one. Here it is. Take a look. 1958 August (Showa 33) Around 12:40 that afternoon... the body of a middle aged foreigner... was found floating in Tokyo Bay. From the identity number... the body was identified... as an American stationed at CID HQ... Karaphane E. Limit, an army sargent... stationed at the Kanagawa Base. TOKYO HARBOUR POLICE A joint investigation started immediately. TOKYO HARBOUR POLICE Without doing an autopsy we can't release the body. They said, that they cannot return the dead body to you... until an autopsy has been completed. You may rely on the identification. Yes, of course. But, in this case, please turn over the body to us, will you? I understand that very well... but only for this case, please release the body to us. Yes. Okay? You okay with that? Come on. Move the body to the truck. Come on, let's go. Make it fast. Hurry up. Wait please! What will you do with the body? The body's for us. Japanese police have jurisdiction over the body in this case. Don't carry it away without our permission. Please wait! Please wait! Wait! Wait! About the last movements of Master Sargent Limit... about three weeks ago at approximately 1 pm... he had lunch with a Japanese person he met at Haneda Airport... That is to say, a woman. KOBAYASHI Atsuko, age 29. Atsuko, which spelling? - (gives Japanese kanji spelling.) Then soon after they started eating, Limit suddenly got up... "Announcing the arrival of Flight No. 604 from San Francisco and Honolulu." "Japan Air Lines announces the arrival of flight no. 604... from San Francisco and Honolulu. He left in a hurry. And then? - That's all we have for now. He left his ID card with the woman... He must have known that someone was after him. Could be... I can't write an article from that. It must be murder. - The weapon? So... all for today. After that... the investigators worked hardr ound the clock... but despite their effort found no clues. And Headquarters were becoming resigned to the impasse. As things stand... we need to investigate Limit's close associates in more detail. But chief... Boss... a big problem. - What? I went to see the dead body... but they say it's already been sent to America. More US bullshit. The victim died in Japan. Therefore the jurisdiction falls to us. This isn't occupation. Japan's an independent country with international agreements. They've ignored that. And then... suddenly after 15 days... CID HQ... issued their report. CID HQ, KANAGAWA BASE There was no water in Sgt. Limit's lungs... CID HQ, KANAGAWA BASE therefore it could not be death by drowning. No poison was detected either. The cause of his death may never be known. "May never be known," what the hell's that mean? Anyway they gave us a report. Hey, hey...they've released a completely one-sided report. Are we supposed to swallow that? Isn't it strange. Is it believable... that they investigated everything? Yes... it's absurd to say the cause of death may never be known. How can you call yourself dept. head? Don't make me angry... And so... the facts released were too few for an article. Everything vanished like bursting bubbles. POLICE HQ FORENSIC LAB So... the way it ended... it's clear they didn't want the case background... to come to light. For an ordinary soldier it would've been different. About Akiyama... - What? Oh hi. Am I late? Hello. - Hello. - How was it? About that, you see... I went to Kanagawa CID HQ... to the records office... Thank you. Death caused by accident... Is that all? - That's right. There should be more data. What happened? I may be asking the same question, if I were in your position. This is indeed a completely imperfect file. I can hardly believe it. Who destroyed it? Who? What do you mean? What happened anyway? Tell me the truth! Right. Till now we've assumed... it was probably the CIA covering things up. But... even the CIA... claim they're hitting a wall. The CIA too is getting push-back over this case. Where's the pressure coming from? Higher up in the US army? What if... higher than the US army? What then... the embassy? No. bigger than that... very likely. Akiyama... the next morning... began digging into Sgt. Limit's earlier life in Yokohama. The police have questioned me so many times. I was just his maid. I know nothing about Mr. Limit's private life. Then... the woman Sgt. Limit was living with, KOBAYASHI Atsuko... The wife? - Yah. What's she doing now? - It's such a shame. After Mr. Limit's death everything went downhill for her. Even I go to see her from time to time. Hey... that's damn cold! - Cut it out! You're the ones should cut it out. There's a sick person here. You guys always making such a bang-bang racket. Does a Ms. KOBAYASHI Atsuko stay here? - Yes. You came to visit her? Well, come in. You've got a visitor. Come in. How are you? I cooked something. You hungry? - No thanks. Sir... It's you. What..! Are you the doctor? - No, no. From when Mrs. Kobayashi... was a student. Well please sit. I'll bring some tea. It's been a long time, eh? Yes. Why have you come to see me? These days... this is where I'm working. I heard that you came to Yokohama and married a foreigner. Well... never thought I'd meet you like this. Here... have one. You're not going back to Hokkaido? I won't go back. Dad's shop went bankrupt. Even the land was taken. It would be hard to go back now. I see. Eat up. - Right. Then... they don't know you're here. It's so delicious. Isn't it. Do you remember? Ice cream? - What? Just after the war... ice cream came on the black market. You girls used to skip class to buy it. When we got back you read us the riot act. "You girls are abusing your freedom." You were so strict then, Sir. But when we gave you one, you sure enjoyed it. But... that was made with saccharine. From an American base, no doubt. Since then... it's been... fourteen years, no? You... should go to the government hospital. It'd be the same in hospital. I told you to stay in bed. In the afternoon when her fever starts she always gets like this. You okay? Professor... what brings you to visit me. Actually... I've been asked to investigate Sgt. Limit's case. Limit...? Uncle... Welcome home. Oh, were you waiting? Uncle... you always come home so late. Lonely by yourself? - Ya. What else. Of course he is. It's such a shame... to leave Natsuo-chan alone, even if you are busy. Want to go to kindergarten? - Yes. There's a good kindergarten near my house. That'd be good. Hello. Mr. Akiyama here? - Yes. Oh it's you. Good evening. - Yes. Come in. Seems you're busy as always. - Ya. Yesterday... what happened at HQ? Like I told you... just a flunky's errand. Mr. Akiyama... Was it the Limit Case? So you 'bad boys' made me. I should've known. Have a drink. Just as you say. I snagged some good clues in that case. - Really? When HQ killed it, I figured they'd go to waste. But now you've re-started it. I see... so tell me. For a price, though. Right, I'll keep that in mind. Here goes... firstly... in the contents of Sgt. Limit's pockets I noticed a subway ticket. Ticket? I heard from a foreigner... they use subway tickets like vouchers to receive black money. Including counterfeit dollars. - Counterfeit? - Yes. And tons more stuff. - All sorts. So a simple subway ticket could be a voucher for any number of things. It's unusual... which makes me think... there must be a well organized, major organization... behind all this. So then Limit... this organization... And actually... counterfeit dollars are flowing into America. The FBI looked into it but didn't find anything. In America too... That's why we should get some... and you should investigate them here. Shall we go. - Ya. See you again. Thanks. - Thanks. Hi. Please look after him. Sure. Come this way. So... can you tell me your name and your age. TSUKAMOTO Natsuo, six years old. You're a live wire, eh. Akiyama-san... he isn't your son, is he? No... my sister's eldest. His father was an engineer at a mine in Kyushu. But last year he died in an explosion. It also emptied the local village. My sister has more kids... so for a while... I... will be taking care of him. Ah, I see. So I hope you can take him in the day. - I understand. Stay with us and play here until evening. I will take him home when I leave. - Good. Thank you. Natsuo, that's good, eh? - Yes. What is that? Mother Mary. I appreciate it. - Sure. Mr. Akiyama... Back, back. Like a ride. - Okay. What? Go. Where to? - Your old student's place. Actually... I went to Yokohama yesterday and dropped in there. She's getting weaker. It's harsh but... it may be our last chance. Is it okay with your boss. Sure. "Find you and go."... his words. Hey... Oh professor... - What's the matter? Her condition's serious. - Doctor? I'm just getting him now. Hurry! - The bag. Here. - Right. Head over there. Miss Kobayashi... Miss Kobayashi... I'm here. Professor... Water please. Stay with us. Professor... that day... I'm sorry. Actually... I wanted to go back. Professor... I didn't go back either. You were unfortunate too. I'm sorry... such a thing happened to your wife. I too... if Limit hadn't died. more and more... Mrs. Kobayashi... Was your meeting with Sgt. Limit at Haneda Airport your last. Yes. Where was Limit going. I know nothing about his job. How was he when you met him? Did he say anything? Miss Kobayashi... try to tell us. They told me to say nothing. Who? It was over the phone. I'm not sure. At that time... Limit said... "Karasawa's targeted me." Karasawa...? Yes. What else? It had to be... Zambel. Zambel? Miss Kobayashi... Miss...? North sixth street, Sapporo City... (copying address) Karasawa and Zambel. What's 'Zambel' mean? I wonder... Mr. Akiyama... I wanted to ask you one day. What's on your mind? I heard your wife's case was filed as 'unsolved'. Who told you that? My boss... he'd worked at Sapporo HQ then. It wasn't 'unsolved'. I almost had it... but they covered it up. What do you mean, "almost had it"? It was an American soldier. There were many such incidents at the time. What was that? If you don't mind. After the war... when I got back from the south... I was teaching English in the Sapporo Women's College. It was about that time I got married. Her name was Satoe. The autumn after we married... one afternoon... she left with her shopping basket... Satoe never came back. And then about a month later... in the bush behind the US Army camp, they found her body. The night was cold enough to snow. Jeep tracks and soldier's foot prints were found all over... where Satoe died. Rose thorns... had scratched her all over. I heard from the Inspector later... there were roses in the Base garden. Satoe was grabbed and held there... and pushed into the roses. Poor thing... she must've struggled desperately. After that... I quit the Women's College... and started as an interpretor at the CID. To find the perpetrator? - Of course. I searched a lot. But... the soldiers I suspected, they transferred all of them to Korea. Every one of them died there. At that time... for that matter even now... the Japanese Police and newspapers were totally impotent before them. So they called it "unsolved". Not a single line in the newspapers. I was... so damned angry. A human being's murder... can't just be ignored. This girl too... still so young... Mr. Akiyama... let's solve this case ourselves? I'll try to help you between shifts. Someone must have done it. Let's do it, Mr. Akiyama. Excuse me. This is a counterfeit US dollar now being passed in America. This is a real US dollar. Oh no... this one's the counterfeit. On the surface it's accurate to 1 micron. It's very well done. Last May, the same counterfeit dollars started to show up in Japan. Sgt. Limit was focusing on these. Could ordinary individuals make such accurate fakes? - Absolutely no way. Sit down. Please have some. - Thanks. I've studied the history of counterfeiting. In most countries spies or criminal gangs are involved. In Japan too? - Yes. In Kanagawa District, an army lab at Inaga Noborito was doing this work. LABORATORY 58 Counterfeit notes: Indian Rupee, American Dollar, Soviet Rubles... Chinese Hoei, also... passports, and other documents. Usually... all countries try to foil counterfeiters... by every possible means, including special printing techniques. This laboratory used a very expensive German press to print them. So... this printing press... where is it now? When the war finished... it was taken from the Noborito Lab... to a printing company somewhere in Tokyo. It may have been destroyed. A printer in Tokyo? - Ya. Where are the operators of that press now? Actually that's the thing... it's strange. The head operator was Colonel Yamamura of accounting. Listed as "missing" after the war. Working under him was a Major Ishuin, also listed "missing". Their families? Major Ishuin's daughter... I think is... Could I ask you... about when your father... went missing. At the time... I wasn't living at home, so I don't know much. But your mother must have been alive. Surely she told you something. Any small detail is fine. Please tell me if you can. Why are you asking about him now? I have a feeling... that your father's alive somewhere even now. My father... the year after the war... went fishing alone on the ocean... got lost and died. But only your mother testified to that. - No, it's the truth. I don't believe it. I seems to me you know more. Teacher... The teachers' meeting is starting. - Right. Sorry for your trouble, but I know nothing more. I see. T PRINTERS T PRINTERS Printing press, eh? - Ya. Right after the war it was brought here from the Noborito Lab. I got back from the war much later than that. So I can't really... Oh... Mr. Iguzawa might know. He quit and... And... where'd he go? Couldn't say. Mr. Iguzawa... Then... let's go. So, thank you. - Thank you. So... that would've been autumn, 1946. Suddenly MPs showed up. MP's? (Military Police) They brought a crane. They moved like ninja. They had that heavy press out of here in seconds flat. I figured as much. But... last year, that American who came... what was his name...? He asked the same questions as you. What's this about? - Who was it? It was around June... - Was it Sgt. Limit? What? - Sgt. Limit. Aah... that Mr. Limit... asked about a Zambel too. Zambel...? That's the company name of that German press. Zambel. The Zambel and Sgt. Limit... - Who's that? There we go. Good bye teacher. - Good bye. Let's go. - Right. However often you meet me, it's the same, isn't it? You're... aware of the Limit case, aren't you? Limit was the sargent who was murdered. Limit...? from CID headquarters? He came to meet you? When? Last year... in July. Was he murdered? Your father told you about that Zambel press? Yes. So then... The Zambel could still be around somewhere. If it exists... your father must be with it. If it was only the machine... without a trained technician... it would be useless. Father... is still alive! Now get him! Come on... come on, hurry up! Let's go! Dad... Get him outta here now. Hurry up. Come on. Dad, Dad. Come on... come one. Let's go. Dad... - Hurry! Let me go. It's clear. - Dad... Dad...! Why didn't your mother ever call the police? "About these things... "you should never speak to anyone." That's what someone... told my late mother. That person came just after my father was kidnapped. That person... who was it? Who was it? It was Mr. Karasawa. Karasawa? Mr. Akiyama, do you know him? First name? - Eizaburou. KARASAWA Eizaburou...? So that's it... The Zambel printer and Karasawa. Now it makes sense. KARASAWA Eizaburou... ex-military police. Calloway's Unit... you've heard of it? During US occupation, they handled all spy ops. Karasawa was well known among his teams. There were lots of stories about him. So Karasawa is still working.... I wondered what happened to him after that. After what? Yes... the Shimoyama incident. July 6th, 1949, about 19 minutes after midnight, a goods train... running down the Joban Line from Tokyo between Kitasenju and Hiyase stations... passed under a bridge. There it hit and killed Shimoyama, the Japanese Rail boss. Police HQ... sent detectives to investigate it as a suicide. Other detectives working for the Tokyo Prosecutor... were sent to investigate it as a murder. We couldn't see his face clearly... but by body type it looked a lot like Karasawa. Why was he there? - I wonder. But the following day... someone had cleaned the blood stains on the tracks. Clearly they wanted... to destroy any evidence. Blood stains on the track? - Yes. At the time we were looking... at a splinter group in the rail union. But after I saw the guy who looked like Karasawa... I started to doubt that theory. So that's... Karasawa. What should we do? You finally got to the bottom of it. - No, we're only just getting started. So the man who murdered Sgt. Limit was likely one of Karasawa's men, no? Ya. However... this Karasawa... who's behind him is the real question. Hey, Mr. Akiyama... you cracked it. This is the list of the people living in that apartment. One stands out... the head of a foreign gang. Here, K. Roberto. Karasawa must have gone to meet him. K. Roberto. Hang on a sec... The villain behind the Shinkokai incident. Ya, that's the one. The Shinkokai Incident... and that is? I wasn't involved in the investigation, so I'm not certain... but the guy in charge was... from the Tokyo Prosecutor's office... He was...? It was Prosecutor Hidaka. Knock before barging in! Shall we go Akiyama? He's no longer a prosecutor, he's a lawyer now. TOKYO CENTRAL BAR ASSOCIATION The Shinkokai Incident was around 1954, wasn't it? Excuse me. It began as a simple embezzlement case targeting the White Feather Charity. While investigating... we found the head of the White Feather Sect... had obtained a huge amount... of black money from a broker while he was in the US. It completely surprised us. The guys you're looking for, Karasawa, K. Roberto... and Kirk Hudson... were the three main culprits in the Shinkokai Case. Kirk Hudson is...? Pierre church's chief accountant. "You'll get what's coming to you," Hudson shouted. Not what you'd expect to hear a priest shout at the police. From this arrest, they discovered black dollars, black passes... black goods, people smugglers... Slowly the framework of an international criminal gang began to be exposed. The case? It was very early in December... A new foreigner showed up in Police HQ. and immediately took away all the related documents. Everything's okay. Don't worry. Not your cases. - No. Just a moment! Don't worry. Not your cases!! And so... that ended our investigation. Just like that. Who was the foreigner? Definitely a Spy Agency type. They didn't want the case to widen. Karasawa and K. Roberto... and also Kirk Hudson... I wanted to find out what it was the Intelligence guys were trying to hide. These are my notes about some of them... have a look. See this one, Sasaki. TOKYO PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE TOKYO PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE At one time he worked under Karasawa. During the American occupation... what was the strangest work you three were asked to do? Flooding the market with counterfeit rubles. Counterfeit rubles? Where were they made? The printing press... was it a Zambel? The operator? Only counterfeit rubles? Also Chinese Hohei. - How much? A few truck loads. Sometimes they were found. In the Katai Maru Incident for example. In court they presented it as a North Korean smuggling operation. And then? It never ended. Right. Drugs also. It began in Dadabushi. They made a lot of money in opium... moving it in the lining of old clothes. But those ruined by the drugs were Japanese. I quit because I was sick of all the sordid dealings. So it was okay to pass counterfeit money in the Shinkokai case? I wasn't involved. - Cut the crap! That dishonest stuff... I'd already washed my hands of it! So why were you working for the Intelligence Agency. Why?! Friends from the Nakano School recruited me. The reason I got into it was... to help the Akia tribe get independence. But the Intelligence Agency never intended to help them. So they dealt in drugs too. - Yes. This... Sgt. Limit guy... when did he come here? Around the middle of July last year. Then where'd he go? - I introduced him to Sasaki. He's moved on now. But before he left the Intelligence Agency he worked a lot with Karasawa. SASAKI MOTORS. It's ancient history. I don't want to discuss it. I'm working hard now just to manage. I just want to ask what you and Sgt. Limit spoke about. Mr. Sasaki. Please. Wait a bit... but not here. I see. Right. Thanks. The profits from the counterfeiting and drugs... where did that go? Back then, mostly to fund Spy Agency operations. How much was it? There were more sources. Altogether about 150 billion yen. And now? What they do now I've no idea. That's all I know. We poor people can't even imagine such an amount. Alright. Thanks then. - Thanks. Ah... Police Commissioner. Ah, it's him. That one. So that's K. Roberto K. Roberto...? Similar. To whom? I'm not wrong. That man changed his name. He did very good work exposing a lot of black market goods. But the things he exposed were mostly... exchanged for cash which went to fund Connolly's unit. So we can assume that after the occupation he changed his name, stayed in Japan and took over the funds from Connolly's Unit. Connolly's Unit. After the Shimoyama Incident... in August 1949, the Matsukawa Incident took place. Some people said both incidents... were part of a plot by groups like Connolly's unit. However... these claims still can't be verified. But... the Eastern Branch of the Spy Agency's influence... was greater than that of the US Occupation Police... even more powerful than the police commissioner. What happened? Just now he's speaking to K. Roberto. That's the chief accountant of Pierre's church... Kirk Hudson. What are they talking about? This is the only way they can meet openly. If even a word got out, it'd turn Japan upside down. Eh..? That woman... she's the head of the Tokyo Branch of Universal Airlines. The airline? Damn! If only we could go in. Always the same... everyone is somehow connected. Good bye. - Good bye. Hi. I'm sorry it's been so long. - Right. Natsuo-chan? Is he well? - Yes. Miss Shiina... You passed the flight attendant exam. That's great, isn't it. Yes. I never thought for a minute I'd passed the English. Really, it was a miracle. Surely God must have helped me. You haven't started work yet? - No. Well... do your best. - I will. Please excuse me. The bad crow... is telling me what to do. Drink your water. Finish it up, every drop. I'm home. - Welcome back. Big sister gave me this. I suddenly thought to drop by. When we talked, what you said stuck with me. Is that so? Have you eaten? - Not yet. Ah... deep fried tonight. I'm sorry, I made it without asking. No, it's a big help. Everyday Auntie cooks the same thing. We're getting bored. Ah... how can you? What a thing to say. Earlier big sister took me to the market. - Oh... that's great, eh? So... Natsuo dear, help me serve the food. That's how... for seven years after the war spying was very well funded. That money flowed... to Iran, Iraq, Laos, Viet Nam... all over south and east Asia. What was it used for? For disrupting economies, weapons and strategic materials. All over there were incidents: endless civil wars and coups. - Yes. Who knows if it will happen here. Recently... lots of drugs... began flowing into Japan again... and... new counterfeit dollars. We've managed to track K. Roberto's movements.... but still... we have no decisive proof. His group are associated... with the Eastern branch of the Spy Agency. This Limit incident... it's likely due to their pressure that it was hushed up. But... this is all unbelievably scary. The conflicting efforts of various spy agencies get mixed up. It's confusing. The reality is that it's now become part of Japanese politics. That's why... it is so scary. Superficially nothing's obvious. Sgt. Limit uncovered a fact... of that... we can be certain. Cuddle up. Better not stick your nose into other affairs... too big. If the truth about the spy ring... is grasped by certain individuals and given to foreign governments or people, the US will be hotly criticized and receive a heavy blow. Adding this the Cuban failure and the deadlock in Vietnam... you will understand why Sgt. Limit had to disappear. They had to do it. I'm 'nisei' and I also carry American citizenship. (nisei = 2nd generation in US) For the sake of American democracy... I can't stand about it. Neither do I. But... I shall leave for Okinawa... soon. Okinawa...!? - Yes. Best regards to your wife. Hi... sorry I'm late. Thanks for last time. - And for coming when you're busy. Please sit. What's the matter? Nothing. Only there was an odd fellow outside. Oh well... it's probably nothing. Here. - Thanks. I have to be careful, my wife's always getting worried about nothing. When she saw you two, she thought you were recruiting me as a spy. I see... when I phoned it felt uncomfortable. - I'm sorry. I don't know how much I can help you. So, what's this about? - Ahh... Just before Sgt. Limit was murdered... where were you two? In Hong Kong. Hong Kong? You didn't know? - No. So... why was Limit in Hong Kong? He was investigating K. Roberto's drug transport route. Actually... the Spy Agency... ignored Burmese land title and had a big opium plantation in Kengtung district. From there the opium flowed via Hong Kong to the world. There base was in Burma? Yes. But not only Burma, in Laos and Viet Nam as well. Even with strict laws in Japan... if they can't control the foreign sources, they can't eliminate drugs here. The quantity of the drug they transport is extraordinary. What they ship is low grade morphine. They transport it in steel drums. They convert it to powder in Japan? - It's a simple process. The army special group Eastern Sector... can process 10-20 kgs. heroin overnight. So then... when did you hear that. Well.. that's... And counterfeit dollars... what about that? Mr. Limit... on his way back from Hong Kong, stopped over in Okinawa... to investigate the activities of the Ryu Kyu Industrial Bank. Earlier this bank had stopped offering loans. That was pretty strange for a bank. Maybe the spy agency had withdrawn a very large amount of cash. And repaid it in counterfeit dollars? - Well... So then... the Zambel press is now in Okinawa? Zambel press... how do you know about that? Do you know Major Ishuin? Did someone tell you not to say? The spy agency... demands that those going clean... swear a strict oath before leaving. There's a limit to what can be said. In those days... we had no ideals. We worked some vile black ops. So we looked down on each other and hated ourselves. So all of us in the group... were greatly relieved when the War ended and we were disbanded. Now we're clean, all that's behind us, and we try to live normally. We all knew self-hate, and suffered together as men. I can't betray them. Karasawa went clean too? - Yes. He said he was publishing a financial magazine, but he wasn't making much. I saw him last summer. He said he was just driving by. What is it? Karasawa came to you because he was searching for Limit. What? Did you tell him Limit was going to Okinawa? Yes. Fool! Limit said... "Karasawa's going to kill me," before he ran in Haneda (Airport). Karasawa was? That means... because I told Karasawa Limit's whereabouts... he was murdered! Karasawa broke up your group... only to form a more powerful one. He's still involved big time! So... in the end Sasaki... unwittingly... became a double spy. Sometimes it happens. I'm sure he must know about my father. Shouldn't I meet him? No chance he'll say any more. It'd be better to look for him in Okinawa. There are many possibilities. In Okinwa, we can ask Captain Spencer to investigate for us. The enclosed photos are of Major Ishuin. We think at this time he's still hiding in Okinawa. Hello... Akiyama speaking. Oh... Mr. Kuhara. Before you say anything... we found Sasaki's dead body. What?... when? Where? ... Kawasaki? - Yes. Kanagawa police autopsy report showed alcohol in his body. He un-buttoned to relieve himself... but fell off the embankment and died. He was murdered. Tell them the details of his history. Yes... I've already told them several times. Ya. - I see. Wait... Come over hear. Over this way. My husband went to Hachiouji in the morning... so why was he found in the Kawasaki Sea? The police said his death was an accident, but... he was murdered. They said there's no proof but that's nonsense. After you two came... my husband suddenly began acting differently. During the day he was agitated and at night he had nightmares. He often got up. He seemed deeply troubled. He cried... I saw him. Please... what happened to him? When you came, what did you tell him? We'll tell you later. Why can't you tell me now? What are you hiding? He was... always an honest man. He didn't do anything to be ashamed of. His business... was finally... going well. We thought a new life was starting and we were so happy. We'll see you. Wait...!! Are you trying to escape? If you'd never come, he'd still be alive. It's the same as if you had killed my husband. Give him back to me! - Let's go. Give him back to me! Mr. Akiyama... - KARASAWA Eizaburo - (Person who gave wreath and donation) What? Closed? - Yes. The Lieutenant, now. Mr. Akiyama... I want you to stop the investigation. Why is that? When we know so much about this case. If you insist on us to stop, we'll do so as you please. But, we wanna know a reason. We want to know the truth. I don't know anything about it. Yes, you do. You should know! - No I don't! Mr. Pollack... - Get away Jap! I'm sorry, Akiyama-san. I didn't mean it. I knew... he would tell me to stop some day. Thank you for everything. But, Mr. Akiyama... are you going to quit here? See you. Around 7:40 am... in a Tokyo River... the body of Universal Airlines stewardess... Shiina KAYOKO, was discovered. As the cause of death was suspicious, the next day an autopsy was convened. It confirmed murder. The investigation was set up in the local police station. Okay then... So what was the cause of death? Bruising on the neck and bleeding from the eyes, indicate strangulation. From the eyes, eh? So she was killed then? - Yes. Chief... was a man involved? Crime of passion... - You fool... the victim was a devout Christian. That's all for now. Wait! Come on. That doesn't tell us anything? How can I write a story from that? So the victim was a devout Christian... that doesn't really prove anything. There must be a man. She worked internationally. He may not be Japanese. A foreigner? - I'm leaving. But she's a devout Christian... The victim... could've met a foreigner through Pierre's church, couldn't she? Do the foot work. Don't guess. - Right. He just might be right. - STEWARDESS MURDER - - POLICE SEEK LOUIS SAMUEL TESTIMONY - - WILL ONLY SEE POLICE IN HIS CHURCH - So... this incident is somehow connected to drugs? Yes. The murdered stewardess may have been a drug 'mule'. The surest way to move drugs... is to use someone who won't be suspected. A stewardess drug 'mule'. - Seems so. She worked on Hong Kong flights. Hong Kong... it's the hub used for north Burma drugs. So you think she refused an order from the spy agency? That's would seem to be the case. She came to know too much. They couldn't let her live. Miss Shina... last time we met she said... "It's a miracle I passed the exam." "I had no hope I'd passed English." Maybe Hudson's gang... slipped something under the table so she couldn't fail. They planned to use Miss Shina's kindness all along... then they destroyed her. They stole her life. Hello... Oh... you're all here. I figured as much. Why'd you come... and late? - How about you? The criminal is Samuel, isn't he? - Samuel? Oh, is that so? - No, no. Not really. You can't even cover it up. - What do you mean? So you should ask. Today a detective and translator brought a tape recorder to headquarters. Know whose voice was on it? It was the killer's voice although intercepted on a phone call. But we have to do such things... otherwise we'd never get an arrest. So how's that then, okay? My guess is... that tape... Yes. Yes. I know. But... But... What am I going to do now? You had a visit from a detective today, didn't you? You must wash everything by yourself. It would be dangerous if the blood type is detected. Do you understand? Under no circumstances send anything to a laundry. When did you come to Japan? In 1956. That's what the immigration file says too. However... - Just wait. The immigration office, right. Please. In fact it was 1951, wasn't it? No. Don't lie. You entered illegally. Illegally? Who arranged your illegal entry? Please wait. It was K. Roberto. I don't know that person. - We have proof! Mind your tone of voice. Mr. Samuel is not a suspect. He's only here as a witness. All the same, Sir... The questioning proved hard going. Samuel didn't touch his tea. Neither did he smoke. However... even more surprising was... he didn't use the toilet the entire day. Clearly, he was afraid... that samples of urine or saliva would give them his blood type. They new the killer's blood type was 'O'... having done an ML test on the sperm found in the victim's body. The questions were repeated and changed... but no matter how they tried in the end it produced nothing. After that... Samuel suddenly complained of internal problems due to fatigue... and had to be admitted to Shinjuku Hospital. All outside contact was cut off. Sorry to make you wait. No problem. - Please come. Everyone here? No, no. - Please sit. Let's start now. - Inspector... what should we do next? I suppose the questioning is finished. What, why finished?! Can't we bring him in? I don't think so. So it's been closed? Well, it's not certain. What the hell? That's my impression. There's a rumour you're under pressure from outside over this incident. No, nothing, - Really? What do you mean? - You know what he means. Next... about the alibi.. when asked, all the church members gave the same answers, word for word. The replies they gave us made it clear... that the church had given them identical reply sheets to learn. On the surface at least, we have to acknowledge testimony... from third parties as reliable. They have very cleverly manipulated the law against us. But... if nothing changes I cannot break their alibi for now. We have to question them repeatedly until we get true answers. Good. - Let's do it. Leaving? - Yes. Next... Hello... headquarters. Yes... the airport...? What? What's that? Samuel...?! Hey... Yes, yes. - What is it? Yes, yes... What? Wait a second. Chief... Haneda Airport Customs report Samuel just passed through. Went through? Tell me the details. What should you do? Captain... what... Yes... I'm First Division captain. He's on the Immigration Department's list of illegal foreigners. Make sure... Yes, yes I am. No doubt it's Samuel? - It's Samuel. Yes, and so? So at your end... can't you stop him leaving? What!!!??? He's boarding the plane now? Please delay that airplane's departure. Make absolutely sure! What... it's already waiting for clearance. He's escaped! The bastard escaped! Captain... He escaped? - Wait. Wait. You don't have the guts to tell the public. If you can't tell the public... what you've done, you should resign. I have human rights too! Don't use that excuse. - Hey. How can you tell when human rights apply or don't? A Japanese woman's been killed. At your briefing you used the same human rights excuse. Who made you the judge? Why do you respect only bad people's human rights? Explain to me human rights! Ask the Chief! Hey.. he's coming. Chief! - Wait. - Chief! Wait! - Wait. Chief... wait! Chief... - Wait up. Give us something. You're sure of his guilt, aren't you? Tell us the truth. What's the commissioner's real reason? This case is a hot potato the commissioner wants gone. Holding Samuel in Japan means trouble. That's why they let him go, isn't it? That's his real reason. Say something. - What's the truth? Is it okay he just walked out? - Tell us something. Please. - Tell us. - Tell us. Come on. Tell us, chief! - Tell us! So, sit down. - Yes, Sir. The Ministry of Justice says that if he has a valid passport, we have no power to stop him... unless you already had an arrest warrant. Samuel was only called as a witness. He was only called as a witness, but Commissioner, we are... - Ya, sit down. Did the Christian officials submit... an official letter sending him home? - No. For no stated reason, defying public opinion... he returned without permission while under investigation. It's completely wrong. Well... what can we do, eh? I want to continue the investigation. Stopping's unacceptable. - But a main party is no longer here. I think the time has come to end it up. Thanks for all your hard work. Massive protests against ANPO (Mutual Cooperation and Security Treaty between the US and Japan) Agreed 1951, revised 1960. Limited Japan's independence and power. Granted US military bases and kept US military personnel outside Japanese legal jurisdiction. Here, your tea. - Thank you. Yes? Hi. Thanks for this morning. I'm sorry I had to phone. - No problem. Come in. What's so urgent? - Ah, actually... Captain Spencer in Okinawa... this morning we received this from him. So... please read it. Thereafter... I went back over Sargent Limit's movements. In the town of Koza... I met a very interesting man... managing a tourist shop on his own. He said he was CHIN Yosei of Chinese background. He revealed that Sargent Limit had visited him several times. Judging from the photos of Major Ishuin... his face, age and body type were remarkably similar. He laughed and denied it. I felt he was indeed the Major. What should we do? Like some? Perhaps I'll have a little. Well... to your good health and success. You see... I'm leaving very soon for Okinawa. For very long? - Well... planning on two weeks. So... what's in Okinawa? We've discovered someone who might just... be your father. Father...? Thanks for waiting. Here. I'm going to Okinawa to verify he's your father. Could this be true? Probably. So... Huh... what? Could I go too? This time I'll be traveling as a single tourist. If he's really your father... you'll have lots of time to meet him later. Right. Please be careful. - Yes. I'll be fine. Shall we eat? Next stop. See you. Please hurry. Alright. American President Kennedy at 7 pm, 8 am Japan time, on the 23rd...(1962) will make a special radio and television broadcast to the American public. Signs of an attack on the US have been detected at the Soviet Army base in Cuba. Harajima-san... phone. - Right. ... for safety. The ship carrying weapons to Cuba will be forced to return. America... Yes, Harajima here. Ah, it's been a while. Yes. What? You sure? Please just tell me the truth. What happened, Mr. Hatori? Right. You sure? Yes. I understand. What's going on? Teacher... A reporter is here to see you. I'm in the middle of a class. But... he wants to see you... right now. So... will you look after the children? Okay. What is it? Captain Spencer in Okinawa... called the base about Mr. Akiyama. Mr. Hatori found it hard to say. He sent... me to... talk to you. Did something happen to Mr. Akiyama? Last night... in Okinawa... at the coastal reclamation site... Mr. Akiyama and... CHIN Yoshi's bodies were discovered. They'd both been murdered. Mr. Akiyama... "Based on Captain Spencer's information, Akiyama went to a coffee shop in Koza city. to meet the Chinese man, CHIN Yoshi. They were seen leaving the coffee shop with several strongly built men. The police, suspecting they'd been kidnapped, began a search. When... where... who had killed them... the final police report stated "unknown". And also... "The truth about the incident may never come to be known." This mysterious last comment from the Police authorities... led to rampant speculation. Actually, when I met you after Mr. Akiyama's funeral... I wanted to ask how you were. Unfortunately... I've been buried in work. I'm fine as you can see. - I'm relieved to hear it. However... the way things ended still upsets me. For some time I couldn't concentrate on anything. In cases like that... there's nothing you can do. While investigating, I often felt the task was hopeless. We found several good leads... none panned out. We detectives... complained strongly... to no avail. Is that how it is? If you give up trying... no matter how long we wait, our lives will never change. From now on... it's up to us to carry on Akiyama's work. I spend everyday now teaching children. Trying to work out with the children... what we need to do to find true happiness. I've... spent my entire life teaching. If I hadn't... the work Mr. Akiyama was doing... would seem futile to me. The Chinese man who died with Mr. Akiyama... could he have been your father? Almost certainly he was. But... he suffered terrible guilt from what happened in the war. Postwar the spy agency coerced his cooperation. So... if Mr. Akiyama asked him to come back... he would never have agreed. He wanted to live alone. A long time has passed... since the war. But... the days before with father... still feel like yesterday. Hi. Hi. - Okay? I'm late. You're looking good. I got transferred. I can't fight with you anymore. Where to? Okinawa branch. Okinawa...? - Ya. Was it your choice to go there? Yes. Gonna do it? - Ya. When do you leave? Today at three. See you. Drop me a line sometime. You too. - Right. Smoke? - Sure. So you're saying goodbye to Japanese nightlife for a while, eh? Stupid fellow. Okinawa's part... of the Japanese archipelago too. THE END Translation by Keiko Mima and Yuko W. Subtitles by salmond
