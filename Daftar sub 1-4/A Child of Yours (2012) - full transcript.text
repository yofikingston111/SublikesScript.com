One, two, three. A CHILD WITH YOU Read it out loud. "I promise I won't scare you anymore. "I promise I won't be a pain with you anymore. "Of course, I'll be awful to other guys, but not to you." Sign. - Remember me? - It's coming back slowly. I don't think we missed one another. We even hurt each other a lot. Why did you call me? I couldn't before. Now that I'm in your past, it's possible? You can avoid possible. It's not good for our daughter when her parents avoid each other. That's a bad answer. Still, it's a reason. Don't worry, you have another woman protecting you. I would need a wall of women to be protected from you. I'm not alone anymore either. Thanks to them, we can talk again? And see each other, now that we're well protected. I won't ask if you're happy with her. No, don't ask. - You won't ask me if I...? - No, I won't. He's a good fuck. I wasn't a good fuck? Enough. Can we have fries for two and two glasses of champagne? It's funny, we split up exactly three years ago. You're a pessimistic woman. You only read obituaries in the papers. I know we met on a 26th of July. You only care about beginnings. You signed. Thank you. Did you tell your dentist we would meet? I did. Your 'I did' is smug and downright stupid. How did you feel as you came? Slightly nervous? Last night, I dreamt I was fucking a girl. Not really, actually. Many things kept me from doing it. Don't worry, it wasn't you. I'm glad to know that... ...the idea of seeing me makes you hard for other girls. You signed. That's why we broke up. You signed. You signed. Yesterday, I took a cab and the driver talked about sex right away. When I told him monogamy was cruel, he stopped and asked me to get out. He got out too. He showed me the condom box he had in the trunk. He said: "It's because of my eyes. "When women see me, they understand right away I love them." It's true he had beautiful eyes. I was hoping you'd give me a fake smile. You still think I can smile about the cruelty of monogamy? What about you? With your beautiful eyes, where do you hide your rubbers? Back then, you didn't tell me about the girls you wanted to sleep with. I'm not your buddy. I'll never be your buddy. You're not my girlfriend anymore, are you? Before you came, I started quivering. I couldn't control it. Then it stopped. For our first one to one, it'd be nice to call it a day. We could end this on an absolutely positive note. I was perfect, right? Perfect. I have to go. I'm going to be late. FIRST PART "DO YOU THINK I'M GOING TO START LIVING THIS HELL WITH YOU AGAIN?" Will dad go to the school fair? What, again? I'm the one who goes to the school fairs. Dad doesn't like the wonderful dances and songs they teach to kids. It's not his thing. What about the cello classes? He never comes with me. He's waiting for you to become a great cello player. I promise he'll come to listen to you play then. My father doesn't like children. Poor thing. Did she annoy you much with her mean father? - Are you okay? - Yes. I'm younger, it feels good. Doesn't it show? - All of a sudden? - Yes. I've tidied things up. I've decided to keep only the hours when I laugh with Lina. The hours when I listen to the music I like. The hours when you caress me in the bed. The hours when I play Ping-Pong. The hours when I wander at random in the street. I've gotten rid of all that doesn't matter. The hours without the slightest grandeur. In other words, the hours in the back shop. The hours with a too busy schedule because I'm afraid to sweetly waste time. All those hours when the heart is tired of beating for nothing. If I'm not wrong, you're 17 or 18 at most. Barely. You think I'm sexier when I'm younger? What a tricky question. Aren't you ashamed? You've never been sexier. You've been at the top of your game since I met you. Good answer. What about the hours with me? They count double. Bitch. Sexy? - Sexy? - Yes. It's when a female in heat gets close to a male and tries to seduce him. I know what 'sexy' means. Cheetahs are not sexy. It depends on which cheetah. I don't want to talk to Augustin anymore. He's too sad. Raphael's the same. He's with Lola now. I don't know if I'm in love with Raphael or Augustin. My mother's the same and I don't want that. If this keeps going on, I won't talk to boys ever again. We saw you in a fancy tea house with a chick. You were trying to be charming. It wasn't me. I don't know how to do that. Really? Do you want to know what I've been told about you? - Do I have a choice? - No. As soon as I think about something stupid, I want to tell you to make you laugh. It's what I've missed the most since we split up. You don't laugh enough in your life? That's what you want to hear? Could we be silent for a second, to avoid saying things we might regret? I met the girl. But it wasn't in a tea house. Your informer sucks. It's funny, because nothing really worked out. Try to describe me in a flattering way. Push yourself, you'll see. You'll see. Cowardly. And honest. She only felt the cowardice. Go on. Envied and wanted. She couldn't see how much one could want me. Selfish. And exceptionally charming. I don't care about that girl. If she had swooned over me, I wouldn't have budged. One day, I threatened to leave you. I threatened you and you said nothing. You should have told me I was wrong. But you remained silent. How can I take you seriously? Then you spent one hour fiercely repainting the toilet's ceiling. I spent one hour looking at you. I understood it was over. Then you left and you never came back. Your youthful smile makes me miss the meaning of your words. I could only hear the music. Can you repeat? Loser. - You don't care about that girl. - You're the one who doesn't care. I couldn't stand being at war all the time. Passion is war. But not all the time. You're a timid guy who wears sweaters all year long. I thought about it. After we moved out the first time, it was over. You loved me the first six months. Is that a stupid thing to make me laugh? You're a guy who tells himself stories beforehand. When they happen, you stop being amused. That's beside the point. It's my fault. I answered just to be smug. You put me too high. Or too low. Never where I belonged. When you start making sense, tell me. I'll think about it. What do you mean 'too high', 'too low'? I overestimated you because you could read me very well. I liked when you studied me like a book. I was flattered. There must have been amazing thing nobody ever saw before you did. I was panicked too. There are so many things I don't like about me. You were out of things to read? Victor cannot read? Victor is a nice guy. He's funny, caring. He's really curious about others. Curious about me. Unlike you. Don't you want to talk with me for real? Why did you call me? Did you have a reason? What do you want to tell me you cannot say? Are you getting married? Are you pregnant? I'm not getting married. I'm not pregnant. You see, I can't read you. He wants a baby. Before, I didn't. Now, I'm not so sure. If you're here, it means you know. I'll be pregnant soon. I wanted you to be the first to know. You're not pregnant. I'd rather tell you I'm pregnant when I'm not. When you're pregnant, we won't meet again. I've decided to have a baby. He decided. Before, I didn't want to. If you want, we can have lunch together on Friday. There is one condition. Don't be pregnant already. How will you know I'm not? You'll be less pretty. You were damn pretty when you were pregnant with my child. You can never be as pretty with him. I haven't been perfect like the other time. You're not a perfect girl. You're not perfect at all. - Are you okay? - Yes. So? He looks okay. What did he say? He talked about girls. It deals with monogamy as the perfect example of cruelty. What about his student? We don't talk about her. - Me neither, I guess. - No. He doesn't want to talk about you. It's nice he confides in you about his sex life. "I'll play with all the other girls "but I'll never fall in love with them. "I'll only love you." Don't you like it? - Are you looking for trouble? - No. I don't want him to talk about me. I don't want us to have phony talks about him. See him whenever you want. I can see his student whenever I want. And you can fuck her whenever you want. You're funny when you have no sense of humor. Make love to me first. - Really? - Yes, me first. I know why you saw him. Tell me. You wanted to know if he'd be okay about the future child. Good analysis. In the end, did he allow us to have a child? If you were a really clever psychiatrist, you wouldn't be a dentist. Ask him to be the child's godfather. It could help him not to use his right of veto. You want to know? I asked him to make a child with me. He didn't want to. You were dead wrong. Be a dentist. Play the part of the fool. I like it. What are you doing here? There was a small thing I couldn't get out of my head. Can you tell me? What is it? What face did you make when I was born? Like this? Or like this? Not at all. It was more like... I did like this. You were happy I was a girl. For a boy, I would have said "eww". I would have thrown him out of the window. You would have kept him. I would have hesitated. Fortunately, it was a little female mole, not a boy. You're asking me all the time. You should know, you were there. I was too much of a baby to remember. That's not an excuse. I won't tell you what face I made anymore if you can't tell me what face you made when you saw me the first time. Think about it. Use your memory. Like on the pictures. Show me. Not far. You thought right away: "If this is my father smiling stupidly, "I'd rather not see at all." Babies can't see a thing the first day. You can't see a thing once you've seen your father. It's too horrible. Except if you're not too disappointed the first time. Then you don't become blind. What I'm telling you is really scientific. You were expecting better, right? I understand. Stop chatting to avoid going to bed. Go to bed. Why doesn't Gaelle sleep here? She'd rather we are together when you're here. She knows you take good care of me. She also has her cat. One time it's the cat, one time it's me so that I'm not jealous of the cat. You can tell her to sleep here tonight. You'd want her cat to die of hunger? So you're actually a cat killer? - Go to bed. - Stop! Why don't you want to make a baby with me? You never asked. I'm asking now. I never thought about it. I'm too young to have children. Nobody wants to make a baby with me. What's wrong with you? Are you having a panic attack? I thought you hated twisted bellies and tits ready to burst? I'm feeling dizzy for lack of sugar. It can happen. Sex for other reasons than sheer pleasure is absolutely stupid. Thank you for bringing me back to my senses. Are you sleeping here tonight? I'm leaving you in your daughter's arms. Wait. We could invite her and her dentist for dinner. For you or your daughter? Think. We'd have a huge discount on canines, or even things for free. Teeth stopping, bridges. - I can't cook for four people. - It's easy. If you want, we can all go on a vacation together this summer. We'll have time to like each other and try recipes. You're right. Food would be too disgusting here. You could poison them. Let's get invited. You're not funny. But endearing. What now? Nobody wants to make a baby with me. Do you think it's fair? Why do you want to make a baby with her? I don't know. I'm just asking. If she likes cats, she can't like rat faces like you. That must be it. Time to sleep. Can you sing me to sleep? If you close your eyes. You'll never be the nice minstrel for Gaelle, right? I'm your personal minstrel. You know that. I'm sure Max's mother has a lot of jewelry. She could lend us some of it. Can you come for a sec? Could your mother lend us a small but beautiful ring? - To do what? - For you and Zoe to get married. - We're getting married? - We have to if we are in love. - How do we get married? - I'll do it. - With the ring. - Yes. My mother will never agree to give me one of her rings. She likes them too much. It's not going to happen. We can't have a marriage without a ring. - Must we have a ring? - Yes, we do. I will think about it then. There's nothing more beautiful than those women's work. Do they realize the treasures I am forced to sell? An archeologist digging out an old dinosaur's rib is classier to those assholes. I've been seeing your big hand for two minutes. What were you thinking? That I couldn't see it? I was wondering about it. I feel better now. Remove it. If you don't, I will have to take it. You'd regret it. Well done. Do you want to go to the hotel with me? I just want to be under your arm. I miss your smell. I can't smell anything. Actually, I smell leather and your student's perfume, slightly. You're afraid that one day, I won't remember. One day, I'll even forget wanting this smell. When was the last time you went to a hotel in the afternoon? The answer's no. You're waiting until you get pregnant? You're a fool. You don't care. Renew the offer once it means something to you. You're right. I don't want to. I have sex with the others. No with you anymore. You wouldn't want me if you met me? Look at what I got by email this morning. It looks like the one we bought in Fez. You're right. I'm going to go back treasure hunting soon. Let's go. - Will you be gone for long? - No. One week. Not yet. Will you call from there? Yes, on your cell phone. On the sly. Will you kiss me? How? You know. Fuck. Have you noticed? I took a furtive glance to check if somebody could see us. It's pathetic. Missing you is a part of me. Do you understand? No, I'm too stupid. I don't like such cheap sentences. If somebody heard you, they could think I taught you this bullshit. - Gaelle? - Do I know you? Yes and no. I'm Aya's boyfriend. Can we talk for a second? Yes, I'm listening. They see each other all the time. - I know. - No, you don't. They met three or four times these last two weeks. - You're still not worried? - No. She never looked this happy before. I can breathe as well as under a glass cloche. I can breathe as usual. Are you sure he loves you? You get intimate quick. I'm her lover and we'll have a baby soon. I believe she's happy about me and that I can really satisfy her. You're lucky to be so sure about what others feel. Men's feelings... They often elude me. I won't even mention mine. You're answering like this to drive me mad, right? I don't know why I would confide in you. I would have felt better if you'd told me he's crazy about you. He cannot love anyone seriously. He will make a mess with my life. He drives women mad. Don't let him around my woman. I must be the police? Yes, because I'm his opposite. I'm good at happiness and harmony. You cannot imagine. You don't think you're overdoing it? No. You have no idea how much it would help if you were the one for him. You don't think I'm charming enough? Not funny enough? Pretty, yes. I don't know about funny. I'm the one for him. I'm sure of it. She's not the one he needs. She never was. They have nothing to do together. Their time together is over. I know how to reassure you. I'm young. He believes in youth like there's no tomorrow. He'll dump me for a younger girl. - Are you feeling better now? - A little bit. I won't spend my life with him anyway. You won't grow old with her either. They'll end up alone. It will suit them. Why wouldn't she? How do you dare to say bullshit like this? I'm not the one who came to you. I can't do anything except kiss you to comfort you. With the tongue? No. I don't know why I said that. I don't need to be comforted. I don't feel like comforting anyone. When my brother died, I didn't ask anyone to kiss me on the lips. Is the dentist at your place? He's at a conference. It sucks to split up and come to see you when it gets too strong. It sucks and it's almost comical. - No? - Yes. I've had too much to drink. Do you think I'm going to start living this hell with you again? Don't you want to talk with me? I don't know why I'm here. What shall we do? I remember. I've come to give you back your keys. You shouldn't let me have your keys if you live with another girl. You've kept the keys from this place? Stop. You don't think it drives me mad to be attracted by you without being able to resist? Kick me out. Will you stop with your histrionics? I lived with you for five years. It ended. I was the big culprit. You sentenced me. I paid your debt to your society without parole. For what? For good behavior? You almost refused to see me one to one until today. - Kick me out. - You're pissing me off. Get out, then. You're a nice guy, aren't you? You can't kick a girl out. Stop that. Fuck. I'm leaving. - Do you like your job? - Yes. Really? I thought it was only about money. Come Lina, it's time to go to bed. Say good night. Good night. I'll go with you. What would you do in the countryside? Look at chicken's asses laying eggs? Wonderful. So organic. Learn the name of the birds? Pretend to love it? Even though all those birds are more stupid than a goldfish. You look upset. Are you upset? Yes, you look upset. Are you upset? I can't believe we're doing this. What? We don't exist anymore. We all pretend to be interested in each other. It's disgusting. - Go to bed by yourself, okay? - Okay. Good night, little monster. If that's how you feel, you'll never get pregnant with his child. What were you talking about? About us. About what? Tell me. Gaelle thinks we should meet, the two of us. Since you see each other without us, we could do the same. It's a great idea. All would become simpler. You would leave me? Yes. You could meet Louis at your heart's content. I'm not sure I'm the right person. I don't suit many people. I get upset right away. Why? You look too much like a teenager. I was never really a teenager. Except with my father. I hated him for abandoning me for all those women. I've ended up with someone who loves women as much as my father. I'll go see Lina. Come. Surprised is surprised the story is like this. He is surprised it ends like this. He would have wanted the hero to have wings. Crazy would have wanted the story to end badly. Happy is very happy because it's the first story he's inventing. Even if he's a little bit sad, he's very happy. Sad cries all the time. He'd like to stop crying, but he can't. He's sad. This is Furious. He gets upset over nothing. He's Sad's father. He would have liked his son to be happy. Too bad his son is Sad. Go to bed now. I feel better, yes. I couldn't breathe. It was our fifth date. It doesn't count if we are four. I will decide the fifth date, if there is one. The four of us together was my idea. You could have told me it'd be a disaster. Calm down, there is no reason to cry. I'm not crying. You look as if you're going to cry. What's wrong? This is depressing. I'm going to explain Louis to you. He doesn't feel nostalgic. He's immature enough to want everything. Why wouldn't he have fun seducing her again? What a nice guy. - He's getting me nervous now. - He hasn't decided yet. He'll improvise and he'll be okay. She's the threat. She could accept his playing that stupid role again. He can play with a lot of convictions to not disappoint her. She's the threat. Lock her in your house. It will fix everything. Would you mind giving me your cell phone number? I might have some stupid advice to ask you again. Let's go. I'm exhausted. Thank you. You were great. Everybody's making and effort and she goes to hide in Lina's room. If she were less pretty, you wouldn't be so annoyed. He'll always choose them pretty. It comforts him. He hasn't gotten better at all. Do you really wish them well as a couple? You're annoying. She thinks like me. It'd be better if the two of you kept on meeting. That's what she thinks? You mean you want to be the only one he loves? She cannot do it? Why didn't you look for me in your daughter's room? Your ex wouldn't have liked it? You didn't realize I wasn't okay. Victor ran after you. He's a considerate guy. You don't realize that a guy who takes care of her and fucks her good is not only a perfect guy, but also a blessing for me. I just might become addicted to him, since he's so useful. Maybe it's my fault. I can't picture myself with anyone. I'm desperately looking for a guy I could love. And I'm not the guy? I'm not sure. I'm having doubts tonight. A lot of doubts. It's my fault. I don't expect enough from men. You don't want him to sleep at your place. Not tonight. Come on, I won't put your cat in the toilet. - We'll do it if we all agree. - He agrees. You must tell me the words for the wedding stuff. I don't know anything about it. What do I have to say? Ask if it's yes or no and we'll answer yes. Aren't there phrases that sound more wedding-like? Yes, there is 'holy matrimony'. So here it goes: "In holy matrimony, "do you want to marry XXX?" Then, you can kiss each other. I wanted to tell you. I'd like you to find me beautiful. I'd like to seduce you in the middle of all that. You're a clever and dangerous girl. What are you doing here? I was thirsty and my glass was empty. I forgot to fill it up. Who is here? Gaelle? - What? - Who is it? Gaelle? No, it's your mother. She's asleep. She was tired. Why is she here? She has nightmares, like you. I'm a specialist on nightmares-calming. I don't want her to sleep here. I'd like to wake her up. Let her sleep, it'd be nicer. You'll see her at school tomorrow. She'll pick you up. I'm up. - You were thirsty? - Yes. Are you going to bed? Sleep tight, my beautiful girl. Are you going to pout long? I'm upset at you, it's not the same. I'm going to a birthday party tonight. We could decide I come back to your place tomorrow. It's your choice. You need to fool around with other boys. Did you tell Aya you loved her? When you doubt your feelings for me, I'm no longer interested. So tell me. I don't have any doubt about what I feel. Are you okay? Yes. A little bit better. There's a picture at your place. I hate it. On the picture, there is a dirty car windshield with 'Hugs' written on it. I'd be glad if I could not see that picture anymore. You could tell me where it is, because I cannot find it. We were supposed to patch things up. Don't get nostalgic on me. I'm not interested. Burning and tearing up all the crap you had before me is the least you could do. It makes me upset. Let's meet. In one hour. Find a way. You understand what I just did? Tell me. If you end it with her, I'll end it with him. Him in exchange of her. Who is he? He's not allowed to call me. I call him when it's convenient for me. We meet at his place and he must find his wife something to do. What has he done to you for you to treat him like this? I should be with him. Not with you. If we hadn't screwed up... We were supposed to get married when I heard he was still screwing the girl he left for me. Rings any bell? So when we're together, you fuck him? - Why are you telling me this? - Because we're going to break up. You slept with your ex. I'm doing the same. It's not a good start. - We're going to break up? - If you don't end it with her. That guy doesn't mean much to me. - If he doesn't, it's a bad deal. - You're right. It's not a good exchange. A little lover isn't much compared to Aya. SECOND PART "IF OUR KIDS ARE GOING TO TELL ON US, WE MIGHT AS WELL BE GUILTY." I'll show you something great. - Guess what I have in my pocket. - A book. Would a book fit in my pocket? - Are you serious? - No. - Do you want a hint? - Yes. It's something you find in weddings. Come on, say something. Flowers? No, I don't have any. They would stick out. Do you want another hint? The man always has it. A ring. I'll tell you later. It's so beautiful. It's for the wedding? - With? - Max. You'll have to tell me where you want to do it. In the playground, everybody will see us. - Except if it's in the toilet. - No, not there. Girls, we're late. We're late. I'll call you back. If Gaelle had entered the room, it wouldn't have upset me more. Such a shame. Your lover's going to know I come to your place. Maybe not. Lina will tell on you when she benefits from it. Fuck them. Both of them. Sometimes, I don't love Lina. I don't love her. I've never loved her. If this feeling lasted, it would drive me crazy. I'll be back in two minutes. Hello, do you have a room available? - One night? - Yes. Is this a threat? If our kids are going to tell on us... At last. With girls these days, you don't even have sex after the sixth date. Are you scared? What about you? Me too. - Are you okay? - Yes, I'm good. - What did you do? - I loafed around. With a girlfriend? No. With my lover. A few years ago, I went back to Brittany in the village where I used to spend my vacation as a kid. The beach had become tiny. It was fun. I hate cold water but I went in with unbelievable delight. On the 31st of December of that year, I could have said: "This is the best time." I think my excitation showed in my eyes. It's what I see in your eyes right now. I was deluding myself. I guess you saw Louis this afternoon? I wish you wouldn't see him, because such eyes are hard on me. Well done. I'm afraid you're deluding yourself too. Yes, I saw him. In life, you're very self-conscious and intelligent, but when you're playing at being the Eternal Return Woman, it lacks subtlety. Your eyes, in Brittany. They must have been magnificent. I wish I had seen you with them. When you see them on me, they become ugly and unbearable. I wish things could go really well between us. I don't like jealous men. You're right. I want to fuck. Did you have time to take a bath, or did he jump on you like I did? No. Against what did he press you? The room's closet. A hotel room? Of course. Did he enter you right away? He threw me on the floor and then he did. He threw you on the floor? Did you blow him? - Did you blow him or not? - Of course I did. Did you think about me? Did you think about me? I don't think so. After the wedding, I'll take the ring back. Otherwise, my mother will look for it everywhere. To make it a real wedding, I must sleep with the ring on my finger. - Are you sure? - Yes. - But you'll give it back tomorrow. - Of course. Max! What? We have the ring. Do you still want to marry Zoe and never look at another girl again? - I don't know. - You promised. I didn't promise anything. Plus, Zoe's a baby. Let's not talk about promises. You said it, that's all. Okay then... - Have you seen the ring? - It's teeny-tiny. Have you seen the diamond? Max, do you want to be joined to Zoe in holy matrimony? - I didn't hear anything. - I said yes. I haven't said anything. Zoe, do you want to be joined to Max and only Max in holy matrimony? Don't show it to anyone. Otherwise my mother will kill me. You didn't even give me a kiss and you... - Was it okay? - Yes. - What have you learned today? - Compound past. Really... Yes, really. I'm not in the pictures anymore? I was taken down everywhere. Did Victor do it? When you're dead, I'll hang one. I promise. Thank you. You really don't have to. Before, when I saw a picture of us, I felt happy nostalgia. Our past together was always wonderful. Of course, I made everything ugly. Sometimes, it feels as if it never existed. You're right. We didn't experience anything together. Don't think about it and think about your five strongest memories. The most obvious. The images that come to mind by themselves. Don't rush it. Five memories between you and me. You'll see the difference. What will that prove? We didn't experience anything together. Everything on our own. Isn't that what you want? Mom? I'm coming. So, do you have them? You're chickening out. I'll start then. I'll start blind. One. You. Naked on an unknown beach. Rue du Touquet. Sand everywhere. Two. You. Kiss. One of the first times. Standing on a building's landing. It's still night. You're wearing tights. We're bothered by people leaving their apartment. Three. Me. So amazingly calm. In the private hospital's room. Right before Lina's birth. Four. You and me, on the brown and black carpet. The fashionable carpet. It's early in the morning. You don't want to. You want only that. Five. You and me. Rue de Buci. In the beginning. We should break up. You must go home. We can't do it. It lasts for hours. It's almost only about sex. You made a mistake about the girl wearing garters on the landing. Who was she? Céline? It sounds like her. It's pathetic. Only the sex in the elevator is missing. I didn't last long. How many do you have in common with me? Only one. Shall I kill myself? I don't like myself with him anymore. I'm starting to really hate myself with you. I love Victor much more than I say. It'd be best if I didn't see you. We shouldn't see each other. I love the strongest, so it's a decision I have a right to make. I'm going to have a baby with him. You're leaving me because now you know you can have a baby with me. You're a coward. Go away. The first time we broke up, you were relieved. This time, I hope you miss me and that you suffer, even though I doubt it. Thank you. What are you doing? I'm crying. Have you done your homework? Yes, with mom. She went to the supermarket to shop. What? - Do you want to play a game? - What game? I'm very sad because I think my prince will never wake up. I'm walking with the head like this. Leaned like this? Yes, so that I'm very sad. Do you want to be the prince? Lie down and sleep. - Now. - So I'll be the prince? Yes, do it. Faster. Like this? Yes, move. When you're in love, can you sleep with your former husband? If you're a happy princess, you can do whatever you want. - Not that, but... If you're separated... If you're separated... Mom still sleeps next to my father. My father's very weird. I didn't know. I do. It's crazy. Are you sure? Yes. I was at my father's and mom... ...slept in his room. Because of her "nightmares". In theory, it's forbidden. I wasn't happy at all. I'm not sure I still want to play. Hi, mom. Are you okay? You don't look so good. Have Lina and you fought? You're the one I want to fight with. Why? I'm told you've been sleeping next to Louis. You were told. Your daughter told me. It must be true then. Did she tell you I slept with my clothes on? - No? - I don't know. With me, you sleep naked. I didn't know you slept with your clothes on with him. Ask better questions to your spy. I didn't ask. Then do it better. What is it? You wanted to know if it's right or wrong to sleep next to your father? I don't care. I'll tell you. First, I'm glad to have such a virtuous daughter. Considering your parents, it must have missed one generation. As to whether it's right or wrong to sleep next to your father, and since we're separated and I live with Victor, the answer is that it's wrong. What your mother does is wrong. If I want to meet your father, you can never be a judge and refuse to speak to me or hug me. If you already start judging your parents, you're off to a bad start in life. If you do this ever again, I'll abandon you abroad on the road side. You won't ever find your way back. It doesn't mean everything I do is good. But not everything I do is of your concern. It's none of your business. Virtuous means the opposite of bad. There is something else. My ring with the small diamond has disappeared. - Did you play with it? - I never play with your rings. I believe you. I'm going to start suspecting everyone. That means Victor or the cleaning lady. Obviously, Victor didn't do it. I trust Monica more than I trust myself. So I don't get it. You'll find it back. One day, you put it somewhere without paying attention. You're right. It's not so bad anyway. I didn't plan on getting buried with it. He comes and you relapse. You don't want to, but still you go. It's not good for you but you can't resist. That guy's like cocaine. Is your life with me sad? I shouldn't meet him anymore. Dream on. Do you think you're enough for me? I won't see him anymore. I won't. Delphine, it's Louis. Listen. Since I don't feel obliged to eat diner alone, if you're available... I think the only thing I could offer you is sexual pleasure. I said that, but... But no, not tonight. Not now. I don't feel like it. All things considered, I don't want to. You neither? Why are you so upset then? Bye. The answering machine. Great. Céline, I wanted to say to your answering machine that you can erase this. Yes, erase. I wanted to tell you... I mean... Lina's having fun with Gaelle. Imagine Gaelle leaves. Lina would be bored with me. I could be less selfish and ask Gaelle to come back if being alone with Lina stresses me out too much. That was so stupid. So stupid. You can cross the city as fast as Buster Keaton. You enter the hotel like a hurricane. When you climb the stairs, you're faster than the elevator. Don't stop. But get your breath back. You are getting close to the door. You can open. I'm not afraid of you. Come in. You're not knocking? You're not here. My heart feels heavy, it means you're not well. You don't dare to call me. You'll die too. Maybe you're serious. Should I call you? The answering machine. Don't cry again. Always tears. Just one tear. Do it. Violaine, let me speak. I have big news for you. I'm fascinated by the love Aya could still give me. I want to win her love back. I know, such phrases are funny. I can do it, though. I'm not devoid of a heart. It's quite something to see a charming and respectable guy like me die of love for an admirable woman with breasts to play with day and night. You barely touch the tits. You pinch them terribly. And the jerks of her ass when she orgasms... What? Okay, see you. You really want us to never meet again? Okay, then. Not okay. Lord, I want to talk to You. He's the one who forced me to come back here. I'm waiting for him. That's all. I wanted to tell you... I didn't hang on to Gaelle. It's Aya's fault. She did everything so that I'd take some of my love for her in the beds of others. Nothing stops me from going to see Gaelle and tell her it's over. I did everything I could not to love you completely, but now, I enter your bed naked. I have nothing with me anymore. Loving you doesn't mean realizing sometimes I can do it. It's much more often. It's almost all the time. All the time. Have I ever told you about Gaelle? I'm not sure. See you. THIRD PART "I'M NOT SURE I THINK ABOUT EGG-LAYING ALL THE TIME..." What is this? I didn't think you'd come. I wanted to tell you. We don't see you anymore. We talk about you all the time. It's almost forbidden. Your importance has become much exaggerated. It's okay to meet. It's okay if you see her again. She'd be happy to see you again. - Are you kidding? - No, I'm serious. Call her. Meet her. And everything will be back in order. Don't toy with feelings that aren't yours. That would be despicable. What do you know about my feelings? I do whatever I please. I'll call her if I want. As you wish. You're the one calling to set a date. At first glance, it's a gentlemanly move. You think she'll appreciate it and that you'll benefit from it? She mustn't be in a good place for you to stoop to being this generous. You want to stay in control? Deep down, you're not giving anything. That's not your style. Your comments are only interesting up to a point. Okay. I have plenty of appointments this afternoon. You think she needs you to see me again? Asshole. Why do think I'm asking you to meet her? So you've decided for me? I don't always decide what I like. He called me. I don't think I'm going to go. Hello. May I come in? Who are you? She didn't want to come. I was asking too much. I'm asking too much. That's the message? You've come to tempt me? I'm here in someone's stead. I can improvise. I start like this because this isn't a café. We're in the hotel room where you told me to come. What about the other? The one who's probably waiting in a café? What does she think? She told me: "Make him confused, "gain some time, "and tell him I'm not that much into him." If I understand well, the other has hired a girlfriend to do what she cannot do anymore? Yes. She doesn't know if it's worth questioning her relationship. She's not sure her ex is worth it. I don't have to play with you. I don't have a date with you. I'm replacing her. You don't really feel what she feels. I don't know how you can claim to be replacing her. I know her well. She's got so much stage fright she doesn't know how to play the part. It's better if I represent her. It can't be worse. I know human emotions. I can play them all. I miss her. I'm talking about the one who can't come to me. Is it funny to sleep with the guy your girlfriend's in love with? I don't know. I'll tell you after. Undress. What's funny is what she says. People ideally slotting each other, and I'm not only talking about sex. She realized that's what she had with you. Not anyone else. That pre-established harmony thing she claims to have years after the fact makes me laugh. That fusion. She would have told me that with a little bit less irony. If you don't mind me giving you advice about the character. Come closer. So you can confirm this bullshit? Dreams of fusion, pre-established harmony, etc.? I haven't come here to fuck. You're in a hotel room with a half-naked girl, so why have you come? You're a turn-on. But having cheap sex with me is pathetic. I can already hear you telling Aya: "What you told me was wrong, Honey. "That guy is not a lover. "He's a fucking fucker of a fuck." If she had come, you would have fucked her, right? Why should we only have cheap sex? You're a very bad kisser. If I were her, I would have left already. You cannot adapt to a new situation. Kiss me for real or I'm going to think this is the wrong room. Shut up! There are feelings with her. We're only going to fuck. I want her. Not you. You're making my life very hard. I'm sorry. It was the eight date. I have no sense of humor today. No wonder she's hesitating. She's afraid of a new disaster with you. You're never satisfied. But I'm okay with anything. I'm like a baby having fun with everything. I have only questions and no answers. That's why. I don't like you when you're a baby. I don't care. I get it back. It is either life or death. With death, you never give it back to me and you're never at peace. With life, you give it back and you're always at peace. - So at peace or not at peace? - At peace. I think my mother is going to call yours. I'm going to tell my mother you stole it. - The day of my birthday. - Lina ? Yes, what? What's up with that ring? I've lent Zoe the ring you offered mom. That's kind. Why did you lend it to her? Because she's in love with Max and Max too. If they're in love, she can keep it. Anyway, your mother doesn't wear it anymore. It must live on a finger again. You don't get that her mother took it. She's going to call mom. It's getting complicated. I wish mom would keep it so that I can have it later. If you want to get it, that's your problem. I thought you were going to fix everything. I'm too much of a coward. It's normal I'm afraid of mom, but it's not normal you are. Did your experience of life teach you that? You're wrong. I don't need such a coward father. Like you, for instance. I understand. What's with that ring thing? I don't know. You don't know? It's funny, because I talked with Zoe's mother on the phone. It's Zoe. She wanted to marry Max as a joke. Then she told me she wanted to play at getting married. She told me she couldn't find the ring back. Maybe her mother found it? Really? So it's basically her mother's fault? No, because she's the one who found it. You shouldn't steal from me like that. Rings can be given back. What does that mean? Your father gave me that ring. Do you think he'd be happy to know you gave it to a friend? I don't know. He probably doesn't care at all. Yes, he does. Don't steal from me, then. Okay. Do your homework. We missed each other. I didn't have the courage to face him. Have you decided not to see him anymore? I didn't meet him. You didn't? Not really. When I listen to music by myself, I feel good. You don't exist. I cheat on you much more when I do that. When do you meet him? Maybe Sunday. I'll be with Lina. I don't want to meet him alone. Or with a girlfriend. It's still fragile, but it's trying to improve. Kiss fight! One, two, three. The dad's here. Dad. A dad in sight. A little kiss for dad. It was a kitten kiss. Get up, kitten. Big cat. This is a tiny stroll. I'm going to tell Victor. It's forbidden to make us hold hands. If I'm the one doing it, it's okay. She's right. You see, I'm always right. Where are you going? Pick some little flowers. This is the ninth date. It's still the eight. With your hotel friend, it doesn't count. This isn't a little flower. This isn't a little flower. We'll end up in jail. We'll end up in jail. I kissed him. But I'm staying with you. Deal with it. Apparently, Victor left. Yes. Is it because dad is coming back home? That's what you think? No, the two of us are going somewhere. Where? We're going home to get our traveler stuff. - Will Victor go too? - I don't think so. He's going to drive around to calm down. They both think I'm crazy. An intelligent man is limited, two are even worse. I'm almost free and they don't even realize it. - Do I have the face of a madwoman? - No. Let's go get our stuff. Do I take my notebooks and my books? Yes. School with me is going to be amazing, you'll see. Let's leave like thieves. Then we must steal something. What do we steal? A painting and then we sell it. Okay. What painting? The lion. This is not a real painting. Plus, it's mine. - Take something that isn't ours. - Money. Yes, let's search Victor's pockets. Hurry. We'll find a lot of coins. And maybe a bill. That scrooge didn't put anything. He didn't think about us. He actually thought about us. That's why there's nothing. Let's go. Don't worry, I have his credit card. That's better. - You admire me? - I do. I'm not hiding her anywhere and I know nothing. You can search the apartment if you want. What happened between us to make her leave with Lina? I don't know. What about the last time you met? We kissed. I know. Do you think we're supposed to meet later and I'm wasting my time with you? You want to have a baby with a woman you don't understand at all? Where do we look for her? I'm in a bad mood. I don't understand a thing and you know everything. I'll go with you. You'd better because you'll never find her alone. I hope you have a fancy dentist car. I like those. You know, she'd be very happy to see us together. Enough. Why are you so unpleasant? Because I won't let you destroy her. "I won't let you destroy her." - Is it a pagoda? - Yes. If we can't find her in a pagoda... You think I want to destroy her? Do I look like a murderer? - She's my woman. - She was. - Not anymore. - You know that's not true. You're a thief, buddy. Just a thief. Could you at last tell me where we're going? I give you the address and you find her by yourself. She'll think you're the perfect guy and she'll go back with you. She'll know right away I'm the one who tipped you. Do you think you'll be protected for long once you're back home? She'll still meet me. So we have to arrive together. We don't have a choice. It'll be endless otherwise. Get out of my car and you'll see if I have no choice. I'll show you the hotel where you started your life in my womb. Let's see if you can recognize the room. - Are we going to sleep there? - Yes, together. I want another child. With whom? - Dad? - No, with Victor. What? Am I not enough? No. Plus, if I take the same father, I'll get another rat face. Mole face. Mole? Do you think I want to breed moles? Do you think I'll be as happy the second time? I doubt it. Plus, I'd prefer a boy. Let's pick up where we left off. You stole my woman and it didn't cost you a thing. You were separated. I didn't steal anything. You have a debt to pay to society. You must pay damages to the victims. How much are you worth as a victim? Sometimes you're someone. Sometimes, you feel you're nothing. Right now, I'm not worth anything. I'm a bargain. Take advantage of it. I can't afford to refuse even a mediocre offer. Of course, with Aya, it gets expensive. You must buy them both. You can't sell her off. You must find a compromise. We'll see if she's hiding in one of our places. If so, you're screwed, buddy. Do you want to bet? With my money? I'm done talking to you. Pay first. You're afraid she won't be where we're going. You're having serious doubts. So you must compensate with money. I'm starting to like that you're insecure. Put the money between us. I'm going to empty the next ATM. It's yours. And all the ATMs until we arrive. I'm going to give you dough, buddy. You'll see. Amazing. Do you recognize the room? - It was here? - Yes. It was winter. It was very cold. - You made love to warm up. - Exactly. Right here. Take this. Later. In an envelope. What do you have in common with Aya? I can't figure you out. Neither in a group or in a space where I could understand. - Were you married? - Yes. - What? - A husband. A serial husband. People always like that. I always refused to get married. Aya must love that in you. In what group are you? Serial fucker? Shit stirrer? Can't you talk casually all the time? We look stupid. What are you doing? I'm counting the waves. But I actually really want to pee. I can count for you if you want. How many? 39. I trust you. Count. 40. 41. 42. 43. 56. 57. - How many? - 58. 59. If you die, who's going to take care of me? Dad or Victor? Dad. But I don't really want to die. But you're allowed to be tired of me sometimes. I'm never tired of you. I do, sometimes. Sometimes, I'm really tired of you. You piss me off. When I piss you off, what do you want to do? Put you in a trash can. Well done. And then? I throw you in the water. - You throw me in the water? - Yes. - Very far in the sea. - Not the sea. In the countryside. With earth on you. Then we spit apple seeds on it. - Good evening, sir. - Good evening. Have my wife and my daughter arrived? - Mrs. Berthod. - I'll check. Yes, they are here. Can you check if you have an empty room? Yes, I'll check. - Here. - Come on, it's okay. Now that there is no doubt, there is no need for money. You don't know this place, but I... It's as if I heard a finch sing. Nostalgia. From the Greek nostos, return, and algos, sickness. The return sickness. The only remedy for you is to return home. Mine is to go upstairs. We have a room available. - Okay. Your name, please. - Stahl. It's me. I'm downstairs. Can I come up? Are you alone? I'll see you tomorrow morning. You don't mind? Okay. Can you call Mrs. Berthod's room, please? Of course. Here you go. Yes? It's me. Can I come up? This is a girls' night out. Boys are not invited. - What? - We are surrounded. - Who? Dad? - Dad and Victor. We can play cards with them. He didn't know how to swim. He asked a lifeguard to teach him. The lifeguard was shocked but said yes. Can you wait before you finish? Somebody knocked on the door. I'll be back soon. My story. What game are you playing? You come together now? Did you place bets? It's not a game. Whom am I supposed to seduce? He told me you were here. I hadn't told him anything. I know. He guessed. You've become inseparable? You're the one who went to see him. We were supposed to make a baby together. How is that coming along? I'm not sure I think about egg-laying all the time. Do you mind if we shut up? I didn't come to blame you. Don't look so desperate. I didn't come for this either. I know. So what? I didn't ask for anything. I wouldn't be able to entertain you tonight. What can I do for you? Good evening. Can I have the number of Louis Stahl's room? You're even right across the hall. I love you. So what? You cannot stay here. She refused to see me. I barely drank. She didn't allow me to enter the room. I don't know what I mean to her anymore. I don't get it anymore. You mean a lot to her. Obviously. Stop. I want to get drunk. You won't get wasted with what's in the mini-bar. I asked for a bottle of wine. This is better. I want to have a child with her so that she'll be out of my life. Do you understand? I don't want to have a child with her anymore. It's over. You're nuts. You're a fool. - What? - You're a fool. What are you doing? Give me your hand. "Give me your hand." Here. I don't want to get married. You're going to marry my daughter's mother. You don't want to marry my daughter's mother? No, I don't want to. I've had enough. What? Are you sad? You didn't see. Behind you. Everything's fine. Here. It's going to smell. It's going to smell like alcohol. - Don't bother, I... - Enough! I sleep with my clothes on. I don't need bed sheets. - It's okay. - Don't bother. You know it's going to smell like alcohol. She is sucking us dry. She's a vampire. That's true. She takes all the blankets. When I wake up in the morning, I'm cold and I always catch a cold with her. You see? Me, I was always too hot with her. Don't worry. Do it. We don't want you to... We don't want you to take all the blankets. You always take them for yourself. Is this an ultimatum? Yes. We were bound to talk about it someday. First, it's not true. I don't take all the blankets. I'll prove it to you. I'll both take you to bed and we'll see who takes the blanket. Go to bed. You too. Time to sleep. Silence now. Time to sleep. Close your eyes. You too. Yes, I'll keep the light on in the hallway. He's the one who takes the blankets. I heard you. Sleep and shut up. Good night. Mandatory stroll on the beach. I'm coming. Right now. We won't wait for the latecomers. Don't give orders to your father like this. Jump in his arms, hug him. Ask him if he slept well. I didn't sleep well. Right now. Mom's waiting for us downstairs. Hurry. You were supposed to go. I didn't want to. You should leave me alone. He's not the man for you. You can't spend your life with a man whose armpits smell like deodorant. It's disgusting. His smell on his pillow is quite strong. It's like the goat smell of a man who doesn't wash much. You're talking about my smell. That part of me is irresistible. Can I go take a walk with my daughter? You cannot stay here. I wish I were an animal. Yes, a cheetah, I know. You're not lucky, because I don't care about animals, even rabbits. There isn't one you like a little bit? A bird to fly and to sing too. What bird? - A seagull. - A seagull? It poops on people. It's all hot and liquid. That's why I like them. They poop on people who say: "I like the seashore a lot." You wouldn't prefer a golden eagle? If you want. I'm not a bird. I'm a cheetah. So you're going to stay on the ground? Yes, but I'm the fastest runner in the world. - You can't catch me. - You think so? I'm going to get you, lion. I'm a cheetah! Did you sleep well? Do you think we can trust him to take care of Lina? I'll dig a huge hole. Like this, it's good. - Tell me, Lina. - What? Do you have the key card to the room? Yes. Can you give it to me? Are you crazy? You owe me something. I don't know, money? How much do you want? 20 euros. Is this the birdling or the seagull talking? I'll never give you 20 euros. I'll give you two euros. - Two euros? - Yes. To someone like me? It's not worth it. - How much then? - Six euros. - Five. - Deal. I'll put everything inside. - What are you going to do? - I'll be back. What is he going to do again? I like seashores. It feels as if he's in the room. I can draw the curtains so that you can think of another woman. Do you realize you don't love us at all? No, that's not true. He and I are being offended, humiliated. It's unbearable. Unbearable offenses and humiliations. I cannot compete. It was about time he came back. That's good. I'll marry your daughter. - She said she'd wait for you? - Yes. Like you waited for Louis. Maybe. I was always more interested in her. In ten years, I'll still be very young. I seduced the mother to marry the daughter later. Don't tell me she's going to change her mind. Her shoes are going to get soaked. She's not wearing any. I see. What? What is it? I'm sorry to be so bad at loving you. I was frivolous the first time. You'll have to believe in it. It looks like a tree. Look. There is a strength in us you can't imagine. One must dive, not wade. Since you know so much about weddings, could you marry your father and your mother? But you need a ring. I have one. It's a great ring. I'll give you mine. This is a ring? I got it from my mother who got it from her grandmother. It'll be yours one day. Be careful. I won't. Louis, in holy matrimony, do you want to marry Aya, Lina's mother? I do. Do you want to be joined to Louis... - ...in? - Holy matrimony. Why holy? It doesn't matter. Marriage is very holy. - Go ahead, then. - I do. Of course. Maybe. Wait, you're supposed to give it, right? Or is it you? I declare you... I'm supposed to say it. I declare you husband and wife. We're supposed to kiss. Can we? Okay. I'm coming. What? What is it? - Would you bath in that icy thing? - No, it's actually not tempting. - Really? You'll see. - Help! In the water! Mom! Mom! I'm the champion. Stop! Not in the water!
