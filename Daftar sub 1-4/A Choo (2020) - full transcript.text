Hsin-hsin. Can you see this? This doesn't hurt at all. Not this one, nor this one. Nothing can hurt me. Not these punches. I could dodge, but I let him hit me. I did it on purpose, because you said you like brave guys. I want to tell you. I'm different now. I've become stronger and braver. I can already protect you. I can totally protect you. From now on, I won't let you shed a tear. Once upon a time, the government scientists discovered a new element, the Hyper Matrix. The evil Dr. Cube invaded their lab, trying to steal the Matrix. Flash, my favorite superhero, came to stop Dr. Cube. FLASH Dr. Cube was no match for Flash. To stop him from getting away, Flash used his signature attack, but accidentally struck the Matrix in half. A strong energy was released. Dr. Cube merged with half of the Matrix and turned into a monster. The worst part was that it caused an explosion. Kids lost their parents overnight and became orphans. Flash disappeared after the incident. Dr. Cube became the biggest villain and nobody could defeat him. Fortunately, Sonic appeared. He could shatter the Matrix with his powers. Sonic wasn't afraid of Dr. Cube and defeated him eventually. Finally, he became the city's superhero. Dr. Cube had to hide underground, trying to gain more power. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. 11, -This is Suiwei Orphanage. -12, 13, -Ten years ago, a big explosion -14, -killed everyone's parents. -15, -Children were left behind -16, 17… at the most unfortunate place in the world. -…19, 20, -Fortunately, -I met her. -21, 22, 23, 24… -35, -Move! 36, 37, 38, 39, 40. 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55… 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100. Anybody here? Help! Hello! -Wang Yi-chih! -Wang Yi-chih! -Wang Yi-chih! -Wang Yi-chih! -Wang Yi-chih! -Hey! Hey! Hsin-hsin! -Wang Yi-chih! -Yi-chih! -Stop playing! Come out now! -Wang Yi-chih! -Yi-chih! -Wang Yi-chih! Help me. Hsin-hsin… Wang-- Come out now! Yi-chih! Wang Yi-chih! Yi-chih! Wang Yi-chih! Wang Yi-chih! Hsin-hsin… Yi-chih! Yi-chih! Wang Yi-chih, wake up! Yi-chih! Wang Yi-chih! That summer, I fell in love with the most beautiful girl. When she smiles at me, it's as if I were in heaven. If we see those bullies again, you should kick him like this and I'll punch him like this. How's that? Or we could just… I'll hold him down and you go lick his ear. What? Why lick his ear? He has sensitive ears. But why me? -You have a bigger tongue. -What? Unwanted losers. Are you still reading garbage comics? I got all the food waste from the kitchen. You can either eat it or shower in it. Get him! Don't run! I thought you wanted to lick his ear! -You guys are troublemakers! -Get them! Don't run! Let's go! -Boss, are you all right? -Quick! -It's gross. You want to take a shower? -You're smelly. -Run quickly! -Where to? -Upstairs! -Shut up! Chase them! You moron! You almost died the last time you hid here. Why are we here again? -Where are you? -Who's dying? -I saw a tunnel here last time. -Damn it. Find them! Where the hell are you? Come out! Both of you, run faster! Where are they? Find them! -Boss, it's haunted here. -Idiot! -There are ghosts here! -Just go! I still want to get married! It's so dark. There's a snake! I wonder where this leads to. Are there any ghosts here? Yes, there are. -You are the ghost. -No, you are! -You are! -Should we keep going? You're so annoying. What the hell! Screw you. What's this place? I think we're outside. It's a secret tunnel. We can sneak out every day. -Let's go, Chien-han. -Wait for me! Yi-chih, where are you going? Chien-han, it's dangerous. What's with the constant thunders? This is weird. Wait, stop running! Calm down, everyone. If the thunder strikes, it would be at the highest point. Those trees are taller than us, so we're safe. -Is that really the tallest tree? -Look, don't be scared. It will hit that tree first, not us. Don't worry! Don't worry! I'm taller than you both, the lightning will hit me first. Get down, Chien-han! Hsin-hsin, don't be afraid! Now, we're taller than you! Look, it's that house. No, I'm scared of ghosts. Don't be a wuss. You're a man. It hurts! Can you walk in front then? Hurry up, idiot! It's Flash. It stinks. You're Flash, right? Is there anyone here? I saw you catching lightning, you must be Flash. Rumor says you eat batteries for food. I ate some, it didn't work. Why isn't he answering? Is he deaf? Flash, I know some people hate you, but we don't. You did what a hero had to do. Go away! I don't know you! I'm not a superhero! Piss off! Can't you see he's ignoring us? He's a coward. Let's go. There's no point staying here. Let's go. I know he must be Flash. -Let's go. -I know why he won't admit it. FLASH CHALLENGES VILLAIN EXPLOSION AT FACTORY MAYOR CRITICIZES PUBLIC PROTESTS ON STREET FLASH CAUSED EXPLOSION AND KILLED CHILDREN FLASH GOES MISSING SECRET DONOR BUILDS AN ORPHANAGE Our punishment for escaping -is being locked up in a room -Hey, aren't you hungry? -and no dinner. -I won't if I don't think about it. It doesn't matter. Chien-han and I are used to it. Have you ever thought of why haven't your parents come for you? They must be doing something great. They'll come get me when I'm older. Will we grow up to be troubled teens? -What? -You can't and you won't! -You're the best, Hsin-hsin. -You're a faithful friend! If you get locked up here, we'll bring you everything from the kitchen. Thank you, dummy. Hsin-hsin, are you leaving? Yes. Do I stay here with you guys then? -That would be great. -I have to go now, silly. -I've made up my mind. -About what? I swear, when I leave the orphanage, I'm never coming back. Also, I'll make Hsin-hsin my wife. No, she will be my wife. Does it matter if that ugly uncle is Flash or not? If I were you, I would try to be someone that is 100 times braver than Flash. I'll never be like him. Even though he's powerful, he's still hiding on the mountain. He doesn't even want to admit who he is. So… You like brave guys? Every girl likes brave guys. Then, if I grow up to be the bravest guy in the universe, you have to marry me, deal? Sure. It's done. And it's a success! Ta-da! Hsin-hsin. Your trimming skills haven't improved at all. Blame it on your ugly face. -Hey, hold on. -Why? I can add this to the retard's food. Move your feet! When will you grow up? I'm off to college in a few days. If you and Chien-han get locked up again, I won't be able to bring you food anymore. You'll have to starve to death. Take good care of yourself. What's that look? I don't want you to go. Soon, you'll leave the orphanage too. Remember to visit me. Will you write to us? No, that's too tiring. I don't care. Fine. Are you retarded? -Bye. -Bye. -Bye. -Take care. -Bye. -Bye. -Bye. -Bye. -Take care. -I'm leaving. You guys should behave. Don't get on people's nerves. -Bye. -Bye. -Bye. -I'm leaving. -Bye. -Bye. -Bye. -Bye. -Bye. -Bye. -Bye. -Bye. -Bye. -Bye. Do miss us. -Bye. -Bye. -Take care of yourself. Bye. -Bye. Wait for me! Hey! Hey! Wait! Where are you going? Wang Yi-chih, Yeh Chien-han. Yi-chih, Chien-han. How are you? I've rented my own place now. It's way better than the orphanage. Without you guys, there's less trouble, but less fun. I just settled in and haven't made any friends, but I'm sure I will. As for both of you, behave yourselves. I can't sneak food for both of you anymore. Wang Yi-chih. Actually, I'm stressed with my studies. Every day, I have endless assignments. But I'll work hard to become a teacher. Wang-- I know both of you hate studying. I should've said I like guys who study hard. Wang Yi-chih, Yeh Chien-han. Right, I'm working at a mall now. I can make money and learn about fashion. Next time you see me, you would be surprised. Hey. Are you afraid of being punished? Not at all. Latest news update. There was a terror attack at ICC. According to our latest update, the main suspect, Dr. Cube and his associates, have caused major explosions. The police have evacuated hundreds of civilians. Sonic has also arrived at the scene to battle Dr. Cube. Stop hitting! It's us! Hey! It's us, Hsin-hsin! It's us! Happy birthday… Happy birthday… Sorry! -Happy birthday to you -Happy birthday to you -Make a wish. -All right. First, I wish myself to be happy every day. -And then-- -Aren't you happy now? I'm happy that both of you are here. Sorry. Your hair is long. I need to give you a haircut. The second wish? I wish to save enough money to buy my own house. How about the third wish? My third wish is a secret. I wish… Can we just leave it? Do you want to kiss Hsin-hsin? Do you want a kiss? Kiss him! Hsin-hsin. You can't sleep? Get some sleep. Come find me at Spring Square tomorrow. -I'll be working there all day. -Really? I'm really happy that you're here. Get some sleep. Hsin-hsin. Come here, children. I want one too. -Balloons! -Everyone gets it. I want to take a photo with the clown! This is for you. Central Bank was robbed earlier today. -Police failed to stop them -We're here. -and the suspects fled. -Idiot! Ever seen a mall before? There's Hsin-hsin! Where? Which one? The one in white. -What happened? -Call the police! There are gangsters! Run! Quick! Run! Run quickly! Run! Hurry up! Don't move! -Don't come near! -Quick! You like brave guys? Every girl likes brave guys. FOR THE BRAVEST MEN ONLY THE TOUGHEST ARENA I'm not going back. -Aren't we going to the police academy? -Being a policeman suits you. But not me. THE TOUGHEST ARENA I hope that the next time I see you, I can say, "Hi, Mr. Policeman." So, the next time I see you, you'll be a fighter? Excuse me, I would like to sign up. Can I sign up here? Hey, you! I want to fight. Do I sign up here? -You want to fight? -Yes. I've wanted to fight since I was a kid. Where did you train? -Show me. -Sure. Let me tell you, I grew up-- Let's have a fight! -Stop it! -Hey! -Why isn't your mom here with you? -Who do you want to fight with, boy? -What are you doing? Go home. -Hey. -Let him in. -Go home. -Watch him. -Don't bully him. -There he goes. -What a posture! Look at his posture. -What is he doing? -He's dumb. You don't belong here, punk. Hey! Open up! I have your magazine. You don't want it? Hey! I know you are Flash. Teach me how to throw thunder. If you won't, I'll kneel here. I'm going to kneel now, for real! I know, you tried to protect everyone, that's why you became the Flash. Can you teach me? The truth is my parents didn't die in that explosion. I was abandoned. Like you, I am unwanted. I'm the real orphan in that orphanage. My parents didn't want me. I've got nothing. All I want is to be stronger. If my crush is in danger, I won't even know what to do. Maybe… if I become stronger, I can do more. When that time comes, I will know why I was born into this world. I need to tell you, you can't just get superpowers. What are your strengths? -I was beaten up a lot. -Good. Let's practice that. -Does that hurt? -Yes. -Does that hurt? -Of course! -Does that hurt? -No, it doesn't. That's right. To not feel pain, we need to intercept section B of your brain's nervous system, -so you won't feel pain. -So, where is section B? It's next to section A. It's between section A and C. As for superpowers, my mom got struck by lightning during her pregnancy. I was born with thunder-controlling abilities. I had no choice but to accept it and see what I can do with it. Come eat something. Take it easy, man. -Your hands. -What? Use your hands! Eat up! In conclusion, it's a combination of fate and coincidence that I got these powers. Everything is meant to be. I'm not afraid of pain at all. -Does that hurt? -No! Good. You will never get any powers. You should just focus on surviving in the ring. Put it down. Do you mind if I touch it? -Does that hurt? -No. Ready? Master. What do you want? I'll help you. Good. Fish balls, beef, dumplings, tofu, chicken, and maybe some vegetables. I'm done. How do I eat this? Did you wash your hands? You can now tolerate extreme pain, except for… one spot. At least he runs fast. Let's go. -Who's that? -The same guy. Where's the scum who beat me last time? Why? Are you scared? Is he hiding? Stop. It's you again? What are you here for? I'm here to fight. You? Come here, Ashu. Tonight's fighter couldn't make it. His opponent is the Rookie of the Year. Do you want to fight him? My leg hasn't healed yet. Anyone else? Who wants to fight? Me. I'll fight. You? Your opponent, Thundertooth is a heavyweight. He killed two fighters in six months. Everyone is scared. Are you scared? I'm scared of you not letting me fight. This is a death waiver. If any part of your body is broken or injured, medical bills, therapy fees, funeral expenses are your responsibility. Win or lose, you get paid. -I take 70% commission. -70%? What? Are you in or out? I'm in. Dear viewers, Dorique is absent due to injury. So now we have a new guy that we've never heard of -as his substitute fighter, Yi-chih. -Yi-chih! This newbie still has a lot to learn. -Yi-chih is now getting up from the floor. -You can do this! It's almost Round 4. I want to see how long he can last. Save your energy, keep your head low. Don't throw empty punches. Keep your feet moving. Back away from his attacks. I won't back away. Why? Have you ever fought before? I usually get beaten up. That's a skill too. Make it to Round 9 and I'll let you in the next match. Really? Remember, Round 9. So far Thundertooth is performing well. -His opponent can't fight back-- -Why didn't I win? -Watch out! -A kick! Dear viewers, this is not a foul! The fight always starts after the bell. Mr. Ma, I think we should reevaluate this guy. Exactly. -This could kill him. -Right. He doesn't even understand the rules. I don't think he's going to last. Such a beautiful shot by the photographers! Wang Yi-chih is falling down. -He's still standing! -Thundertooth is stained with his blood. Okay, we're in Round 7 now. We can say that he's amazing. And he seems worn out. We're in Round 8 now. Thundertooth must be shocked that he lasted until now. So it seems like he's done wasting time. He's attacking nonstop. Okay, we're in Round 9 now. How did he manage to last this long? Take this! Thundertooth used his signature move! -He should've done this long ago. -Yes, it's already time for dinner! Two! Three! Six! Seven! Eight! Nine! He is standing up again! He's defeated. He's moving again! Dear viewers, we thought Thundertooth would knock him out, -but apparently not. -Yi-chih! -We thought it was an easy match. -Thundertooth won! -But what a surprising turn! -Thundertooth just puked. I've never seen anyone win this ugly. Yi-chih lost the fight, -but won our hearts. -Wang Yi-chih. I'll remember this name now. It was a good fight. Hey, when will my next match be? Let's talk when you've recovered. Hey, ugly face. Sissy. What's up? Are you okay? "Police." Where's the gun? I've never seen a real one. -I haven't graduated, so no gun. -No gun? What have you been doing then? -I took a photo of you. Check it out. -You took a photo? -Yes. Look. -Did you get it? So handsome! Hsin-hsin invited us to dinner tomorrow. You're in no shape to see her. Real men should have scars. Yikes! I will pay for dinner. -Take care of Hsin-hsin. -Why don't you let me pay? You look poor. Don't try to be a hero, okay? It's fine. It has only been a while, but why do both of you look taller? What happened to you? He was beaten up. -What? -I'm a fighter now. -A fighter? -Who is he? Allow me to introduce him to both of you. His name is Yu-hsuan. He is my boyfriend. He works with computers. My computer was broken and he fixed it. They're the ones I told you about, Chien-han and Yi-chih. They've followed me around since we were kids. Hello. Hey. Have a seat. She talks about both of you a lot. -She says-- -My name is Chien-han. I'm a student at the police academy. I'll have my own gun once I graduate. If anyone mistreats Hsin-hsin, I'll blow his head off. My name is Yi-chih. I'm a fighter. If anyone mistreats Hsin-hsin, I will punch him in the face right now. My name is Liang Yu-hsuan. My dad taught me about computers. My dad passed away. I didn't know my dad. My mom also passed away. I didn't know my mom either. Are you guys done? Nobody has a chat like this. We're having a good chat. A very good chat. Yes, a very good chat. Very good. I'm going to the restroom. -I'll come with you. -It's okay. How long have you been together? Not too long. How long is not too long? What base are you at? You're too young to ask that. Young? We're grown-ups. So grown-up. How are you guys? Yu-hsuan takes a bit of time to get along. Hsin-hsin, I thought you like brave guys? I do. What's wrong? Are you sick? I got it from you. -I'm sorry. -It's fine. Are you Sonic? Sonic, your costume is ugly. What is Sonic really like? -Does he look just as stupid? -Yes. Just like you. You're both idiots, but cute. So Sonic… He has superpowers unlike me. Do it again! What? I bought you this with my prize money even though I didn't win. Thank you. Did you wear underwear inside your superhero costume? -Next time, we… -Okay. I thought you hated superheroes. I never said that. I'm just not a fan of Flash. Besides, even if Yu-hsuan isn't Sonic, I'll still like him. You'll understand this when you meet your true love. Please don't assume who my true love is. Sorry. Where do you guys hang out? Superheroes must be busy. That's right. He often just disappears in the middle of dinner. I mean, after all, he's got the world to save. Yi-chih. Can you truly be happy for me? I want superpowers. I want superpowers! I want to learn superpowers! I must learn superpowers! -I want to be better than Sonic! -Impossible. -I will protect world peace. -Peace. -Keep the universe balanced. -Balanced. Why don't you practice holding your shit? What about you? -Why do you have superpowers? -I'm born this way. -What about Cube? -An accident. -Then why can't I be an accident? -You can. Maybe after you run into a car and don't die. The remaining half of the Matrix research just had a major breakthrough. Not only was the mystery solved, but they also discovered the insides of the Matrix. What exactly is in the Hyper Matrix? -We will show you right now. -Chairman, please answer me. Can you share some insights of this research? We knew the Matrix contains massive energy. Since we decoded its molecular arrangement, it could be an important energy source. Perhaps it can solve the nuclear energy crisis. We are still studying it. Since it's very unstable now, we will do our best to protect it. Are there any potential risks with the Matrix? Okay. Thank you, everyone! If you are doing this, we… Why are you still here? Go get hit by a car. THE MATRIX MYSTERY SOLVED? Are you an idiot? This is so embarrassing. Where did you get that spider from? Come on. Hit me. Come hit me. Do it! Are you done? Please stop calling me. It's hard to park the car here. Thank you. Sonic. It's such a big world, yet you're the only superhero. You're way too busy. I think I'm too busy as well, with all these fires and robberies. Maybe you should share half your powers with someone who can also save the world. I've never thought of it before. Me. I can do it. Let me tell you, I'll use my powers on-- But I don't know how to share my powers. So selfish. Those nurses are hot. Yes, they are. Then why do you have to be with Hsin-hsin? You can get anyone you want. I believe they are out of my league. I'll just get dumped. But you're Sonic. I like kind girls. Here she comes. She's super caring and kind-hearted. Most importantly, she's not hot at all. She's kind, but I like skinnier girls. -This one is skinny and kind. -Is it tasty? She must be your type. Isn't she a bit too young? You idiot. No one likes older girls. But… I like girls with longer hair. Long hair, skinny, and looks kind from the back. But she must be super ugly once she turns around. Long hair, skinny… But how do you know she is kind? Anyway, she must be super ugly once she turns around. Thank you, doctor. What were both of you talking about? -We were just-- -Nothing. What are we doing later? -What about watching a movie? -Really? Amazing. It's your first poster. -Were you cold? -Go away, idiot! Hey, there! Why are you here? Thank you! -What are you laughing at? -Check this out. Ta-da! My opponent, Miyamoto. Rumor says his left jab is super fast and his right jab is explosive. Isn't that dangerous then? Do you want to watch me fight? If you come, I would be happy. If he doesn't have to save the world, he can come too. No. I don't want to see you get beaten up. All right! Don't be late! -Don't miss out on the show! -Hey! Do you have plans tonight? No. I'll be graduating soon. I'm applying for an internship at the orphanage. -The orphanage? -Yes. We finally got out of there. You're going back? I know the condition is bad there, so I want to help. How about you? Are you going to keep fighting? Is that your dream? Or… Is doing stupid things every day and trying to be a superhero your dream? Actually, I know why do you fight. I am now at Nanguang and Heping intersection, where Sonic and Cube had just fought earlier. From the videos taken by netizens, we can see that Cube got stronger. Sonic was seriously injured for the first time. He is still under observation. We will keep you updated with the latest news. Sorry! -Sonic will only see her. -Hey! You should go back. Get some rest. OPERATION IN PROGRESS Sonic has no weakness in his powers, but his personal life is different. Ladies and gentlemen. The Superhero Wrestling Competition officially starts. The match hasn't started, -but the crowd has gone wild. -Miyamoto! -Everyone is here for him. -Right. Everyone wants to see how will Miyamoto face this strong-resistant newbie, -Wang Yi-chih. -Wang Yi-chih. He is quick today, getting right back up. Isn't that exactly what we want to see? Golden Eagle keeps attacking Yi-chih nonstop. -Right on his belly! -He's knocked down again! He is insulting Golden Eagle! -Golden Eagle slams him to the ground. -This is wow! Dear viewers, this is the legendary scissor legs! Left Jab King attacks hard. Yi-chih is crawling on the floor now. -It's going to be a strange match today. -A really strange match. The Punch Man is famous for his fast attacks, but his opponent today, Wang Yi-chih, is extremely tough. I bet Yi-chih can last until Round 9. Another nonstop attack. Golden Eagle has knocked Yi-chih down. Miyamoto is punching him like a sandbag. Yi-chih is knocked down again. He's up in the air! Do you know who we're fighting today? -Stonewall. -Yi-chih. Even I feel powerful when I hear his name. -He's getting back up! -Look. -He never gives up. -This is amazing. He is kicked out of the ring. -Golden Eagle roars out of victory. -Stonewall! Do you hear the crowd? They are cheering for Stonewall. -Stonewall! -Stonewall! -Stonewall! -It's a very strange scene. Stonewall gets beaten up every time he fights, but the crowd just loves him! Stonewall! STONEWALL IS THE BEST -Looks like the Jab King can jab no more. -He's exhausted. Time is running out. Stonewall keeps getting back up, no one can defeat him. It's remarkable! Miyamoto won. -Why is everyone booing? -Everyone is booing! -What is happening? -Stonewall! -Stonewall! -Stonewall! -Stonewall! -This is unbelievable! Everyone is calling his name! He got his ass kicked for the whole match, but the crowd loves him. Look at him. It's really amazing! THE BIRTH OF STONEWALL I doubt Yi-chih feels any pain. He didn't feel pain! He must be on drugs! -Stonewall is so handsome. -Exactly! I've never seen anyone like him. It's nothing. He's crazy. They'd better fucking check on him. THE LEGEND OF STONEWALL Yi-chih, how do you feel about the name "Stonewall"? Good! Aren't you worried of death? I'm terrified. What makes you keep getting back up? What is your training secret? What is your usual training routine? -Can I come in? -Sure. Hurry. -Wow, it's too big. -Here. Someday, I'll be standing on this stage. Fifty-thousand people will watch me fight. And you will be sitting in the VIP seat right there. When your opponent gets stronger, won't you get beaten up harder? No. It couldn't get any worse. I'm Stonewall now. So no matter how bad it gets, I'll get up again. I know, you worry that I'll get hurt and get my head injured. But you know what? You're putting yourself out there, trying to understand my world. It makes me very happy. I feel like you've accepted all my faults and silliness. Regarding my stubborn love for you, I feel like you've also accepted it all. Quick. Faster. Good, faster. Again. Do you remember how many fights you've fought? -About 16 fights. -So 16 fights? Sixteen losses. Zero wins. The Champ fought 60 matches and all were knockouts. His punches are deadly, weighing 280kg per punch. His opponents never made it to Round 3. 31 of them are forever paralyzed. Why are you telling me this? What do you think about all this? I'm just wondering. If this guy is so good, how long could I last? There's only one way to find out. THE CHAMP, YUJIRO VS STONEWALL, WANG YI-CHIH Am I fighting him? But I've never won before. Relax, no one expects you to win. Everyone is just curious. You always last until the end and have never been KO-d before. Will The Champ knock out Stonewall? Everybody is talking about you. The Champ is great, but he'll eventually get tired, and run out of breath. It's not impossible to last until Round 9. All it takes is someone who isn't afraid to die. -Impossible. -Why? It's impossible. Have you tried eating with your butt? -No. -That's right. But he'll run out of breath after three rounds. Just outlast him. -How tall is The Champ? -185cm. -How big is he? -Pretty big. -Long or short hair? -Short. -Is he gay? -How would I know? -Does he have a girlfriend? -I don't know! Can you stop asking questions? Fine. I'll teach you one punch. The most powerful punch. The Champ is about this tall, his nose should be here. -The Champ, can you defeat Stonewall? -I'm not interested in beating this clown. I'm just here by request. I see a positive attitude from Stonewall. I like Stonewall. Kids could learn something from him. -Never give up. -Keep getting back up. I drew Stonewall in class. He's my favorite. The crowd wants to see him in Round 9. What do you think? If he wants to stay alive, he should stay down. -You can do it, Stonewall. -You can do it, Stonewall. Draw your heroes properly. Don't miss out on the details. STONEWALL What are you doing here? What's up? Why are you so mean? Why are you dressed up like this? Aren't you… -busy today? -Not really. I have something more important to do. What is it? Do you know what I felt the last time I fought with Cube? Fear. I've never felt fear. But I was terrified that day. I was so scared that if I died, I won't see you again. I want to be with you forever, protect, and take care of you. Hsin-hsin. Will you marry me? I'm not sure if I'm ready. What's holding you back? I can help you. So this is Sonic's weakness. Great. She can be my bargaining chip for the Matrix. Fight! -You're fighting The Champ. You're tough! -What's wrong? Aren't you good at dodging punches? Keep dodging it then. What the hell is wrong with you? I don't understand you. If you want to fight, then fight. But why with The Champ? -Why not him? -Are you insane? He has paralyzed so many people. Why do you want to be next? I want to let The Champ know that he's only The Champ because he has never fought me. Who are you to fight The Champ? Don't you know they just want you to lose? I might have never won, but I've never really lost. You're just a clown. A clown. I'm nobody's clown! They love me. They call me Stonewall. You think you're so capable. The truth is only you are stupid enough to fight. Just standing there, getting beat up! If you're not a clown, what are you? I'm not a clown! You are, in the ring! You are, in front of The Champ! That's why I'm practicing. The Champ is good, but I don't plan to lose. With this punch, it will knock him out. Fine. Stop fighting! Fine. I know you think that it's an honor to fight The Champ. But I'm begging you. After Round 1, just don't get up. Okay? Why do you think I will lose? He's so strong, you're so weak! That's why I'm trying to train! Right! I'm not as good as your boyfriend! He's busy saving the world. What about me? I'm just the loser in the ring. I've never even won a single match. That's how weak I am! I'm so weak! I can never compare myself to him, but I like you! What can I do? Even if you beat The Champ, I'll never be with you. You should know that Yu-hsuan and I are getting married soon. I'm not asking for your pity! I'm not asking you to be with me! I'm not asking for anything! Not a single thing! THE CHAMP VS STONEWALL -Stonewall! -Stonewall! -Stonewall! -Stonewall! Welcome to the 14th World Boxing Competition! In the red corner, with 0 wins and 16 losses, -Stonewall! -Stonewall! Stonewall, you're charming! Stonewall, please don't fall down! -I'm supporting you, Stonewall! -You can do it! -Stonewall! -Stonewall! -In the blue corner, -Stonewall! with a perfect record of 66 wins! The toughest and invincible world champion, -Yujiro! -The Champ! -The Champ! -The Champ! -Stonewall! -The Champ! -The Champ! -The Champ! -The Champ! -Stonewall! Stare back! Don't avoid eye contact! Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the 14th World Boxing Competition. -Go Stonewall! -This is a fight between sword and shield, the fight that everyone has been waiting for. Just one punch. I can do this. Let's win ourselves a champion's belt. The bell rings. The fight is about to start! The fighters have entered. Begin! One kick and Stonewall is down! -He's The Champ for a reason! -This is scary. But it takes more than a kick to defeat Stonewall. He'll definitely stand up again. But he is a little wobbly. -Looks like The Champ kicked pretty hard. -Really hard. Another round of attacks. The Champ is really giving it to him. -He's cornered! -It's dangerous, very dangerous. -Why are you still standing? Get down! -The Champ keeps attacking. Stonewall fights back and The Champ swing kicks back. KEEP IT UP, STONEWALL! One! Two! I won't give you Hsin-hsin. -Get up! You can do this! -Get up! You can do this! Five! Stonewall is down. It's only Round 1 and the referee is counting down. -Wait. He's standing up slowly. -Seven! Stonewall is standing up now! -Stonewall! -Stonewall! He's standing up now. The crowd cheers for him! -He is on his feet again. -It's unbelievable! It's not easy to stand up after all those punches! Time's up. All right, I think the bell saved Stonewall. Oh no! He's down again! -Stonewall, you can do it! -It's only Round 3. Stonewall has been knocked down seven times. But if he can make it through Round 3, he will make history. The Champ keeps attacking. Stonewall is cornered. The Champ kicks. One punch. Another punch. It's a mismatch now. This is no longer a fair fight. Upperhook! Stonewall is fighting back! -He almost hit him. -Almost! What happened to The Champ? He's standing still. One! -He's down. The Champ is down! -Two. -He knocked out The Champ! -Three. -I don't believe my eyes. -Four. -This is insane! -Five. With 66 consecutive knockouts, -The Champ is finally down! -The Champ fell! Fight. This is a miracle! This round has surprised everyone! -A miracle, a historical moment! -Stonewall! -Stonewall is taking The Champ to Round 4. -You can do it! He just knocked out The Champ to the ground. Will we be witnessing his first win? This is brilliant! -Go, Stonewall! -Go, Stonewall! What just happened? He practiced this move to get me. I see it. It won't happen again. The next round will be a new match for The Champ. -It's my match now. -That's right. Show him. Who's-- -Stonewall! -Stonewall! It's now Round 9. Believe it or not, Stonewall hasn't been knocked down for five rounds. -Our Stonewall is stable with his feet. -Stonewall! Yes, there seems to be a huge gap between their stamina. Stonewall doesn't care about The Champ's attacks. Is this it? Do we have a new champion? Citizens, I now hold the entire orphanage in hostage. Allow me to introduce to you someone special, Sonic's girlfriend. I have invited Sonic to the Spring Square to take off his mask and wait. Your stupid TV should be reporting this. If Sonic moves away from the camera or from any media's eyes, I'll kill this girl and all the orphans. Now, I want the Matrix from your stupid labs. You have one hour to bring it to me. Sonic, don't let your fiancée die. Give him the Matrix. I swear I'll rip him into pieces. Give him the Matrix! I swear I'll rip him into pieces! While Sonic faces this… -Hey! -Hey! I'm going for something more important than the champion's belt. Let's go. What are you waiting for? Cube must have locked the orphanage. There's one secret route. We need to find one more person. I know. Master. Hsin-hsin and the orphanage are in trouble. All the kids could die. Come with us to save them. Hurry! You can give up on the fight. But I don't want you to give up on your life. I have to save her, please. Only you can help me. Please, Master. Please, Master. Please. Only you can save her. I have to save her. -I am begging you, Master. -Get up. -Master. -Get up. -Go away. -Are you still dreaming? Please. Why are you asking this loser? He's a pussy. Master. -Even if we can't save Hsin-hsin, -Save her, -at least we'll be together. -Master! Please, Master. You have to save her. Please. Do you know why I have these gloves on? I don't want to get involved anymore. I know now. You are no longer Flash. Today is going to be an unforgettable day. I'm sure he will come. Who? Who said you could touch her? Be good. Sonic will be pissed. Don't be afraid. Close your eyes. Pretend it's hide and seek. Count to 100. Sonic will find us. Hey. Have you shot a gun before? The first shot will be for Hsin-hsin. Can I even count on you? Give it to me. Go! Where are the others? This is fake. You brought me a fake one. Be careful. Walk through the tunnel and you'll be safe. Be careful. Stay safe. Hey. -Do you have a plan to kill Cube? -Hell no. Let's get Hsin-hsin and run. Fine, deal. Attention, citizens. I am a man with principles. But you've tricked me with your cunning tricks! Remember, your scientists killed these kids. And Sonic, I'm really sorry for you. Your city has betrayed you. Prepare for your girlfriend to die. You can't blame me. You should blame this world! Yi-chih! -No! -Go! Go! Here I come. Old man. You're still alive? Actually, I have only 10% of strength. Flash is long gone. But I'll always be your master. Why am I… here? My dad left me. My mom left me. Even Hsin-hsin doesn't want me. No one wants me. Why was I even born? Why am I here, fighting a monster? Go die! I am sorry. I am too weak. I am way too weak. Hsin-hsin, you must be laughing at me. I'm this weak. How dare I fight this monster? With that explosion, Flash accidentally turned Cube into a monster. That explosion, also brought us together. If we weren't bullied, we wouldn't have found the tunnel. We wouldn't have met the legendary Flash. If Hsin-hsin hadn't fallen in love with Sonic, I wouldn't have learned to fight. If Chien-han didn't go to the police academy and had a gun, we wouldn't have made it here. If Flash hadn't come, there would've been only Cube here. I swore that I would never come back. But now, I'm here. Right. This is all because I fell in love with Hsin-hsin. If it weren't for her, I wouldn't have fought. If it weren't for her, -I wouldn't have learned that punch. -I'll teach you one punch. She's too good for me. You like brave guys? But… if being a superhero is fate, I know, I can be her hero. Goodbye. Goodbye, Hsin-hsin. I really, really love her. For her, I will be the bravest. Cube, so you are just as tall as The Champ. I know. This punch was never meant for The Champ. This punch is the reason I was born. I love you. That is my superpower. Yi-chih. Yi-chih. Yi-chih. Look at you. Your hair has grown longer. Am I… the bravest guy in the universe yet? Will you marry me? Yes. That summer, I fell in love with the most beautiful girl. When she smiles at me, it's as if I were in heaven. I'll be gone. But I won't be far away. FIGHT FOR WHAT YOU LOVE. THANK YOU FOR ALWAYS BEING HERE. Subtitle translation by: Jude Wang
