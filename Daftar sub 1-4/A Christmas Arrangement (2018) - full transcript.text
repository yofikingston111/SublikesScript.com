Rip-Fixes-Sync by VaVooM I know I'm new in town, but Poppy's Petals has been a staple in Santa Mesa for nearly two decades. I know I'm not Gladys, but she was my grandma, and she did name the shop after me. Everything I know, I learned from her. Well, I just know that my flowers will make your tea party perfectly pristine. Well, I was thinking something elegant and monochromatic. Maybe some white poinsettias and some, silver-painted lemon leaves. And if you wanna add a little character, we could get some anti-crystal vases. Okay. Okay, well, I really hope I hear from you. Thank you, Mrs. Darington. You okay? Yeah. Thank you. I'm-I'm just bit of a klutz. Well, at least your phone's in a protective case. Yeah. Thank you. Those, pine sprigs are great, but they'll break on you if you're not careful with them. Well, I'm-I'm just not very good at multitasking. I had to go on foot today. Sounds like you need a delivery van. - I'm, I'm Garrett. - I'm Poppy. Yeah, I actually have one. She's just a little cranky today, that's all. Well, maybe, Santa can get you a new van for Christmas. My Edna is irreplaceable. But I do have a long list of things I need from Santa. You have a van named Edna? If you saw her, you would understand. Okay. Well, if Edna has to stay then what else is on the top of your, Christmas wish list? Well, besides getting somewhere on time for once... No, no, no, no. That's time management. I was asking about a wish. Okay, well, I really like churros. Now we're talking. I just happen to know a place on the East side that has the best churros in all of Santa Mesa. Okay, well, I'll have to check it out sometime. Can I give you a hint? I'm down that way, but, I'm happy to help out for a few minutes in the spirit of the giving season. You're... Thank you. I'm okay. I'll survive, even if the sprigs don't. - Thank you, though. - All right. Well, good luck with the multitasking, Poppy. It was nice meeting you. You, too... - Garrett. - Garrett. - Merry Christmas. - You, too. So, how did the call go? Did we get it? She's considering her options. We're an untried entity. Look, I know that Santa Mesa can be a little snooty, but I promise you, you just get one of these Country Club tea party ladies in your pocket and we are set and pretty. - I'm trying. - You'll get it. - I hope so. - You kinda have to. We just got the electric bill. And we really gotta update this flower cooler. It is sucking down kilowatts like there's no tomorrow. Okay. Well, my grandma opened this shop with that cooler. Which is precisely why it's long overdue for its retirement. I feel like all we do is pay bills. Or not pay bills. I just wanna make pretty things and make people happy. And that is a noble and highly under-appreciated calling. Listen, all of this is gonna blossom real soon. - I promise you. - I hope so. I really don't wanna let my grandma down. - Good morning, ladies. - Morning. Looks lovely. Okay, I am off to the nursing home. Poppy, you can't be doing that anymore. But it makes the residents so happy to see pretty flowers, and, Natalie, it's three weeks till Christmas. They deserve some holiday cheer. And we need some paying customers. You can't give all the flowers away. My mother always said you have to give the world what you want it to give back to you. So you want the world to give you free flowers for life? No. I wanna be happy, so I give away happy. That's what Christmas is about, right? I wish someone would pay you to come up with inspirational posters. Ooh, side hustle. Let's think about it. Come on! Come on. I know it's early, Edna, but, please, come on. I'm on my way. Where you at? The front of the shop. Okay, don't go anywhere. Very cute. Edna... - Poppy, I hate to say it... - Then don't. - This is just a Band-Aid. - Well, that's not bad news. I mean, Band-Aids are like a medical marvel, right? Poppy, this old gal's on her last leg. Yeah, well, she's gonna have to get a crutch because this old girl is cash-poor. Well, this'll last you a couple of weeks, at most. Where's your faith, Joe? The faith in me is charming, but I'm a mechanic, not Santa Claus. Pops, I love Edna, too... but I think it's time to let her go. Okay. I'm going back in. Hey, do you want me to order you something for lunch? Hey, I might go out today. You don't know. So, "Turkey club, hold the cheese, add avocado?" Yeah, you know what? Let's add bacon today. I'm feeling adventurous. Okay. ! Marie. These... are for you. Merry Christmas to the best assistant ever. Second row to The Nutcracker? Thank you. How did you... I heard you talking to Justine about how your boyfriend wouldn't spring for tickets. I want you to enjoy the show. Thank you so much. - Thank you. - Merry Christmas. Mrs. Darington called while you were out on delivery. Okay, this is the part where you smile and clap your hands and throw confetti and say, "We got the gig". I... could do the first three things if you want. She said they're going with Covington Designs. Gosh. You know what I would really like for Christmas? To never hear the word "Covington Designs" again. Good luck with that. Why doesn't anyone want anything fresh and new in this town? Do you want the truth or should I just wait, see where this goes? Every time I lose a gig, it's because it goes to Covington Designs. Well, at least she let us know. I mean, she could have kept us waiting, hoping, right? I prefer hoping, because it's... you know, hopeful. Hey, it is dogwood eats dogwood in the cut-throat world of flower arranging. But there's no time for tears because you have another delivery. Twelve dozen long-stem roses. Classic, romantic and profitable. - In the name of romance. - And profits. We carry on. No, Edna, please. No. Edna, please. Not today. Just one more delivery. Come on. Okay. Hey, this is Joe. Leave a message. Hey, Joe, it's Poppy. I'm on the corner of... First and Hannover. The old girl is having another flare up. Could you come quick? Thank you. Oh, Edna. Is this a sign? Am I just supposed to give up? "Five thousand dollars?" This is a sign. Yes? What did you wanna talk about? Blair, we have been working together for 12 years now. Oh, darling, did I forget out anniversary? Forgive me, I've just been flooded with these designs for the governor's Christmas ball. Now, I have been with you since you started Covington Designs and along the way I've gotten a few offers here and there. Some enticing. But I've always believed in your vision. Too much sentimentality. And all before noon. Now, part of what has kept me here is the promise that one day I might see my name above that door, too. Yes. As we reflect on the past, we also dream about the future. Well, that time is now, Blair. Time for what? Time for you to make me a partner. And you said this would happen last year after the holidays. And, yet, here we are again, and nothing's changed. What gives? Garrett, you know my intentions are good, but you can't just come in here and waylay me in the middle of a design session. I tried to talk to you about it all the time throughout the year, but there's always some excuse. You're too busy. It's not an excuse. It's true. Listen, if you can't give me a clear timeline for partnership then I have to consider other options. Don't pout. We'll come up with an agreement. I'm serious, Blair. Listen, I appreciate everything you've done. You know that. But I won't stay in for less than what I deserve. That's why I'll give you until tomorrow to decide. And if not? You'll have to accept my resignation. I think I found a solution to our problem. Ooh, did Santa sent us a sleigh with eight million tiny dollars? I am gonna win at the Santa Mesa Holiday Floral Show. First prize is $5,000. Can you imagine the press? Poppy, I hate to burst your bubble, but there is only one winner of the Santa Mesa Holiday Floral Show, and that is Blair Covington. I thought we said that we're never gonna say that name again. She's taken top prize for 12 years running. Nobody can beat her. Nobody, except a young, upstart, new, and ready to take on the flower world by storm. Do you have any idea what you're in for? Sit. Okay, so if you were selected as one of the ten top entries, the next three weeks of your life are going to be consumed by a holiday flower explosion. Three insanely intense rounds of competition with the grand finale unfolding at the convention center. - On Christmas Eve's eve. - What? The day before, the day before Christmas. Fine. I'm in. Where do I send my look book? I am loving this can-do attitude. I'm gonna go spruce up your entry letter. I'm gonna win this flower show. Wait, did you start without me? Just the lights. I saved the ornaments for you. Is that my pipe cleaner Santa? You know, I remember when you brought that home from school. You were so proud of it. And your mom's best guess was it was a reindeer. And I burst into tears and threw it in the trash. Yeah, but she found it, she put it right in the middle of the tree, where everyone could see it. - Every single year. - Yeah. You know, your mom always said that you inherited your grandmother's creative genius. Yeah, well, I hope that's the truth if I'm gonna win the Santa Mesa Holiday Floral Show. You're entering? Oh, honey, that's wonderful. Congratulations. Yeah. You know, your mom would be so proud of you taking over the family shop and... Well, I don't know what I would have done if you weren't around to help me. Well, first of all, you'd starve. What? Dad, I can cook. Not buttered, toasted PB and J's. Oof! That doesn't count. Who doesn't like peanut butter and jelly? Your palate is just underdeveloped. Oh, really? Well, we'll see what you have to say after you've had two bowls of my absolutely, amazingly delicious chili. All right. Wait, wait, wait, one sec. Okay. Okay. Now it's really Christmas. Yeah. Now, if we could just get some snow. Did we? You got in. I'm so excited. Okay, but seriously, we have so much work to do. - Are you ready? - I was born ready. Yes! Well, I'd like to say congrats to us for getting intothliy Fw again this year. But I mean, was it ever really a question? Nope. These are nice. Let's switch out the, paperwhites for some amborellas. It's just more grand. Are these for an event? No, it's for the show. I design the Holiday Floral Show. This is your opportunity to let me step forward. Come on, your name will still be on the booth. Yeah, that's the problem. It's my name and my reputation that's at stake here. Maybe next year when you've had more time to prepare. These designs are great and you know it, Blair. I don't know what your hurry is. I mean, Garrett, it's not like you aren't deeply embedded in this company with a very generous salary. Okay, Blair... I wanna make a deal with you. I don't make deals. I make decisions. Let me design the entrees into the floral show this year. Okay? Just give me control, and if I win... you make me partner. You put my name above the door. And if I lose... I'll sign a contract to work with you for five years in any capacity you see fit. And if I say no? I walk. I'd be starting from scratch, but you and I both know I'd have no problem making a name for myself in this town. Well, your confidence is inspiring. Don't disappoint me. Yes! Hello? Dad, what're you doing here? Well, I was just driving on my way home and, I saw the lights were still on and... - You're here late. - Yeah. Yeah. Well, I just want everything to be perfect for the show, so I'm trying to get ahead of the game. Well, I brought you some edible assistance. Little hot cocoa... and Christmas cookies. Thank you, dad. - May I see? - Yeah. So the theme for the first round is Christmas is fun the happy. I'm doing an Edwardian fireplace with hung stockings. - What do you think? - Well, I think it's perfect. I was hoping for a bit more constructive criticism, dad. Well, I'm afraid you've come to the wrong guy, because I happen to think that everything you do is just genius. Dad, I need to win this show. I don't know how much longer I can keep this place afloat. Well, you know I'll do anything to help. It's just all these bills keep piling up while everything else is breaking down. Poppy, let me give you some money. No, dad, I wanna do this on my own. Well, then we'll make it a loan. Dad, I'm not letting you dip into your retirement fund. You've already done enough. Poppy, it's what parents do. Look, I take care of you, and then someday when I'm really old, hopefully, you won't put me in any of those tacky Christmas sweater vests. Okay. Tsk. Thank you, dad. I love you. You're gonna come out on top because you always do. I hope so. This store depends on it. My phone. I'm so... Excuse me. Sorry about that. Hey, it's you again. You should really hire an intern to help you with your multitasking. I feel like I'm in one of those hidden camera shows and eventually I'm gonna find out. I just have brilliant comedic timing. Ooh, I'm-I'm sorry, I'm running late. No. No problem. Me, too. I'm surprised to see you here. What, with my undying love for pine sprigs. Is it really that implausible? No, I'm just usually not that lucky. Listen, I'd offer to help you carry this, but I got a feeling I already know the answer. Yeah. One day, I'll learn. I hope I'm there when you do. I forgot my phone, so I'm going back that way. Okay. All right, I'll see you around. - Okay. - Poppy. Why does he have to be so handsome? That's Poppy, from Poppy's Petals. - I think I met a guy. - Ooh, do tell. I've run into him twice now... Wait, dad, just... Left hangin' in suspense much? Poppy, tell me more. That is an impressive costume. Well, at Covington Designs we like to take every opportunity to further the assigned theme. You work at Covington Designs. I heard they're pretty big winners. But you better tell that Blair Covington there is a new sheriff in flower town. What have you heard about Blair Covington? What haven't I heard? By the way, is she here yet? I would love you to point her out. Just to size up my competition. I am Blair Covington. Hi. And if you want my advice, I'd, thin out the pepper berries. Thank you so much. So that went well. Get me the pepper berries. Right. What do you think? Tsk... Well... I suppose... we'll have to let the judges decide. I take that as a vote of confidence. Good afternoon, judges. Miss Cromwell-Eastland. Welcome to our Edwardian Christmas party. Hello. I am certain you will find everything here up to the exacting standards of what you'd expect from the Fountains Abbey Estate. Lovely. Poppy's Petals. I have passed your store before. It is so cute. Thank you. Catchy name, too. - Phil and Audrey Wilson. - Hi! - Roses Are Red Florals. - Hi. - Bart. - Nice to meet you. - Natalie. - Hi. Pleasure. Team's lookin' a little thin, don't you think? You know what? Best of luck to you guys. We'll see you. She's the mayor's daughter. Can you get me my phone? Yeah. - Hey, Poppy. - Joe? - She break down again? - No, no, no. Edna's fine. But I need you. Could you come down here? - On my way. - Thank you. Bye. Guys. Guys. Hi, Poppy's Petals. Enchanting. Total engine rebuild. Rush job. Got here as quick as I could. Thank you so much, Joe, apparently, our team was looking a little thinner than the everyone else's. Not a problem. I got nothing better going on now. It's always a good time to stop and smell the roses. Right? And, yet, he shows up covered in grease. Thanks. Always a pleasure, Nat. Welcome to the Santa Mesa Holiday Floral Show preliminary competition. I am Dorothy Cromwell-Eastland. And as many of you know, I am the chairwoman of the Santa Mesa Floral Beautification Committee. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. You are far too kind. And now, without further ado, it is time to announce today's top five designers who will advance to the semi-finals in one week. And our first semi-finalist, Poppy Benson of Poppy's Petals. Congratulations. Our second designer, Garrett Hurley of Covington Designs. Next up, Phil and Audrey Wilson of Roses Are Red Florals. Please come to the stage. Congratulations to all of you. What a delight. So you're the real deal, huh? - And now... - I'm sorry? I mean, you have your own shop and everything. I didn't realize you were actually a floral designer. Okay, come on, how many times have you seen me trip and pick up foliage and flowers? I thought maybe you were at some holiday party. Or you could be someone's assistant. So, you work for Blair Covington? She's my mentor. Apparently, she's everyone's mentor. Lastly... We are so thrilled to announce that this year our semi-final theme will be... Drumroll, please. Thank you. Thank you very much. The Twelve Days Of Christmas. Listen, it was very nice to meet you. I just wanna let you know that I plan on winning this entire shebang. Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but not only do I plan on winning, I am going to win. Okay, fine. Okay, fine. - Hello again. - Hi. I heard your presentation was a big hit. Yeah, it's, half-packed up now. - I'm really sorry I missed it. - Oh, it's okay. Here. Here's some holly as a consolation. Ooh. Nice outfit, by the way. How did you get here? - In a horse and carriage? - Yeah. Thank you. Yeah, well, we really try to... - Further the theme. - Further the theme. Yes. Blair mentioned that to me earlier when she was mentoring me on how to design my booth. Well, she does have a very keen eye. I mean, I wouldn't totally discount her advice. You're really Team Blair, aren't you? Twelve years and counting. That said, it helps she is the biggest name in the flower game in this town. Well, seeing as we're sworn enemies, I mean, do you think we should even be having this conversation? I might unearth some invaluable trade secrets. I don't know, I feel like you and I can still be friends, right? We have enough in common. A fellow love of flowers is not necessarily a fine friend to make. Well, how about a fellow love of churros? And of costume design? And of Christmas? How about a conflict of interest? Looks like you're being beckoned. Right. Wish me luck. I'll see you tomorrow at the press conference? Okay. Was that a yes? Okay. This is the real deal, huh? I am so sorry, honey, but your hair is not ready for primetime. - We really should... - It's fine. Just leave it. I believe in the power of good hair. Okay, fine, just at least put this in, so you have some sparkle. Wait, there's that guy. The cute guy I was telling you about. - Ooh, show me. - Don't look, he's gonna see you. Garrett Hurley. The cute guy that works for Covington Designs? No. He had potential to be good, right? Well, who says this isn't giving good? Natalie, I don't need the drama right now. I need to focus on the competition. Well, I'd take out a loan to cash in on that kind of distraction. Oh, my gosh. He saw me looking. Hey, think like a winner. But like a, a fragrant winner. Stop, stop doing it. Welcome to the madness. Yeah, yeah. Wasn't expecting all these reporters to be here. The flower show in Santa Mesa is a big deal. I mean, people go nuts for this. Blair is certainly in her element. Isn't she stealing your thunder? Nah, it's good for the company. I don't really mind. Yeah. Same here. Hey, listen, Poppy, just so you know, I kinda have to win this competition. Yeah, same here. No, you don't, you don't understand. Blair and I have an agreement, so... have to do it. And I need to get a new cooler, so looks like we're in the same boat. But I... are you wearing a new perfume? Poppy! Garrett! This is Jessica Abbott from Channel 15. I think you should speak with her about this competition between the new girl and the old guard. Picture time. Beautiful. Merry Christmas. I brought my best friend a healthy holiday breakfast. Croissants and... Peanut butter with a side of jam. You are jam... I mean, you're a gem. It is a little too early for bad jokes. Clearly, I haven't gotten out lately, so this looks amazing. Thank you. So, how's all the hubbub with the flower show? Exhausting. And how's Blair handling you being in charge? Begrudgingly. And you really gonna go in a deal with her? I mean, it's now or never, right? It's just like, five years is a long time to be doing something you don't wanna do. Yeah, but you know what? That part of the bet doesn't really matter because I am going to win. So I saw you on the local news last night with that cute competitor. She is totally your type. Is she? See? I knew it. - What? - You did the eyebrow thing. That thing you do when you think a girl's cute. Excuse me? The eyebrow doesn't lie. I've known you my whole life. Okay, fine. But you know what? Even if there was a spark, I'm pretty sure she'd be standing by with a bucket of water to put it out. Come on, you're cute, and charming, and you cook, and clean, and do your own laundry. I mean, what more could a gal want? So, I guess she inherited her flower shop from her grandmother, like, six months ago, and... it's not doing so well. So, I assume she's gonna use the winnings to keep things afloat. - Complicated indeed. - Yeah. I mean, basically, if I win everything I want she loses everything she wants. Well, what if I told you I could help you out with your romantic endeavors? What are you talking about? Well, mother's Annual Christmas Fete is coming up, and we need to hire a florist. We'd usually use that Garrett what's-his-name, but, I heard there's a new up-and-coming florist who might be worth a shot. Tiffany Daniels, you are a peach. And the best friend anybody could ever ask for. How can I ever repay you? Insanely expensive shoes for my birthday will do just fine. Okay. Okay. Yes. Okay, thank you. Okay, bye. Guess who just booked a big gig. Blair Covington? Too soon? I'm kidding, I'm kidding. I'm so excited. Tell me everything. Okay, so it's a massive society Christmas party with a 150 invites, and they want center pieces for all the tables. We're gonna need a big order. No, huge order. Giant order. I was told, "Spare no expense". My three favorite words in the English language. Are we gonna have time to do both? - Both? - Hello. The semi-finals round of the competition is tomorrow. Of course. I'm all over it. When there's a will, there's a way. Now that's the Christmas spirit. Okay, so about this society party, I was thinking we should do something modern like, I've been wanting to use Indonesian eucalyptus. What do you think? International flair. I like. Yeah. Maybe, like, with some Christmassy red ombre flowers. Yes. Poppy, that is it. You're in. And in celebration of this very momentous moment... I'm gonna pay the electric bill. Yes! I thought you were coming as a little drummer boy. You know, I don't think I need to wear a costume. I feel like the design speaks for itself. Careful attention to the theme... is part of the reason that Covington Designs has won this flower show for the last 12 years. Is there nothing to be said for tradition? I understand that it's your tradition, Blair, but I thought you said we could try things my way this time around. I do wish the best for you, Garrett. But I must admit that it's things like this that do cause my confidence to waver. Look, I need you to understand I was taught by the best. But now it's time for the master to let her pupil shine. Fine. Fine. But you better shine. Poppy, we're gonna get a drink. Do you want something? - No, I'm okay. Thanks, dad. - Yeah? Okay. Nat? Hello there, fellow competitor. You're so formal. Yes, well, we are very professional over here at Poppy's Petals. Okay. Well, I'm sorry to interrupt. I, I just wanted to see if my friend Tiffany called. You know Tiffany Daniels? Yeah. Yeah, her mom's throwing this big Christmas party, and we're kinda swamped, so... I just mentioned your name. You sent me the referral. - Is that bad? - No, it's... Well, it's just weird that you are supporting your competitor. Oh, come on, we don't have to compete outside the show. I suppose not, I... I just don't know what to say. I'm sorry, did I, did I screw up? No, no, not at all. It's actually very sweet. Thank you. Well, look, maybe you'll agree to have dinner with me after the show? Say yes. What would Blair say? Well, I'm more interested to know what you would say. Just say yes. Yeah. Just say yes. It... I don't know. It just, it just feels very complicated. Okay, well, how's this? If we both make it to the finals, we'll go have dinner together to celebrate. - I'm so going to the finals. - Great. So am I. Done. Okay. - I'm looking forward to dinner. - -Yes! Stop. - What? I didn't do any... - You stop it. Oh, dear. Good evening, and welcome, one and all, to the Santa Mesa Holiday Floral Show semi-final competition. We have had an amazing day of flowers and holiday cheer, ladies and gentlemen. Don't you agree? Yes. I believe the theme could easily have been Holiday Floral Fashion At Its Finest. Let's give all these designers a huge round of applause. And before we announce our top three finalists, I am pleased to announce that theme of this year's flower grand finale in one week will be Alice in a Winter Wonderland. Prepare to be enchanted. And now, the moment you've been waiting for. Our top three contending finalists in no particular order. Audrey and Phil Wilson of Roses Are Red Florals. Our second finalist is... Garrett Hurley of Covington Designs. And our third and last finalist for this year's Santa Mesa Holiday Floral Show is... Poppy Benson of Poppy's Petals. So, looks we have a celebratory dinner tonight. It appears we do. Here's my card with my mobile. Just text me your address. Maybe 7 o'clock? Let me just check my schedule. Yeah. It should be fine. Yeah? Great. Okay. - Hey, Garrett. Come on in. - Hey, Mr. Benson. That's a good-looking tree. Have a seat. So, as the father of, the girl you're about to take on a date, I have to ask. Is this an attempt to, shake down the enemy? For inside information? No, sir. Not at all. Good. Because I'd hate for my daughter to be disappointed. You know, if your intentions weren't on the up and up. I have, I had no plans of disappointing her in, in any way, sir. I assure you. So, what are your intentions? Well, as, as it relates to dinner, it's purely, a date-related. I mean, I mean, the dinner's not a professional date, it's more of a personal... nature. You know, the truth is, I just think your daughter's great. And honestly, I just wanna get to know her better, that's all. Well, I am glad we cleared this up. How about a drink, Garrett? Eggnog? I'm good. I appreciate it. Okay. Well, how about water? 'Cause you're kinda breaking a little sweat. Yeah. I'm feeling a little... Water sounds good. Okay, then. I'll be right back. That wedding picture is my grandparents. This used to be their house. I got you a cookie bouquet. I figured you can't get enough florist flowers, right? Well, thank you. It's, it's very sweet. You look beautiful. Thanks. So, how old are you in this photo? I was eight years old. And that's your mom? Gosh. You really got her eyes. Yeah, apparently, I have her green thumb, too, which she inherited from my grandma. Come see. This... This was my mom's garden. It was amazing. She had all these wild flowers and climbing vines and butterflies and roses. Really magical. Had a lot of fairy tale princess adventures in there. That sounds beautiful. Yeah. Maybe I'll recreate it some day. You should. It'd be like going on a whole new adventure. Yeah, maybe. I come bearing hydration and eggnog. - Hey. - Uh, thank you, dad. But we actually have to get going. That's right. I made a reservation at 7:30. - So... - Okay, fine. But don't stay out too late. You have a big day of making arrangements tomorrow. Yes? Okay. Yes, I do. Okay. All right, I assure you. I will have her back at a reasonable hour. All right. Thank you. Okay. You kids have a good time. Okay. I-I'm sorry. My dad just texted me. The good news is he likes you. I am so sorry he grilled you. I had nothing to do with that. That's okay. He was fine. It was fine. I think he's just concerned with how invested you are with Covington, that's all. Am I? I don't know. I guess I get it. I'm just, I'm torn sometimes between my obligations and my passions, that's all. What do you mean? I just mean I... There's a lot... There's a lot I have left I want to achieve. Well, I'm sure you will, because you're very talented. Whoa. Was that a compliment? Thank you. I'm so sorry. I've been really harsh. I... I just have so much to lose in this competition. Don't we all? You know, maybe there's... some way in which we all end up winning at the end of this, you think? Well, if you have any suggestions, I'm open to hearing them. Or maybe we can just hope that everyone's Christmas wishes come true. Well, sharing this evening with you has certainly been getting things off to a good start. No, no, no. I.. Let me, I insist. Can I, please? You already got me the Country Club gig. I can get this. Please... My pleasure. Tell you what. Why don't you treat me to a dessert, and then we'll call it even? Dessert? Okay. Thank you. This place is so cute. It's very Christmassy. It is very Christmassy. Good coffee, good desserts. So, I was thinking of using Indonesian eucalyptus for Tiffany's mom's party. I want the center pieces to be very edgy. Edgy flowers, huh? That's very rock and roll of you. Are you questioning my rock and roll? I would never question a lady's rock and roll. It's very unchivalrous of me. Seriously though, your passion's really inspiring. I mean it, it-it's really clear that you love what you do. - Can we have two? - I mean, what's not to love? I mean, my job is to make people's lives pretty. Yeah, that's a really great way if think about it. Thank you. - Thank you. - Yum. You know, sometimes, I feel like I get just too caught up in the business side of things. Don't feel bad. It's hard to get caught up in business, especially when you don't have a lot of business. Thank you. You're really talented at what you do, Poppy. You know that? Your grandmother knew what she was doing when she gave you the shop. Thank you. What about you? Do you, plan on staying at Covington Design? You know, I owe Blair a lot. I mean, kinda my whole career. Does it mean she owns you? Well, we're in negotiations about my, my future at the company. But I think after the flower show... maybe some big change is in store. You mean, after I win the flower show. Well, if you play it like that then I am gonna question your rock and roll. Lady or no lady, the gloves are comin' off. Okay. Hey, can we have two espressos, please? So, what got you into floral design? Well, after I graduated from college, I got a master's degree in both Architecture and Business. And then I became Blair's assistant. - Her assistant? - Yeah. Yeah. All-all the places I applied to for jobs thought I was over-qualified. And I didn't have job. I needed one. And so, she took a chance on me when no one else would. Wasn't expecting to hear that. Yeah. She, she and my mom are old friends. And so, you know, I thought she'd be a good place to start, and then I'd move along to something bigger and better, but she was working a... a wedding for a friend, solo and she got in way over her head. Blair Covington in over head? I find that hard to believe. Well, believe it. Yeah, she first had me doing the boy's boutonnieres. And I guess she was impressed with what I did there, and so, then she, you know, had me do the flower arrangements in the foyer. And, yeah, after a while, we both kinda realized not only was it something I was good at, but, you know, something I kinda love doing. That's amazing. Yeah, well, you know, arranging flowers is all architecture. I've always kinda had an eye for symmetry and... and design and... I don't know, you know, maybe I could use a little of what I learned in grad school. Anyways, the rest is just history. I've been with her ever since. I just assumed Covington Designs had been around forever. Well, there was once in time when Blair Covington was the new florist in town. Just like you. She worked hard for her success. We both did. So, what, you just pulled up your bootstraps made a couple boutonnieres and now you're the best-dressed florist in town? Easy as that? Yeah. Just sitting at a candlelit table, drinking an espresso with the most beautiful florist in town. It's as simple as that. Cheers. Okay, this is it. You are officially behind enemy lines. What do you think? It's really cute. It's exactly what I thought your shop would look like. I'm just gonna get these sketches. I can't believe I left them. Okay.! Could I maybe interest you in one of our lovely Christmas arrangements? Maybe something sophisticated and, and charming? Only if I can help. I'm pretty particular about my arrangements. Okay. Well, why don't we see what happens when the new girl and the old guard join forces? Okay. Hah! Keeping my hours, are you? Is this part of your bid for partnership? No, I just woke up happy, that's all. For the final? Nah. About a lot of things. I, I like this. This is fresh and sophisticated. Can we get a photo, for our portfolio? No, I can't, because I didn't actually design it myself. Well, then, who did? Poppy Benson and I made it together. Poppy? How did that come about? I think it's called a... a date, Blair. - A date? - Yeah, it's this great thing. People find each other attractive, they go out, they grab a meal, they get to know each other. And arrange flowers together? Pretty much. Ta-dah. Listen, I gotta put this on my desk. I'll swing by your office and we'll talk about that banquet in New York. - Morning, Marie. - Good morning. - What do you think? - Ooh. You meets cool. I like that. Great, I'll hashtag it and put it on the Petals page. Okay, so if we could just multiply this by thirty, and then, add in twelve or so large arrangements, we've got a party. And it's about T-minus 26 hours until the first center piece hits the table. Are you ready for an all-nighter? If you're willing to meet my terms. - Hit me. - Okay. One of your father's famous fruit cakes with extra-green cherries, and I'm gonna need a lot of caffeine. Okay, well, we have plenty of espresso in the back. And I will put the request in with my dad right now. - Thank you. - Okay. So... no more playing coy, Ms. Benson. I wanna know all about Mr. Covington Designs. He's, he's, actually a really nice guy. Boring. Skip to the good stuff. Okay. He, he smells like cedar and vanilla. Okay. We're getting warmer. And when he puts his arms around me, I feel like a marshmallow melting in hot cocoa. We have a winner. Let's not get ahead of ourselves. This is when you get your happy back. - What? - All the happy you give away? It's finally coming back to you. Okay. We have work to do, let's go. Okay, we're on it. One hundred and forty-five eucalyptus fronds cut and trimmed. Check. Now, only 145 more to go. I was just gonna leave for the night. Don't you think it's a little dim in here? You can't do your best work if you have to squint to see. Nah, the atmosphere helps me focus. Your focus is something I've wanted to speak with you about. Is there a problem? Well, I know that you've, become fond of that Poppy girl. - Yes. - So, I'll just be blunt. When are you ever anything but? She's a direct competitor. So I think you might consider what her motivation is for becoming friendly with you. What are you trying to say? I don't want you to lose your edge... just because you've become smitten with some girl who could just be trying to distract you from winning. Look, Blair, I know you like to be in control of everything... You have a lot riding on this, Garrett. We both do. You know, my personal life is not a subsidiary of Covington Designs. I just have your best interest at heart. Well, I'm not so sure. Well, it's late, and you, you're tired, so... call it a night soon and tomorrow, everything will be fresh and new. How so? Goodnight. Okay. Just move that box. - Okay. - Thank you. Over there. Okay, great. Excuse me, are you the famous Poppy from Poppy's Petals? Maybe. Who's asking? Breakfast croissant delivery service. I mean, you can't properly arrange flowers on an empty stomach. It's peanut butter and jelly. It's my favorite. How did you know? - Lucky guess. - This look delicious. - Thank you. - Hi, I'm Natalie. Remember? We met. Okay, we gotta go. I know this looks delicious. Put it down. We gotta go. We've got flowers wilting in there. - Okay. Okay. - All right. - Thank you. - Yeah. See you later, right? Yeah. I'll see you there. Okay. - Bye, Natalie. - Bye! You left the backdoor... Yeah. . Could you? Thank you. You don't have to wait, we'll be fine. I'm gonna call Joe. Just pop the hood. I'll, I'll check it. Does he know about... Do you know anything about cars? Well, I know Edna's irreplaceable. You remember her name. I don't know what all I can do, but at least I'll take a look. Okay. Nat, could you call Joe? Yeah, I'm on it. I can't believe this is happening. I don't know what the problem is. Well, with Edna, the question is, "What isn't the problem?" If we don't leave for Tiffany's party now, we're gonna miss it. Well, Joe said he can't be here for an hour and a half. I think I have a solution pulling up right now. Garrett, what is this? Okay. Today, we're giving Cranky Edna a rest. Come help me unload these, arrangements. You don't wanna miss the party, do you? - No. - Nice. - Okay, come on. - Okay, okay. Thanks, buddy. I think that's it. We did it. And we finished a little early which leaves me time to freshen up for my holiday date tonight. - Ooh! - I mean, that is... If you don't need me anymore. Nope. All the heavy-lifting is done. I'm gonna stick around and wait for the party to begin. I want Tiffany to tell me how much she loves it. She's gonna love it. And these smell amazing. This eucalyptus was the perfect touch. Yeah. Okay, scoot. But don't stay out too late. I need you fresh for the competition in the morning. I was born fresh. Thank you. - The flowers are lovely, dear. - Thank you. Yeah, I'm really happy how everything turned out. And you look nice, as well. Well, thank you. I mean, you look amazing. I could never wear anything like that. I would undoubtedly spill something on it. I suppose it does take a little grace or something to pull it off. Aren't they a picture of perfection? Garrett and Tiffany. - What do you mean? - Well... I mean, supposedly, they're just friends right now. But everyone knows that there's unrequited flame between them that could go off at any moment and... I mean, why shouldn't it? They've been so close for so many years. Not to mention, they look perfect together. Poppy, dear, are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine, I... just wanna make sure everything looks perfect for the party. It'll be wonderful. Everything happens as it should and... and someday soon, those two will realize it, as well. You know, I know that we did not start off on the right foot. But I assure you, as I've been there, it's not wise for a woman to give her heart to a man who's really pining for someone else. Right. Could someone get her a tissue? - My... - Tiffany, Tiffany, look. Oh, Poppy. Eucalyptus? My grandmother is horribly allergic. - Excuse me. - -I didn't tell you. What do I do? We're on it. We're on it. Okay. I think that's all of it. What else can I do? No, you just go back to your party. - I think you've done enough. - What's wrong? I told you I was using eucalyptus. Are you gonna try and tell me you didn't know that your girlfriend's grandmother would literally keel over at the sight of a eucalyptus branch? My girlfriend? It's not a secret. Blair told me your past and your future. Wait, Blair told you what exactly? Don't worry about it, Garrett. I knew I shouldn't have trusted you. It was quite clear this entire time you have been stringing me all along just like your boss. Okay, Poppy, you've got it all wrong. Apparently, I do. Poppy... Are you feeling better, grandma? I am, sweetheart. Thank you. Well, bless Tiffany's heart. But this is what happens when you use an inexperienced vendor. Hey, Blair. Can I... Why did you tell Poppy that Tiffany's my girlfriend? Girlfriend? I never said anything of the sort. Is, is winning that important that you're willing to hurt me to do it? I want you to succeed, Garrett. None of this is for me. I think you're scared because she's good. You're better. Well, that remains to be seen, but you know what, I'm willing to let the judges decide. This is silly. You know, we can discuss this tomorrow, Garrett, privately. We had a deal, Blair. If I lose, I sign on for five more years. But I know I can win this thing without your... tactics. So, please, let me do this on my own. Fine. I'm a spectator. I yield to your endeavors. Okay? Look, it's Governor Stratton. I will go say hello. Joe. So did I. Poppy? Poppy, it's dad. Are you okay? I made you peanut butter and jelly toast. Let me try. Hey, Poppy. It's Natalie. Come on, you gotta get up. It's show time. We need to get to the finals. I'm not going anywhere. Edna's not moving and I'm not moving. It's over. Poppy Hyacinth Benson, what would your grandmother say if she saw you giving up like this? What would your mother say? I gave someone an allergic reaction with my flowers. Eucalyptus, of all things. Who's allergic to eucalyptus? Poppy, please let us in. No. I can do everything from here. I got a cell phone, I got a hot-spot... Yeah, well you're gonna be in the hot-seat if you don't get it together and get ready. Come on! Hold on. One, two, three. No! I don't have to go anywhere. I have rights. Poppy... you-you're down but not out. So, get up, get dressed, young lady, and let's go win this final. No, dad, the structure to my displays don't fit in any cars, and Edna... Dad, please don't open the window. I don't need any vitamin-D. Would you quit feeling sorry for yourself for one second and look out the window? We got a surprise for you. Merry Christmas, sleepyhead. Why is Joe here? Natalie called him this morning. Why? Just get out here already. I'll show you. - Come on. - Come on. Let's do it for Edna. For Edna. Yes! Looks like Poppy's Petals is a no-show. - That's too bad. - Oh, please. You nearly buckled under the pressure, too. I did not. Well, looks like your girl's a no-show. I'm so sorry, Garrett. But at least now you're practically a shoo-in to win. We all know that Roses Are Red Florals has nothing on Covington Designs. That's true. Can't you at least be a little bit excited? Cheery good morning to all our designers and teams. Designers, teams, would you please come down to the podium? Thank you, thank you. Thank you, thank you. Of course, we have a short bit of business before we start. I'd like to start by thanking all of our sponsors today who are making this possible. Thank you. Garrett, where are you going? What took you so long? If you're not in the booth at the time that clock starts, you forfeit the competition. I am perfectly fine carrying this by myself, Garrett. Let me help you carry this, Poppy, please. Come on. For once, will you let somebody help you? Look, Tiffany's not my girlfriend. She's never been my girlfriend, okay? We've just been friends forever. How am I supposed to believe you? - Let me help you with that. - No, it's fine. I mean, would I really be down here dying under this giant tea cup if I wanted it any other way? I suppose not. Thank you for helping me again. You're welcome. But why? I thought you wanted to win this competition. I did. I do. I just... If I'm gonna win, I wanna do it fair and square. And if I lose... I want it to be to you. You know, I would kiss you if I could move. Well, here, let me help. - Everything okay down there? - Yeah. Two turtle love doves. Don't we have a final to get to? - You ready? - Let's do this. Oh, dear, it looks as if we're missing Miss Benson and Mr. Hurley. It appears that the winners will be... - We're here. - Wait, wait, wait, we're here! Cutting it close! - We're here. - We're here. I can see this is going to be a very exciting day! Okay, finalists, are you ready? Then let the finals begin! Okay, guys. Sorry, I'm late. I need few things. Fake snow... Real snow. - Okay. - Let's go. Now, let's break this open. Garrett, I thought you wanted to win this thing? Or maybe you want to spend another five years with me? You know, there are worse things than losing, Blair. It's Christmas time. Remember? And what's important this time of year is that everybody gets a chance to-to work hard at something greater, to find hope in-in things that are out of their control, to, to realize that, you know, lending a helping hand is far greater than any cash prize. I remember, I remember when you thought you were nobody and you asked for my help that day. I just miss the girl who... trusted in people enough to ask for a helping hand. Anyway, I got to get back to work because Blair Covington has to win, right? Designers! You have two hours! Okay, Pops, it's time to make your Christmas wish come true. Yes. Okay. So, whole right here. And the eyes here and then the... Designers, you have one hour left! Designers, you have one minute left. - Blair! What are you doing? - -Oh, no. The clock. - I'm just trying to help. - Oh, gosh, uh... Find me some, floral wire. Everything's already packed up. Just some string or anything. Okay, I'll be right back. Yikes. Okay. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one! Designers, step away from your designs. Let the judging begin. Thank you. Did you see the smiles on their faces? You did it, Pop. No, we did it. Thank you guys so much. It just looks so lifelike. Makes me wanna dip a cookie in it. What? They had Christmas cookies on the refreshment table, so I grabbed a few. Cute. Thanks. They should give you extra points for helping the competition out. No, I had to. He's been helping me on numerous amounts of times. I felt like I needed to. Well, your grandmother and your mother would be very, very proud of you. Thank you. I just want you guys to know I really appreciate it, and that... I mean that from the bottom of my heart. Hey, are you kidding? I just came here for the cookies. Seriously, you guys are the best. And no matter what happens, I just want you to know that I wouldn't do this any differently. I just want to be with you guys. - And especially me. - Yes. Okay. Team Poppy, let's bring it in. We will meet back here in exactly one hour to announce the winners. And in the meantime, please, enjoy the refreshments. That's what they're for. Will all the finalists please move down to the stage? Thank you. Thank you very much. It's been a day of ups and downs, fierce competition, and, of course, the magic of the season. I, for one, could not be more proud to be a member of the Santa Mesa Floral Community. And how about all of you? But enough of my emotional gushes. Let's announce our runners up, shall we? All right, in third place, Audrey and Phil Wilson of Roses Are Red Florals. Congratulations. And if the two remaining finalists, will please come forward. Which one of these two incredible designers will win this year's competition? I really do wish you the best. You, too. And the winner is... Poppy Benson... of Poppy's Petals! Wonderful! Congratulations! I'm sorry I didn't win, Blair, I... - I know you're disappointed. - No, no, dear. No. I am so proud of what you've done here today. I really am. And you will always be my winner. I am so sorry for how badly I behaved. Good, because I'm gonna be around for a while longer. Five years with or without the promise of a partnership. Yeah, no. Now that you've had a taste of being in charge, you would be insufferable and I couldn't possibly keep you around. I, I don't understand. I think it's time that you submit your resignation to Covington, for good. - So you're, you're firing me? - No. I'm telling you to go off and be the second-best florist in Santa Mesa. Well, can I keep all my long-term clients? Thank you for teaching me so well. Yeah. Maybe too well. Yes. You know, I guess, maybe what we've learned is that a little healthy competition never hurt anybody. - Congratulations. - Thank you. I suppose I should go be gracious and congratulate the woman who beat Covington finally after all these years. And I'll see you both at next year's competition. You're still number one in our book. Thanks, squad. I just wanted to offer you my sincere congratulations, Miss Benson. Thank you. Well, I was wondering if I could speak with you in private for a moment, dear? - I've got your back. - Thank you. I haven't exactly been, kind to you throughout this competition, dear. Not exactly. But that's because I thought you were trying to distract Garrett from winning. No, you're wrong. Either way, I owe you an apology. Apology accepted. I'm too much of a fan of yours not to, you know. Thank you, dear. And you know, I'm not the only one with a fan here. Garrett really does care for you, and I'm just so sorry that I... that I just deceived you into thinking that he doesn't. No, that's okay. I feel like I already knew he did. I was just, I don't know, too insecure to believe it until now. Okay, good. Do me a favor and tell your friends I was just awful with you. I do have a reputation to uphold. Okay. Thank you. Yeah, sweetie. I'm so stinkin' excited for us! Wait, does this mean I can add Award-Winning Florist to my resume? Yes! Hey, you. Congratulations. Looks like that multitasking finally paid off. Thank you. Is it stupid that I'm also incredibly sad you didn't win? No, you're not. But that's okay. Can I be both? You know, in a way, I feel like I kind of did win today. Yeah? Why? Well, because I finally got you under the mistletoe. Look who it is. Hey! Merry Christmas! Lovely. Beautiful. Thank you. Hi. Hello. And a Merry Christmas. Would you like an eggnog? Rip-Fixes-Sync by VaVooM
