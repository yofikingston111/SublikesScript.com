Looks great, Liam. Thanks, Ms. Tate. Not in the hallway, thank you very much. Addison, Addison, the photocopier is down again. Is there any room in the quarterly for us to... Phil, we're at the point where we may have to start bending back staples and re-using them. Oh, lovely. We'll be down to writing with quills by year's end. As long as you make your own. Three in a month gets you picking up garbage at recess. Oh. My caffeine angel. Christmas blend? - Yup. - Hint of cinnamon? - A whisper. - Soy milk? Check. Thanks, Judy. I know, I'm a pain. No, I'm sure a lot of people change their coffee routine with the seasons and major holidays. Well, I thank you. Don't forget there's a budget call at eleven, okay, Addy? Yep. Too hot? It's perfect. I know enrollment is down a little, but our test scores are among the best in the district. Forcing these kids to bus an hour away will kill any chance they have for after-school activities. Closing the school is short-sighted in my opinion. Thank you for your time, Superintendent McKenzie. Good timing, Jude. I didn't want you to lose your job today. It's your anniversary. Oh. It's a year to the day since Mark and I broke up. C'mon, sweetie. Tonight, it's you, me, a whole bunch of chick flicks, while we make Christmas decorations. I don't have any glue sticks for the glue gun. Got you covered. What would I do without you, Jude? I appreciate your help, Phil. Ah, well, everyone's prep time's been cut. We'll all either be replaced by robots or instructional videos because they don't take sick days. I'd be surprised if we make it through the year. Sorry, Addison. I didn't mean to be so pessimistic, it's just, uh... ...rumours are rampant. Which is why I'm counting on you to do your best under the circumstances. It's about what's best for the kids, right? Dylan Davidson. Anyhow, in other news, Jude, you're still organizing the staff secret Santa? You bet you. Same deal, twenty dollar max, no re-gifting this year? Dylan Davidson, didn't he go here with Addison? High school, too, and, apparently, they were quite close. Close-close? I'm not one to gossip about my bestie. Really? Well, if I were to theorize... Oh, hypothetically. Of course. He'd be the one that got away. How long, Garth? Three weeks filming, Dylan. What's the director's name again? Gaston Lapointe. He's supposed to be pretty good. It's a French production shot in Bulgaria with a Czech crew. It'll be like working at the U.N. What happened to Seascape Six? You didn't want to do five and you were replaced. Last couple of movies you did, they bombed. You mean "underperformed." Just do the gig, Dylan. It'd be good exposure for you. Is it in English? Maybe this is where you're at career-wise. A lot of people would think getting paid to do a movie in Europe would be like a dream come true. You used to. It's not about the money, Garth. It's about... The work. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Look, those meaty roles are not coming in right now. It is what it is. It has been pretty quiet. Ooh. Garth Turnbull here. Yeah. A different direction, different look, someone with a lot more heat. Well, I can't help but think that you're making a mistake. My guy would've just killed that role. Okay, then, I'll talk to you later. All right, bye. They went with, uh, that other guy, you know, the one with the show. The one with the talking dog? - Mm-hm. - He's good. - Him or the dog? - Not funny. Look, it's not as if you're going out of your way to schmooze or take advantage of social media. Monique always hated that, my low profile ways. How's she taking it, anyway? About how you'd think. You got to stop dating models. I know. I need someone with substance. You need someone that you can talk to, someone I can talk to, someone that can make your eyes light up. I appreciate the help, Addy. I know how crazy things are for you at the moment. Oh, I love helping, Dad. I love when I go home and my clothes still smell like Christmas trees. Have you picked out your tree yet? No! Well, that's not like you at all. I don't have time to properly decorate it and I can't have it sitting in the living room naked. No, you can't do that. So, uh... I, um... I saw somebody today. - Yeah? - Yeah, Mark was in. How'd he look? Ah, fine, I guess. No massive weight gain? - Nope. - He still have all his hair? - Yup. - No humpback-like growths? No. No, humpback like growths. Was he by himself? Well, not exactly. Not exactly with who? Uh, Dee-Dee Lockert. Wow. Great. Yeah. Yeah, that's... that's really great. Did they look happy? I'm sorry. You know, I shouldn't even have mentioned it. I... Should I be making hot chocolate right about now? Yes, that would be lovely. He wasn't the one. He wasn't, was he? And you were too good for him. I was, wasn't I? Two marshmallows? Yes, please. Hey, Garth. Did we have a meeting? No, we got a problem. It's Monique. Now what? She's writing a book. Okay, someone's ghost-writing the book, but they're talking to unnamed sources. How worried should I be? She's booking afternoon talk shows. Nothing late night yet, but getting out of L.A. for a little while would be best, just while she's trying to stir things up. - Well, where would I go? - I don't know. What about me getting behind the camera? Some indie work. You mean like directing? Yeah. Is that so crazy? After being the bane of directors for so many years, now you want to be one. Yeah. Shape the clay instead of being the clay. No, poetry's not in your future. All right. But directing, not a bad idea, if you're willing to start small. How small? Okay. "It's a Wonderful Elf"? I know that directing a play isn't exactly in your wheelhouse, Phil, but I think you'll do a great job. No other volunteers, huh? Not a one, but I volunteer you. There's a literature conference in Florida that I could get a lot out of. - When? - March. If we're still a going concern in March, I'd give it a definite maybe. Hmm. Slightly better odds than the lotto. Thanks, Phil. Mr. Johnson is going to need a lot of cooperation to make this play work. I'm counting on you to help keep the other kids focused. No one listens to me, Ms. Tate. Remember, you don't have to be loud to be heard, Liam. Leading by example seems more your style. If you take it seriously, the other kids will, too. It took a lot of courage to step up and do this. I'm trying to step outside my comfort zone a little bit. Good for you. Get back to class. Mission City S.O.S. How did it go with the kids today? Oh, the kids understand. There's just a lot going on in their world right now. What about yours? Are you going to do any dating before the New Year? There's that guy at... No, no. My heart's not in it. Well, the rest of you could be. No New Year's Eve kisses two years in a row? - Ouch! - Sorry. Don't give up, okay? Anything for you. Good things can still happen. I know. Speaking of, how'd you do with the phone blitz? Every member of Congress I tried to get a hold of was already on holidays. It's like those people don't work! My highlight was a nice lady from Senator Pearson's office gave me a recipe for nutmeg logs. Ooh, interesting. I'm gonna need that recipe. You think it's too late for a bake sale? We sold the muffin tins for pencils, remember? I got to go to choir practice. Hit some high notes for me. ♪ La, la, la, la, la ♪ Ooh, Mission City S.O.S. Addy, I'm just checking the connections here. Can you tell me if you see anything? Nope. - How 'bout now? - No. Now? It's over between Dylan Davidson - and Monique Monteith. - Dylan Davidson. I'm sorry. Was that a yes? Yes, yeah. Yeah. Earlier this week at the premiere of her new movie, while her heartthrob beau was conspicuously absent. You know, you never really get over your first big crush. You're lucky yours was Mom. Yeah. That I was. So, what's going on with the school? Parent and community groups are working more than I have a right to expect right before Christmas. We're gonna do it. Now, that's the spirit! Plus, I'm hoping for a Christmas miracle. Well, I think you're about due. You can say that again. I think you're about due. Well, you got to start somewhere. Hey, Addy. Judy, I've got an idea. Can you come in early tomorrow? Will there be cinnamon buns? With extra icing. All right, then. Shut the door, Addy. This isn't going to be pretty. I might need to re-apply my make-up. So, your grand plan is to get Mission City alumnus Dylan 'The Dream' Davidson, the man who broke your heart in senior year, to direct our Christmas play. Thereby creating publicity and overall social awareness for our and his school's current economic crisis. And you're basing this on what exactly? His ex-girlfriend is all over social media. His career is in the dumpster. He needs positive publicity and he owes me. Does he know he owes you or is this some kind of karmic piggy bank thing that you've invented? There might be a slightly porcine karmic aspect to it. Okay, if that's all we got. Believe me, that's all we've got. Hi, Dad. Hi, Bill! He says hi. What's up? Everything okay? Oh. Okay. Thanks for letting me know. Bye. A friend of my Dad's down at county hall told him they've started the tendering process to sell the school outright. Thought I should know sooner than later. So, it's a done deal? Not quite, but it's getting close. I got his number! Amazing. Yes, good morning. I am looking for Dylan Davidson's manager. Well, this is the number that's listed. Okay. It's Principal Addison Tate of Mission City Middle School, reaching out to alumnus Dylan Davidson. When can I expect a call back? It's very, very important. This is life or death for our school. No, not literally. It's just... Yes. I'd appreciate that. Thank you. Well? Maybe next week. They said he's filming a pilot. It's a business lie. Like "The cheque's in the mail." Was that his publicist? It was. May I? Oh, you have some experience doing this. Well, in a need to know world, I need to know. And voila! That is Dylan's manager Garth Turnbull, his email address and cell phone number. A-plus Phil. I'll leave you to it. You have some telephone calls to make, Principal Tate. Thank you. Dialling for dollars? Cha-ching. Have you heard of Mission City Middle School? That's my old grade school. How'd they get my number? I don't know. Maybe they want some swag for an auction or something. All right. You gonna answer that? No, I'm going to let my voice mail handle that. Garth Turnbull here, please leave a message after the beat. Hello, this is Principal Addison Tate from Mission City Middle School. If Mr. Davidson would be interested in taking some time out of his busy schedule, we could certainly use his expertise in directing our school play and it might help save the school in the process. So, if you could give me a call back to discuss, I'd really appreciate it. Voice sounds really familiar. What'd she say her name was? No, that part was garbled. I couldn't make it out. Garth Turnbull here, please leave a message after the beat. Hello, Mr. Turnbull, it's Addison Tate, the principal at Mission City Middle School calling again, um, just in regards to your client Dylan Davison directing our school play. If you could call me back, I'd really appreciate it. Garth Turnbull here, please leave a message after the beat. Oh, hi, Mr. Turnbull. It's Addison Tate. Can I call you Garth? I mean, it really feels like I should be able to call you Garth, seeing as I've heard your voice so many times. Call me back, please? Addison Tate here, if I didn't mention that already. It's Addison Tate. Addison Tate here. Just asking for Dylan's help to save our school. That's it in a nutshell. "Hollywood star saves old middle school." It's a great headline. Could you just call me back, please? Please. No, I'm not getting enough of a response on Twitter. This book will never get off the ground. Something juicy? Yeah, that's just it, there's nothing juicy! Dylan is what he is, he's a decent guy. No dirt. Salacious? No, he doesn't drool. Maybe a little in his sleep. Why? Would they want that in a book? Good. I'll think of something else. Now, let's see what that does. I can't believe Monique would even post that. I know. I mean, we were rehearsing for a part I didn't even get. It's totally out of context. - What's the reaction been? - It's not good. PR firm's saying the same thing, that negative traction is negative traction. Still nothing? Well, are you gonna try again? - I don't know. - Here, let me call. - I'll do it. Wait, how many times have you called? Counting this time? Thirty-four. He's going to think you're a stalker! No, he won't. He already knows I'm a stalker. It was so much easier keeping tabs on her when we were together. Unchecked, she's like a blonde tornado. And you're like a trailer park. Thanks. Oh, it's your old grade school calling. Let's give them a gracious no. Put it on speaker. Garth Turnbull here. How can I help you? Uh... Hello. This is Addison Tate. I'm... I'm the principal here at Mission City Middle School. I was actually hoping that we could help each other. I've left you a few messages. Yeah, I got 'em. So, what's in it for, Dylan? Um, well... Dylan was recently the recipient of some pretty bad, totally unsubstantiated publicity. Saving his hometown school from the wrecking ball might be just the ticket to combat that negative press. Wow, she's good. Is this really Addy Tate? I say we do it. What do we have to lose? Hello, Addy? That's Dylan. - Hello? - What do I say? Oh, my gosh. That's Dylan. Hi! Yes. Yes, it is I, Addison Tate. Wow, it's great to hear from you! You're still as articulate as ever. Okay, let me handle this. Ms. Tate, we would like to accept your offer and Dylan will direct your school play. Thank you, thank you so much. You have no idea what this'll mean to the kids. Hey, Addy, is, um... is Robinson's Bakery still around? I'll have a dozen chocolate chip cookies waiting. Yeah, and what's the weather like? Um, it's, uh, just like spring. A balmy 38 today. Okay, that sounds very spring-like. When do you need Dylan there? - Yesterday. - How's Thursday? - Thursday is great. - I'll send you my email. I just sent you an itinerary. Of course you did! Hey, Addy? I can't wait to see you. We'll see you Thursday. Thank you so much. I-I can't wait to see you, too. You, too. "I can't wait to see you!" Look at you, man! Whoo! Hi! Morning, sunshine. Oh, I don't feel much like sunshine at the moment. I think that I did something that I may regret. Okay, well, now, you got to spill it. A hint of cinnamon? Yeah, and soy milk. And? I got Dylan Davidson to agree to direct our Christmas play. Wow. Really? You think that'll work? I don't know, but I had to try. I mean, if they close the school I'd just be kicking myself. Well, how do you feel about Dylan coming back? Fine. It was a long time ago. I doubt he even remembers. Dad, you're killing me. I don't even have time to go to the gym. They're waffles. So, you have a power bar for lunch and you have a salad with lean protein for dinner. It's about balance, Addy. How can you turn waffles into a life lesson and dietary advice? It takes practice. Delicious. Mm-hm. Ooh. - You cold? - Oh, yeah. Dylan Davison, what's it like being back in your hometown? Uh, well, I literally just got in, but it's, uh... it's great to be back in Mission City, and to have the opportunity to give back to the community, but, really, this is Mission City Middle School Principal Addison Tate's... And you and Principal Tate are... We're old classmates, but we lost touch after I went to theatre school. - Here's my card. - Thank you. ♪ It's that time of year ♪ When Santa comes to bring that cheer ♪ ♪ He ain't coming by boat or plane ♪ ♪ He's loaded down with candy canes ♪ ♪ I only hope he keeps one open seat ♪ ♪ Oh yeah ♪ ♪ Come on, Santa, bring those toys ♪ ♪ All the presents for the girls and boys ♪ ♪ The only thing I need ♪ Is my baby on Christmas Eve Thanks. I'll be right with you. Just want to take care of a few of these kiddies first. You told her that? The sign outside said it's for sale. We can't let her down. I never really doubted you. It was just my silly common sense. And you and Principal Tate are... We're old classmates, but we lost touch after I went to theatre school. Aww. Oh my gosh, these are good. I wonder what she's up to, huh? It's called Christmas spirit, Phil. Humbug. So many things have been given up because of the budget cuts, but I'm just not willing to lose the hot lunch program, it's too important for the kids. Make sure that they... Sorry. Dylan. Hey, Addy. Hey. Oh. Uh, should it be Ms. Tate on school grounds? No. The kids all know my name's Addy, so you're not giving away any state secrets. Good. You're already on the local news. The reporter. I, uh, I kept it pretty bland. I mean, if I had said that we were good friends, then it'd lead to speculation. You don't need to explain anything. No, I do. If the press thought that there was anything between us, then you'd have a camera truck parked out in front of your house. Apartment. I live in an apartment. And this is Mission City, I don't even think the local TV station even has a truck. They just walk everywhere. Okay, but you get the idea. Yeah. Sure. And thank you for reaching out. I really needed to get out of L.A., with this whole Monique thing. The supermodel ex. Yeah. Nightmare. In really nice designer shoes. I'd do anything to save the school or else I wouldn't have called you. Well, tell me all about it. All right. You want the long version or the Cliff Notes? I will take the long version. It's kind of nice hearing your voice again. You're getting the Cliff Notes. I'm a busy woman. I bet you are. Not quite as busy as a Hollywood superstar, I'm guessing. Thanks, Addy. I'll take it from here. You sure? I got this. Go save your school. Okay. I mean, great, yeah. Um, I'll just... I'll leave you to it. Hey, everyone. Why don't you grab a seat? Anyone sitting here? No? Now, as some of you may know, my name is Dylan Davidson, and what I'm going to say to you was said to me for my first big role by someone far, far smarter than me. No one is bigger than the production. We are all but disparate parts working together in harmony, and we support each other to bring the play to its successful conclusion. Any questions? What does "disparate" mean? Let's just get to it, shall we? All right. Let's move the bags and chairs and stuff and see what you got. Santa's not coming? But why? What will the children think? Okay. Liam, um... Santa's not coming, okay? And you need to believe that in your heart to make the audience believe that. Think about the anticipation of unwrapping that big shiny present, but then, it's not there. There's nothing under the tree. What was the best present you ever got? Xbox. Yeah. Okay, great. So, think about that. Think about the waiting. All your friends, they're playing online and you think you're going to get it and then... Bam! Nothing. Nothing. What would the children think? Let's try it again, but this time from the heart. Santa's not coming? But why? What will the children think? That was amazing. All right, get out of here, you guys, for now. Quick meeting after school. Good job, everybody. You are surprisingly good with them. Well, that's why I get paid the big bucks. I didn't know what to expect. Look, I get it. I get it. But it just... I don't know. Feels good to be doing something worthwhile for a change. Seeing how dialled in these kids are, seeing their potential, I see why you love doing what you do. But, Addy, um, I have to say, these kids, they seem tense. It's like there's a real negative energy around here. I know. I know. I think we need to create a bonding moment. Do you remember Mr. Dawson and that ancient projector he'd pull out? We still have it. Movie night? And here comes the scared baby, my kid brother Harry Bailey. I'm not scared! Go, Harry! Come on, Harry! Come on, Harry! Come on, Harry! Come on! Help! Hang on, Harry! Help! Help! Hey, okay, do you see how emotionally invested those characters are? Okay, that's what I need from you guys. If you don't believe it in your soul, your audience is never going to believe it. Okay, well, they might give you some slack because they are your parents, but you know what I'm saying, right? Okay. Watch. George saved his brother's life that day. Um, that was a really nice teaching moment. I suppose it was, wasn't it? I wish I had a million dollars. Oh! Technical difficulties here, guys. Sorry. I think you'll have to catch the end on TV. It's on about fifteen times before Christmas. Yeah, and study your lines, okay? You got to know those things cold. Hey. I'm expecting big things from you, Liam. May, I walk you home, Ms. Tate? Well, Mr. Davidson, that would be very lovely. I don't know how you do it. What's that? Being you. Being famous. Being on all the time. It's not so bad. Do you still like it? Sure. It's given me a great life. Some parts of it are kind of lonely. People wanting Dylan 'The Dream' instead of just regular old Dylan. Oh, you were never just regular old Dylan. It's who I'm most comfortable being, anyhow. I think you were always bigger than Mission City. Even when we were kids, I could see that. While you were alphabetizing your toys? They are more fun when they were in alphabetical order. So, what about you, hm? Shaper of young minds. Fighting the good fight for the community. I'm not sure about any of it anymore. Really? I miss being in the classroom, making that kind of difference. Watching the kids learn and grow, that was fulfilling. Now, I'm just an administrator, chasing after money for a budget. Not feeling a whole lot of satisfaction from that. If we could go back... Can I... can I tell you something? Sure. It's been bugging me for a long time. Okay. When I left for Julliard, I never said goodbye. Things were so hectic and the scholarship was so last minute, but I've always regretted it. You had to do what was best for you. I never really gave it much thought. Oh. Okay. What is it? It's my Dad, he needs me to go to the tree lot. That's weird, he never texts. Something's up. We should go. Dad, are you okay? Yeah. Yeah. I'm fine. Wow, Dylan Davidson. It's good to see you again. - You too, Mr. Tate. - Call me Bill. What did you do to your arm? I, uh, I may have sprained my elbow. How did it happen? I fell off a ladder. You believe that? I'm with the fire department 35 years, I fall off a six-foot stepladder? Oh, Dad. Think you'll still be able to play Santa in the Christmas play? I've done it for the last seven years and I will not let this stop me. Garth, hey. I texted him. He's great in a crisis. Addy, this is Garth Turnbull, my long-time manager. Ms. Tate. Everything okay? - Yeah. - No. I'll be fine. Dad, you're gonna need some help. Can I lend a hand? You know, kind of need one of those right about now. Used to sell a lot of these Christmas trees In my day. All right. Okay. Thanks. All right. Well, I'm gonna need a few things, a parka, work gloves, thermal underwear, snow boots, and Merino wool socks. You know where I can pick those up? Anderson's Outfitters, that's the best place in town. It's the only place in town. Bill, why don't you let me take you home? I'll come back here for the night, and keep an eye on the place. That's a great idea. Thank you. Then, you get a good night's sleep in your own bed. I don't know. I can head to Anderson's in the morning and you can show me the ropes. Come on, Dad. All right, fine. Done. All right. Good night. Take care of yourself. Thank you. No problem. Wow, this place is awesome. Are you hungry? Uh, famished. The kids finished all the pizza. Jackpot! He already made some waffle batter. Cool. You know how to make 'em? Wow. Okay, these look really good. My dad would say it's all in the batter. Bon appetit. I haven't had a carb this good in years. Right? Stop it. Wow. Hey, um... Are you seeing anyone? Sorry. Are you okay? Hey, let me help you with that. Hello. Hey, Garth. Oh, let me guess. My dad took you to McElhenney's for a nightcap? Just a drop to help the poor man sleep. Of course. Hey, Dylan, why don't you, uh, walk Ms. Tate home? You... you don't have to. I guess I should do what the man says. Good night. I'm gonna lock up for the night. Smells like waffles. Oh, we saved you some. Thanks. I'm sorry about prying if you were seeing someone. Oh, no, no. It's okay. And it's a hard no on the man in my life front. - Huh. - Why'd you ask? I'm just surprised nobody's snapped you up. I know, right? I was engaged, but we broke up around this time last year. Oh. Well, I'm sorry to hear that. Obviously, the man's a fool. Obviously. What about you? Oh, you know, the whole Monique thing was the hot mess that never seemed to end. And before that, I was just focused on my work. Okay, yeah, so there were some other girlfriends, but nothing serious. I mean, I could never talk to anyone the way I could talk to you. Sorry. Must be important, it's the Bat line. You have a Bat line? Yeah. Don't you? One sec. Hey. What? Why? Really? Dylan! We need to talk. I'll let you two talk. Could you book me a room in Dylan's hotel, please? - No, she's not... - Not your assistant? No. This is my old friend Addison Tate. Addy, this is Monique. Well, any friend of Dylan's. We don't actually have a hotel or motel. No, you know what? Monique, I thought I made myself pretty clear. Please, let's just talk, okay? Could you be a dear and book that room for me, Madison? It's Addison. I'm sorry. I'm terrible with names. But if you could, that'd be great. I'll look into it. - Wait. - I missed you. - Well, I didn't! - You didn't miss me? No! I thought we talked about this. A little bit? No. Why do you have such a big bag? So, you got her a place? I got her in at Bedford's. That's where Dylan is staying, and it's nice! I know! Oh, Addison, have I taught you nothing? You could have got her in at Haberman's across town. It's not bad. Look, as long as she's not a distraction, I don't care. So, do you think they're gonna get back together? I don't know. Well, would it bother you if they did? Totally ambivalent. I mean, me and Dylan Davison? Come on. You could totally do the red carpet. I could, couldn't I? I even know what shoes I would wear. Oh, come on, seriously. How close were you two? Well... It was the best summer ever. We did practically everything. Camp counsellors together, hung out down by the lake together, just talking. We had this amazing connection. It was like we could feel each other's thoughts. I mean, it's crazy. We were just kids, but there was this... Energy around us that was so innocent and pure, and even though we were young, I could see that he could be the one. But we never got a chance to give it a try. That scholarship to Julliard was my ticket out of town. And after that, we just lost touch. We got busy with different lives, moved on. But I never forgot that feeling I had when we were together. Anyhow, that was a long time ago. That was a long time ago. Hey, Addy! Uh, hi, Dylan! Hey, Garth. Hi. Uh, Garth, this is my friend and co-worker Judy. Hi. Uh, thanks for finding a place for Monique to stay. Oh, yeah, no problem. I mean, just let me keep the director happy. Right. Okay. Well, I'll see you in the morning. Yeah, bright and early. - Right. - Yeah. Okay. So, there's no interest there? Nope, none. Okay, kids. See you back here at 5:00. Oh, and don't forget to take me in your posts. That's fantastic. Yeah, I've always wanted to work with him. I can't do the call right now, but can you set it up before my next rehearsal? Great. Yeah. Awesome. Talk to you later. Bye. Oh! The photos turned out great! I got to post these. Really? Okay, yeah, so she was a bit of a distraction, but I think everyone got a lot out of her advice on how to take the perfect selfie. - Really? - No. - Dylan? - Yeah? Can I come back tomorrow? I just posted these and they've already got, like, a million likes. - Really? - Dylan, I think, for tomorrow, I'll get some shots of me helping the kids, you know? Those type of things really blow up on Instagram. - Oh, and Dylan? - Yeah? I need to get back to my room and meditate, be self-centred. I'm pretty sure you mean centre yourself. Yeah, that one. Good idea. Toodles! Okay, I'll make sure she's not at rehearsal tomorrow. Okay? Hey, and good job with the lines today. Hey, can I let you in on a little trade secret? Go over them in front of a mirror, okay? And match your expressions to the lines. Do you do that? Yeah, all the time. I mean, you look like kind of a knucklehead doing it, but it helps. Thanks, Dylan. Yeah, you got it, pal. Uh. Huh. Where's my phone? Monique... Mo? Hey, Addy, have you heard from Dylan? No. Why? The kids are all in the auditorium, waiting for rehearsal and he's nowhere to be found. He didn't say anything to you? I'll call you back. The last time I saw him, he was in the auditorium, talking to Liam. Weird. Monique? I'll be down in a minute. I think you took my phone. I have an important call to make. Can you just throw down your bag and I'll see if it's in there? - Thank you. - Mm-hm. "Jezebel PR?" "Love Dylan and the kid pics. "Great publicity for you. Keep it going." I thought we were done before. We're doubly done now. Oh, shoot! Dylan, wait. Just don't... I'm sorry, Monique. I just can't be with you anymore. Addy! Well, can I at least come by to get more photos of the kids? Dylan! Addy, wait up. Addy, wait up! What is it, Dylan? - It's not what it looked like. - It doesn't matter. What matters is you blew off rehearsal and you let the kids down. I don't have time for this. If you haven't noticed, I'm treading water here. If you could just bring the play home I'd be happy with that. - I just. - Not now, please. First Christmas together? Got to be a noble fir, and this one's a real beauty. Merry Christmas. You are a born salesman, Garth. Ah, it's easy selling people what they want. Is this where the hot chocolate comes in? Definitely. So, you want to talk about it? I'm not sure. You want another marshmallow? No thank you. Dylan blowing off rehearsal today, I mean, it's so not cool. I don't know what to do. This is usually my favourite time of year, the magic, the hope, the spirit. And instead, I'm pretty sure they're gonna close my school. I'll be out of a job. And Dylan, I... There are times it feels like we're 17 again and it's magic. I just don't even know what to make of it. Well, it may not be my place to say. You can say it. Dylan's eyes light up when he's around you. Monique, not so much. And yet she's with him and no offense, guys, but I'm here, drinking hot chocolate in a Christmas tree shack. Save our school! Make a donation. Merry Christmas. Oh, thank you, sir. Have a candy cane. Save our school! Merry Christmas. What are you doing here? Um, I had some free time, now that I didn't have to direct the play. Little charity work is good for the soul. Am I that much of a curmudgeon? Only an English teacher would use the word "curmudgeon," but, well... I know. "If the shoe fits..." I like it. You think we're gonna make it? Fingers crossed. Toes crossed, too. I just want you to know, you have inspired me, Addison. I was a little burnt out and... You don't say? Thank you for not arguing with me. But you've given me a spark. I'm going to be better. The kids deserve it. And the play's gonna be great. Thanks, Phil. I needed that. You okay? I will be. They're decorating the tree at the town centre. Yeah, I'm not feeling too festive. You? I know. Thank you. You should go. I'll think about it. Don't think about it, just do it. All right, I'll check it out. You do that, Principal Tate. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas, Phil. Save our school! Merry Christmas! Oh, I'm gonna need that recipe for those cookies! They were stupendous! Save our school! Merry Christmas! Make a donation. How are you? Oh, I'm glad you're here. Wouldn't miss it. Wouldn't be Christmas. This is Mission City at its finest. It's tradition. Right up there with the summer cheese toss. Oh! Oh, no. Not a fan. Shouldn't treat dairy products that way. Right. It bruises the cheddar. Exactly. Nice! Okay, it's time! Yeah! Merry Christmas. Hi. I, uh... I kind of brought you a Christmas tree. I can see that. Tell me one good reason why I should let you in. I'll give you three. Go on. Well, one, it's Christmas time. That's a copout. You know I like Christmas and you showed up with a tree. Two, I really need to explain the whole Monique situation. I'm not sure I really want to hear it. Fine, three. I... I actually don't have a three. It just sounded more convincing than two. But, okay, you know what? Three could be that I'm sorry. Okay? I'm sorry for missing rehearsal and I'm sorry for letting you and the kids down. Can you charm your way out of any situation? Yes. It's a noble fir. It's very nice and I already have a stand. I know. And I'm quite particular about the way I do things. Oh, I know. Yeah. Yes. I baked cookies. And you're in luck, I've decided to let you in, but only because I need a tree. Do I get cookies? If you're good. I can live with that. Here I come! A little to the left. How's that? It's good. All right. Don't spill. It's, uh, real hardwood. Right. Extra careful with this. It was my grandmother's. Um. Hm? All right. Here we go. Okay. Anything else while I'm down here? Uh. Well, no. That look good. You can come up. - Lights, huh? - Yep. All right. Oh, no. Ooh. So, about you and Monique. You know what? Forget that I said that. I don't actually want to know. Addy, we're done. Nothing happened between us here. She's toxic. And, you know, more than that, I didn't much like who I was around her. Hey, she accidentally took my phone and I was just trying to get it back 'cause I had an important call with a director about a part, that's it. Oh. Well, that's exciting. What's the part? Well, I don't have it yet. It's just a possibility. Possibilities are good. Yeah, they are. Oh, dear. I'm a rookie. You know what? It's nice having you back here, Dylan. It's nice to be back. It's Judy. It's Garth. - Bat line? - Yeah. Hello? What? When? Yeah. No, I'll call you back. Addy, I'm so sorry. I had no idea she was capable... I'm sorry. When I'm stressed, I revert back to being a second grade teacher. "Hollywood has-been?" "Hometown homewrecker." Mr. Davidson! Mr. Davidson! Well, I guess we made the best of being trapped, huh? Yeah. Got my tree decorated. Good news? Bad news? It's Liam. Three, two, one! Fire! Hey! Yes! More! - This way! - Let's get out of here. So, you kids come up with something or is hiding out in the shack still your best option? I'm not ready to go out there just yet. You hungry? Chinese? What is it? I just got put on administrative leave. I'm so sorry, Addy. It's because of all the negative press. They want me to just take the time off before Christmas. Kind of convenient. What do you mean? He means the school budget review, they don't want me to present. Administrative leave and bam, they just close the school without another word. Call Hans. Who's Hans? He's the shark. I'm on it. We need to get out our version of the events. You know what? We can make a call of our own. Really? Yeah. Hi. This is Addison Tate calling. How would you like an exclusive? Are you ready? Yeah. We'll hit it when the light turns on. Where to start? Um. This social media post misrepresented a small snapshot of a much bigger story. Thanks for coming, guys. I really appreciate it. I hadn't had any contact with Ms. Tate in, what? 20 years? So, when Ms. Tate reached out to my manager, I felt like I had an opportunity to rekindle some old friendships and help out my old school. And my only intention was to save our school, which is on the chopping block due to county-wide budget cuts. Having someone of Dylan's stature would raise awareness and, hopefully, keep us afloat. Reconnecting with Dylan was an obvious plus. As far as Monique's accusations, Ms. Tate and I, we're good friends. Friends. Miss Monteith and I, we broke up some time ago and I thought she had come back to Mission City to try and reconcile, but in reality, she was here to drum up social media interest. Welcome to the age of the internet, right? And how does that make you feel? The important thing is to save our school. -We've started an S.O. -S, as in "Save Our School" site, where we'll be livestreaming our production of It's a Wonderful Elf. Once you donate, you get access to our livestream broadcast of our play. All of the details are available on WMCY News Hawk Five's website. Thank you and have a Merry Christmas. Yes, have a very Merry Christmas. That wasn't half bad. It was hard to tell who the movie star was. Oh, stop it. No, no. Addy, you did great. Talking dog guy dropped out and Gaston really wants you for the part. So, what do I do? This type of part has got, like, awards written all over it. It ups your quote for whatever you want to do next. But, Garth, I mean, I already walked away once and I always regretted it. I'm not gonna do that again. Addy will understand. I know she will, but I can't take this part. This is a good role, Dylan. Now, I haven't told you every... You know what? Just forget about it. What? I've been burning the phone lines for over a year, trying to get you a gig. You never said anything. Well, confidence is a funny thing and I didn't want you to lose yours. So, what about Addy? She's the type of woman you should have been dating for a long time now. I know that now. This opportunity, you can't pass it up. I'd put my foot down and tell you you got to do this, but I'm not like that. All right. I know you're not. We've known each other professionally for 15 years, right? Right. This director is hot and this film is gonna be great and you need to do this. You have to do this. Hey. Hey! You look pretty cute in your work clothes. Well, thanks. So do you. But you're not wearing work clothes. Hey, um, you got a sec? Oh, no. Is it bad news? I just got my Christmas spirit up to an acceptable level. I'd hate to regress. It's good and bad, depending on how you look at it. Okay. You're good to present at the budget review and you should expect a letter of apology from the board. - Really? - Yeah. Thank you. Oh my gosh! Thank you! So, that's, um, that's the good news. What's the bad news? And he said he'd give it up if you wanted him to? Yep. I couldn't ask him to do that, though. That would be crazy! I got nothing. I just hope the kids can pull off the play without him. - The show must go on. - I hope so. He said he'd being watching from Bulgaria. And how are we feeling about him being gone? We had a magic summer when we were seventeen. Now? We have different lives and priorities. I'm happy with that. Happy? Yeah. I've seen the way he looks at you, Addy. Wrapping. Wrapping. With the work you've put in you guys'll be able to pull this off. Hey. No one person is bigger than the production, remember? I mean, directors, actors, producers, they get replaced all the time. You... you don't need me anymore. I can't do it. I'm afraid I'll freeze up there. Hey, you know, you have this quiet confidence that comes across when you perform. It took me ages to figure that out. It did? Heck, yeah. You know, I'm going to try and watch it from Bulgaria. Make sure you're hit your marks. You got this. - Thank you. - Thank you. Did you just smell those? Yeah. They always smell better than they taste. Yeah, fair. You know, I cannot get the smell of those waffles you made out of my head. It's my dad's recipe. Hm. You want to sit? Sure. You know I can't come visit you in Bulgaria right now, right? You've got your review. I just can't think about anything else right now. I saw you the other night, you were decorating the tree. I didn't see you. Ehh, I wanted to let you enjoy your moment and not tie you into my melodrama. Well, thanks. You're practically a human soap opera. I just... I just don't think it's the right time, you know? I'm in flux. I get it. Yeah. I just need things to be a little more settled. Grounded. Something like that. I hope it goes well for you tomorrow. I'll be crossing my fingers for you. Thanks. I'm actually really nervous. I just keep going over all the numbers and the statistics. Addy. You've got this. Okay? Just speak from the heart. I should go. You think they'd open up the terminal for the only flight of the day. Hey, Garth, do you think if I shave my fee, they'd push back the start date of the film? Yeah. I think they'd give you a week for some money off the top. Addy's not answering. Gaston. Yeah, bonjour. It's Garth Turnbull. Listen. We're gonna have to push back Dylan's start date a week. Yeah. We're willing to shave his fee. He wants to know why. Tell him it's about a woman. I mean, he's French, he'll understand. Yeah, um, Dylan's in love. Yeah. No, no, no. It's not Monique. Okay. Okay. I'll see you in a week. Ten days tops! I'll see what I can do. He went for it? Oh, yeah, yeah. He's gonna give you ten days. But he's also wondering if he could get Monique's phone number. I could never do that to him. Yeah, I couldn't help but notice that you didn't so much as flinch when I said that you were in love. You're gonna wear those trees out, you keep moving them back and forth like that. I have to do something to get rid of this nervous energy. Oh, with the review this afternoon? Yeah. Yeah, that and Dylan. Oh? He asked me to go to Bulgaria. And you're not going because? Well, I can't, not with my school in crisis. Yeah. I just hope it goes well today. Thanks. You are my rock. But you're my rock? Can we be each other's rock? Let's do this. Hey. Yeah. Hey, good to see you. This isn't easy for anyone, especially this time of year. So, if there are no objections, I have a few things I'd like to say. I've colour coded my report to emphasize why we should save Mission City Middle School and just how to do that from a budgetary perspective. As principal of Mission City Middle school... Well... I'm just a second grade teacher at heart. I never wanted to be principal, but here we are. I just want you to know... Hey. Uh, was your flight cancelled? I got them to push the film back. I want to finish what I started. So, how'd the hearing go? She was remarkable. But they're still closing the school after the Christmas break. I'm so sorry, Addy. Oh, it's fine. I mean, obviously, it's not, but we just have to make the best of it, I guess. Bye. This a brainstorming session or are we testing to see if we're claustrophobic? Sorry. You know what? I just... I want to donate whatever it's gonna cost to do this. Let me stop you right there, cowboy. You've already done more than I could have hoped for. And he needs the money. I do? What we need to do is figure out how to get five full fiscal years of funding to get the board... On board. How's the S.O.S. fund doing? Quite well, actually, but the play's gonna need to be successful in bringing in some outside cash. Okay, um, why don't we shoot a promo? Get that up on the web? Okay, yeah, yeah, and get the play some traction Yeah. I could get it out to my PR contacts. I can email it to my choir group. And I could make waffles. But seriously, you're gonna make waffles, right? Hi there. I'm Dylan Davidson and I'd like to tell you about my latest project. I'm very proud to be directing the Mission City Middle School Players in our production of It's a Wonderful Elf. Please check out our Save Our School site and for a small donation, you'll be given a link to view the live performance. So, I invite you to come watch our little play, and if you can, please give generously. But, most of all, have yourself a very Merry Christmas. Good afternoon, everyone. As you have no doubt heard, Mission City Middle School is slated to close after the Christmas break. We've started a Save Our School site with a link to our live streaming broadcast of our play once you've donated. What we need is for you to get those fingers going, to post and re-post the site links to all of your social media accounts, all of your contacts and get them to do the same. If we want to keep our school open, we need this to go viral in a big way. Let's burn up the internet! That was good, some of your best work. I'm proud of you. I just hope it works. Me, too. The commute'll kill me. Hey. How long have you been standing there? Oh, long enough to see you're enjoying yourself. I am. And the kids are stoked and so am I. I just keep thinking what if it doesn't work? We're staging a Christmas play at Christmas. Most of the Midwest just got hit by snow. We're gonna have great numbers, Addy. This... this has been the strangest couple of weeks in my entire life. Whatever happens, I just want you to know that I really appreciate everything you've done. I, um... I had a lot of making up to do. Thank you so much for coming. Thanks. Hi. How are you? - Hey. - Hey. Liam's missing in action. What? What do you mean? He had a real rough time in dress rehearsal. So, he's around here somewhere in costume. Can you find him and talk to him? He's done such an amazing job, and I don't want to him to miss it and destroy the play in the process. Sure. I'll go look. Thank you. Have you seen Addy? Uh, no. Have you seen this? Liam, are you okay? Liam? Liam. Nerves? Do you want to go on tonight? No problem. I mean, it'll be a shame because Dylan says you've been doing really great. You just have to take this next step. I know it's a lot to put on your plate, but you're going to help us save the school. I am? You are, by going on. And I'm betting on you being great. I just know it. Look how far you've come already. At the beginning of the year, did you think that you'd lead a snowball fight rescue mission? That was pretty cool. Way cool. What do you say? How about you get out there and act your socks off? Thanks for believing in me, Ms. Tate. Come on, Liam. You got it, buddy. Christmas, a time for giving, for family and for joy. It's the time of year that brings out the best in all of us. But most of all, it's time for Santa Claus! No problem. We've created a monster. Nobody'll notice the arm. Santa's not coming? But why? How will the children feel? Was that in the script? No, but it's better. He's a natural. Christmas is saved. Ho, ho, ho! I found him! Get to work, you goofballs. You, get the sleigh. Santa's gonna have to lose some weight. Come on, guys. We got a lot of work to do. On Dasher! On Dancer! On Prancer! Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas! Dylan! Dylan! Dylan! Dylan! Oh, come on, stop it. Enough You guys, I mean. Look, thank you all for coming and supporting our kids, your kids, and for all of those watching at home, for helping our school. I just wanna say how proud I am of all the work that these kids have put in. Great performances all the way around. But none of this would have been possible without Mission City Middle School Principal Addison Tate. Come on, Addy, take a bow! Addy! Addy! Addy! Addy! Addy! Addy! Whoo! Thank you all so much for being here tonight. Whether you're at home livestreaming this on the internet or here in the auditorium, we appreciate you're support so much. I just wanna take this opportunity to thank Dylan Davison, who took time out of his busy schedule and flew all the way here from Los Angeles to help us bring this play home. He did that out of his love for Mission City and out of his love for this school, and for that, we are very grateful. Unfortunately, it's with a heavy heart that I have to tell you all we didn't quite make it. But you should all be so proud of the fight that we've put up over the last few weeks. Christmas is bigger than all of this, so let's remember that as we go home and spend the holidays with our loved ones. May I? Sure. Can we get a round of applause for Addison Tate? Hello, Mission City Middle School, parents and supporters. My name's Garth Turnbull, Dylan Davidson's manager for many, many, years, and with the help of the audio visual club, I would like to show you what's trending number one on the internet, and I'm not talking cat videos. Roll! I'm just a second grade teacher at heart. I never wanted to be a principal... You get used to it. But here I am. I just want you to know that this town needs this old school. Mission City Middle School has an outstanding record of academic achievement. It's served this county's children well for more than 63 years, and that is because of the dedication of the teachers, the support staff, the parents and the surrounding community. Generations of our children have passed through and they've gone on to become valuable members of our community. Some of them even grew up to be movie stars. We can do better. We can find a way. We... We have to find a way. I urge you to reconsider. This town needs this school. It's the lifeblood of our community. This school is us. How can you take away part of us? How can you take away that from these kids? Thank you and I hope you all have a Merry Christmas. That heartfelt speech has gone viral and has been re-posted four million times. What? Can we switch over to our Save Our School site? Thank you so much. Thank you. No, thank you, Addy. You know the reason I never said goodbye when I left? If I'd seen you, I never could have gone. And I probably wouldn't have let you go. I've wanted to do that since I was seventeen. Well, took you long enough. Man, I love you, Addison Tate, I always have. I love you too, Dylan Davidson. You've always been my dream. I mean, even before you were, like, everyone else's dream. Okay, you know, I've never actually carved one of these things before. Oh, you really are just a pretty face. Oh, and if you need a hand, I've got one. Okay. You know what? I'm just going to just hack my way though it. As long as I get my cut. Fine. You can have 10% of my piece. Thank you. Remember that guest spot I did where I played a doctor? - Oh my gosh. - Yeah. I was faking it then, too. I'm not really one, but I play one on television. Are you gonna be able to do that on your own? I think I can probably do it. Does that look right? Thank you. This looks so good, Addy. To Addy. Aww. To Addy. Cheers. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. Cheers. Mm. Mm! Let's dig in. So good. It's good. Get some more on your plate. So yummy. Sink okay? Yeah, yeah. Just put them there. Listen, um, you still haven't told me if you're coming to Bulgaria. Oh. Well, I wanted it to be a surprise. I didn't have time to get you anything for Christmas. Are you kidding me? You... You've given me everything I ever needed. Merry Christmas, Addy. Merry Christmas. Are those pies ready? We can't forget the pies. - No. Hey. - Yeah? Serious question, are you a pie a la mode person? Well, that depends. I mean, apple, yes. Pumpkin, no. I prefer whip cream with pumpkin, doesn't overpower the nutmeg. You are quite a complex person. You don't even know the half of it. Hey, wait, um, we are having waffles tomorrow, right? - Of course. - Okay. Look at that.
