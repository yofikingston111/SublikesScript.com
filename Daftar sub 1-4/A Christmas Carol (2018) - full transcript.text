Hurry up! We can be five minutes late on Christmas Eve. Come on! You're late. We um... We had to drop the children off at the carol service for the orphanage. We were... This is Steve and Sarah Smale, sir. Have they been late before? This is their second time, sir. The first time our son he wasn't very well, so we had to take to the doctor's. You're fired. But... But? But it was only five minutes. Only five minutes? Do you think it's fair to not pay a man who works for a month, Mr. Smale? No. No. The correct answer. I employ 2504 people. If each of them were to take five minutes off work each year, that's the equivalent of 209 hours roughly lost to tardiness. Now, I pay both of you a very generous minimum wage of seven pounds an hour. That equates to 1463 pounds. If you were to do this twice a year, that's over 3000 pounds which is almost double both of your salaries. To cover the deficit of everyone doing this, I would essentially have to not pay two workers a month's salary, which as you correctly put, is not fair. To prevent this from happening, I need to set an example. You're the example. You're fired! Good day. I want the rota from yesterday. Faster! Today's profits are looking exceedingly good, sir. I believe we'll be making our largest profit to date. Believe? We will be, sir. Definitely. Good. Do we know how many workers we can lay off yet with this new automated machinery we've got coming in from Germany? I believe we'll be letting 500 staff go, sir. Perfect. Send out the letters tomorrow. Tomorrow is Christmas, sir. And? No reason. Actually... Yes? The Christmas bonus checks should be filed. Christmas bonus? Yes, sir. When we hit targets, the staff are entitled to a 100-pound bonus. Bah, humbug. Ah, there you are! Merry Christmas, nephew! Mmm. And a very Merry Christmas to you, Bob. Merry Christmas, Fred. I'll leave you two to it. No, no, no, no wait a minute. How's the family? They're well, thank you. Good, good. And your husband, Tim? He's coping. He's a fighter. He'll pull through. We hope so. Well, you say Merry Christmas to all your family for me, won't you? I shall, thank you. Ah, working on Christmas Eve, Ebenezer? Was there a reason why I shouldn't? You can do what you like, but your employees? Christmas Day, they get Christmas Day off. And a fine excuse it is to pick a man's pocket every 25th of December. You know once upon a time, I used to admire your drive. And what now? Jealous of it? Millions and millions to be jealous of you mean? Indeed. No. You used to make the most out of every day. Now it seems like the day makes the most out of you. Bah, humbug. Come on, prove me wrong. Come and have Christmas dinner with me. I've got a great big turkey fat enough to feed an army. Maybe, dare I say it, bring a lady friend with you. You may enjoy wasting your days, Uncle, but I do not. Tomorrow is as good a day as any to work. Good day, Uncle. Ah, just as I expected. If you expected it, then why bother coming over here? Wasteful in more ways than one, you are, sir. As your uncle, I felt it my duty to come and wish you Merry Christmas. I am your last living relative. Congratulations on not dying. Oh! Merry Christmas, nephew. Bah, humbug. A no means... Well, I'm Charity and this is... Grace, and we're collecting for the British Heart Foundation this Christmas. Now, we're only asking for a donation as big, - or as generous... - Are there not charities that already take care of the poor and needy? Well, yes. And the welfare state and the NHS which my taxes go for? Well yes, but it's not enough. I mean, people are dying. If they're already dying, why not let them do so and decrease the surplus population? What? Eh, ah, a bit of money towards some arsenic perhaps? Or maybe a cattle prod? That'll give them a nice little buzz, wouldn't it? No! Leave me alone. Leave me alone! Was that your idea of a joke, sending them in? Actually it was your Uncle Fred's, sir. Bring them back. What? Bring them back. Come in, come in, come in. I'm sorry about earlier. I've changed my mind. I'd like to make a donation. Well, great. How much should we put you down for? 250,200 pounds. No need to be so surprised. It's all in a good cause. Uh well, um, thank you, thank you, sir. I don't believe it. You're helping a good cause? Believe it. I've just made us an even bigger profit. I don't follow. Christmas bonuses? I've just donated them to charity. We'll be able to write them off against tax. You just gave away everybody's Christmas bonus? Very noble of them, isn't it? And that's the end of the day. What a way to end it. Eh, charity! Boom, I love it! See you tomorrow, Cratchett. I have the day off tomorrow, sir. Yes. Well, come in all the earlier the next day. Yes, sir. Hi. Hi, Carol. You look good. It's designer. Of course. Evidently. Don't be mean. Don't be ignorant. Wow, you've changed. Yes, I do daily. Helps to keep the clothes clean. I was wandering if I could get a lift? Home? Sure, I mean, I don't have any plans for tomorrow. How wasteful. I thought we could reminisce about the good times. These are the good times. I'm richer than ever. Merry Christmas. Do you not want a lift? It'd be five minutes out your way to drop me home. Can give me some money for petrol? I'll take the bus. Good decision, finally. Finally. Drive. Hey. Are the kids back from school yet? No, not yet, they've got carol service. Yeah, nearly forgot. You look beautiful. Thank you. So do you. You are a terrible liar. How you feeling? Sore. But I was watching the kids playing in the snow earlier. That was nice. Then I hade a sleep. I'm fine. You know you'll be out there joining them soon. That's a thought. It's not a thought, it's a promise. A promise. Ah. Well, would you look at this, Bob? Some strangers have blown in from outside! We're not strangers! We're your kids. Mmm, you can't be my kids. My kids are supposed to be outside singing carols. We have been singing carols! Mmm, prove it. I think that's a really good idea. They look familiar. Mmm hmm. Prove it. Okay. One, two, three. ♪ We wish you a Merry Christmas ♪ ♪ We wish you a Merry Christmas ♪ ♪ And a Happy New Year ♪ Good tidings we bring ♪ To you and your kin ♪ We wish you a Merry Christmas ♪ ♪ And a Happy New Year We did Christmas wishes today at school, Dad. Oh, aye? I wished that you'd get better. Me too. I didn't. I know you'll get better. I wished for chocolate cake! This isn't really my scene. Come on, we'll have fun, I promise. Come on, let's go and sit done. Come on. Come on. So, did you have fun? Maybe. Did you have fun? Maybe. I knew you would. Come on, walk me home. Is that you reminiscing about the old times, Eby? Did you say something? Uh, no, sir. Looks beautiful, doesn't it. Did you hear that? Uh, excuse me, sir. Truly marvelous. Nice car, looks comfy. It's not a very nice day, is it? Odd. But look at the view. Look outside. Truly marvelous. I'm hearing things. Bah, humbug. Ebenezer, Eby! Ebenezer. Are you listening? Stop! - Ebenezer. - Where are you? Huh? Checking the boot. Very cliche. Indeed. What the... Where are you? Reveal yourself! We used to say we would get into the whiskey business so we could have something decent to drink and could enjoy the view. Marley? No, no, no, no, no, no, this can't be! This can't be! You're dead, dead! That's not nice. Dead! Nice. Something's wrong. You, you, shouldn't be here. This isn't happening. Boo! Now, now, behave. It's been a while since I've been here and I think you should treat me to a drive. Not a chance. In a car wreck, you watched my body shudder and burn. Time for me to have my turn. Sit there and do as I say, so for you this might end a different way. Ask him to drive. Drive. Manors Eby. Please. Good boy. Do you remember? How could I forget? So many good times. Many. When was the last time you came here? I don't have time for such frivolities now. No such time? You left me up to my ears in work! When you left I had to be strong. When you left I had to work hard. Day, night, day, night, day! When you left! I didn't leave you, Eby. I just died. You left! And I had to pick up the pieces! I couldn't be weak! I had to be strong, hard! Up to my ears! So I'm your excuse then, Eby. Excuses are for the weak. Oh, you're so strong, Eby. I'm rich! And it's Ebenezer Scrooge, Mr. Scrooge to you. Well, well, well. Tonight, when the clock strikes one, the first of three spirits shall come and visit. Oh, how poor you've become, Mr. Scrooge. Marley? Marley? Come back. Come back here now! Ebenezer? Bah, humbug! Bah! Tonight, when the clock strikes one, the first of three spirits shall come and visit. Tick tock, tick. I was never a good man, Mr. Scrooge. And we both know that I am chained to my past. But you, you always had that kindness. You can escape the same fate. Find that kindness again. Tick tock, Ebenezer. I'm losing my senses. Easily done, easily done. Smallest thing can affect them. Slight irritation of the stomach. Bit of undigested beef, blob of mustard, bit of cheese. Marley. It's more of gravy than grave about him tonight! Bah! Humbug! Sleep well? What the... What? No, who. Who? I'm the ghost of Christmas past. Bah, humbug. You're... The ghost of Christmas past. How did you get in? The same way we'll get out. Get out? Surely if you've come to see me, you weren't planning on leaving so soon. We've a lot of work to do. That we do. So we should go. The doors are locked. We're not leaving by the doors. How then? Same way I got in. I'll humor you, go on. My old school. You remember this place? Well. Today was a sad day. Why did you bring me here? What is this? This is your past. I'm here to make you remember. Some things are best forgotten. Ebenezer. Could you come with me? Recognize yourself? Ebenezer. You remember this moment? There's been an accident. I will never forget it. But your uncle's coming to get you. Your parents, they've been involved in a car crash. I don't need to see this. What nightmare is this you curse me with? His parents died in a car crash. Poor thing. Poor thing? I'm not poor! I'm not poor! I'm rich! What the... Spirit? Ghost! I'm here. Where? All around. I am the past. Look. Nell. She's very pretty. Yes she was. What's the difference between snowmen and snowladies? I have no idea. Snowballs. She always knew how to make me laugh. You can't kiss me until you tell me a fact. Uh, okay, um, the Lydians of Turkey were the first to use gold and silver coins. Wait, not about money! Is that what you woo me with? Okay. The Greeks identified four forms of love: kinship, friendship, divine, and this is the last one. Is that so? We didn't spend Christmas here. We drove to her parents'. My last family Christmas. Bah. Humbug. But nicely grilled. Cheers. Welcome and Merry Christmas to everybody. Everyone was so happy. It's lovely to finally meet you. To leave the room, she'd have to go and get... And then rabbit stew. Were you happy? For once, yes. And then it changed. Can we stay a little longer? We can't go on like this. We couldn't. You work all day and all night. Is this all life is to you? If you think it's all fun and games out there in the real world, you need to grow up. I work hard and you should follow suit! Follow suit? Sic-God, you have no idea, do you? Oh, I have ideas, big ideas. Look, when I'm rich and you're poor, you'll realize who was right. Quite right. When I'm... You're such a piece of work. I like to think so. You know, when we met, I found your financial obsessions amusing, almost cute. Yeah, charmingly cute. But now day after day, week after week, month after month, year after year your heart it's just grown cold and my feelings with it. Nell, that's not true. My heart is on fire. Yeah, it's your desire. Let me prove it. Okay, say you'll be poor and happy as long as you're with me. That would be foolish. You can't, can you? You act as though life's one big fairy tale? Isn't that what life is supposed to be? You're being foolish. If I'm so foolish, then why do we dream? Why do our imaginations run wild and our hearts skip beats? Isn't that what life is supposed to be? You know, when a poor man's heart skips a beat, he dies. Yeah, and my starved heart's done with you. We're over. I actually thought that you, never mind. She died a year later. I heard. And those were your last words. And it holds many Christmas memories for you. The past is the past. Must you torment me with the painful ones? Well? Better. Was this a good Christmas? Yes. Marley always knew how to bring out the best in me. If you just work it really hard, we're gonna get it. How we lookin'? Yeah, remember to add the hours. Yeah, just put it there. This could actually work. Gentleman, a very Merry Christmas! Fezziwig. Fezziwig, sir! Very Merry Christmas to you too! Scrooge, would you look who it is? Gentlemen, we have quite a party planned. What on Earth are you working on? Crunching some numbers. He's workin' it. Almost finished. And he'll be there... Done! Boom, get this man a beer! I'm good actually, I'm good honestly, thank you. You work hard, you play hard, you work harder, and you play harder. Relax boys the night is still young and will, you have my word, be long. Like none other. Find you in here working again? I'm just finishing off a couple of things. Hey, Eby. Oh, he's coming this instant. Come on. I... Remember these moments and enjoy them to the fullest. Once they're gone, you'll never be able to come back again. Seize the day. All right. I'm not a dancer. Yeah, I noticed. This is a cool place. So what do you guys do? We run an online distillery. You can mix your own whiskey online and then order it through Marley and me. Sounds like fun. It is! Well, you were wrong. We have to use a sherry casque if we want to get a richer flavor. Look, it's not a case of... Fiona! You're late! Five minutes. Has it happened before? Maybe once. I've been late once, but... No buts! Work hard, work hard. Work, work, work, work. Every minute counts. Crunch the figures, Eby. Five minutes, twice a year. With 30 employees at $6 an hour. $30 a year. That's five hours of someone's day, unpaid. It's not fair is it? No, but I... No buts. You're fired! How can you just... I've worked hard for you guys. There have been days when I've worked five minutes longer. And there's been some days where I've had to put up with mediocrity. Tardiness is something we don't deal with. It 'tis a bit harsh. Someone not being paid for a day's work, that's not just harsh, but unfair. Are you an unfair employer? I'm always fair. Ebenezer, please. He's right. I have rent to pay? So do we. You're fired! Business is booming, demands are through the roof. We need to think about setting up our new international base in Scotland. Oh you're kidding? Why? It will be the base for all the international operations. We went over this. It makes fiscal sense. It's cold and rainy. What about LA or the Bahamas? Nowhere has the financial incentives that Scotland has. My memories of home aren't completely joyful to me. We're going. There's nothing worth living for for me over there. But plenty of worth to make it worthy of our while. I'm gonna take some convincing. They have whiskey. I convinced him to go. This is our last stop. Why do you insist on torturing me with visions such as this, these awful memories? They are what they are. Those are Marley's ashes. He died shortly after we returned here. And you were alone. Alone again. 2:00. Time for another... Ah! Ha! Who are you? I am the Goose of Christmas Present. The goose? Nickname, because I love a good stuffing! Oh look at me go. I shouldn't be sharing my secrets with the likes of you. Hmm, I can see you're a slippery little thing, aren't you? Face like a trout and a body with which I would just leave the bones. Oh, look at me getting all in a flap. What day is it? Hmm, Christmas Day, obviously. Christmas Day. I hate it. You don't experience it. You don't feel it. You can't hate it. Ask the previous spirit. I don't live in the past. I live in the here, the now, the present. Well come on then, tell me what there is for me to be excited about, how to make myself happy. Why I should enjoy the day? Because that's what all this is about isn't it? Me, myself, and I. What? That's what you just said. Show me. Make myself. Why I should. And? Today isn't about you. Choose someone, anyone. And you'll see the spirit of Christmas. Bah, humbug. Anyone. We'll follow them. And you'll see what it means for Christmas, what it really means. It's a happy, wonderful time. What do any of these people have to be happy about? Then choose any, any one person. I choose him. A wonderful choice. Reginald Thompson. He's had a tough year. A scrounger, eh? He was laid off in April. He's had to make ends meet since then. He had to move to a run down apartment. There the cold gave him back problems and made it hard for him to find suitable work. Lazy. What's he got to be happy about? Picking up pennies, pathetic. Come. What are you doing? Dancing. The Goose Step. Do you know, sometimes I just can't help myself. Must be the Christmas Spirit in me. - Come on, you try it. - Never. Why are we here? This is the house of two of your former employees, Mr. and Mrs. Smale. Their children are part of the Christmas choir. That's their youngest in the window. What's she waiting for? A horse. She asked for one for Christmas. An expensive gift. What's he doing? He helps with the running of the choir. Keeps him busy. Bah. And he knows all about her Christmas wish. He can barely afford to stay alive let alone afford a horse. The Cratchetts. Dinner will be awhile. It's not much. It smells delicious! Dad, what's your Christmas wish? Oh, I don't need a Christmas wish. I have everything I could ever wish for right here. What's wrong with him? Cancer. He's dying. I bet you wish you could hear us sing? The whole choir! That would be wonderful. And when I have the strength again, I'll come. What's that? Come over and see! He can't afford this. It's ludicrous. The whole community had heard about poor Reggie's penny hunting. So they all decided to chip in and make Mr. and Mrs. Smale's daughter's wish come true. You know they even told him to keep his pennies. Do you think Reg could stay for dinner? Well, we don't have much, but I'm sure we can make room for one more, eh. Got something in your eye there? It's the cold wind. There's plenty more of that to come. This is a wonderful way to work off such a delicious Christmas dinner. Aye, it's a family tradition, you know! But no Ebenezer? The last time he did this walk with me, the pair of you were still at school together and he was still living with me. How long did he live with you? Oh, from the age of 14 to 18. And then he began to turn into the monster he is today. Oh now, he's not a monster. How 'bout tyrant then? If he were an animal, he'd most likely be the cross between a bull and a vulture, the talons of one and the fury of the other. But crossed with a crow, picking up all the shinies for his own. With a mouth like a dragon to boot! Now, now, come on. He's not that bad. I mean, I know he can be a wee bit brash, and he is a bit mean. Well, he does love money more than anything. Ah, he just lacks... Compassion? Love? Kindness? A heart? Carol, you don't really mean that. No, growing up he was always friendly and kind. But, if you asked him for a favor, what would he say? What's in it for me? Some help? Helps for fools. Dare I say charity? Have a cattle rod instead! He's mean, selfish, and a bully. He'd rather do a hundred things for himself than one to help another. Is that really what they think of me? Mmm, all I show you is the present, all that it is. Do not look so sad, Fred, for you are kind and generous and you know the true meaning of Christmas. Christmas pudding everyone? Exactly! Everybody back - for Christmas pudding! - Yes please. Come on now. You can bet if they're having Christmas pudding I am too. Is this what you wanted to be when you grew up, huh? I can change. I went to the best schools, I made money, I employed lots of people I have much, much to show for who I am, hmm. But... Oh, oh no. Another spirit? Hurry up and show yourself and let's make this quick. Patience. Suicide, suicide, suicide, suicide. Suicide, suicide. Suicide, suicide. You're the spirit of Christmas yet to come, aren't you? Yes. Shall I follow? Shall I follow? Yes. Now! Mom said everyone was laughing and pretending they'd share out his belongings for this year's Christmas bonus. His bed sheets are probably worth more than my dad's car. He'd need thick sheets to warm his cold heart up. His death is the best Christmas present ever. Good riddance everyone says. At least he'll have friends now. Yeah, the worms! Spirit, what poor wretch is this they speak of? Sit. His death is the best Christmas present ever. His death is the best Christmas present ever. His death is the best Christmas present ever. Cratchetts. Can we sing you a carol? In a minute, dear. Please? Sure. Go and get your brother and sister. It'll be just like when dad was here. I promise. Get your brother and sister. He died didn't he, Tim Cratchett? Yes. That can't have been who they were talking about at the school, can it? Spirit? Silence. Here again? Yes. Spirit! Dare I ask, who was the man the children spoke of so gleefully when he passed? What poor wretch was that? Please, I must know. - Tombstone. - I need to know. Stop! Ah! Please, tell me. If this is what's to come, can it be changed? Please. I must know. Tombstone! No, please, please, no. Answer me this, can this be changed? All you spirits have shown me, I understand it now. Tell me this can be changed. Where have you gone? A man can change. Please. Please tell me. I swear I shall live with the Christmas spirit inside me from this day till the next! I understand now. I swear, I will live with it every day. A man can change! A man can change. I can change! I'm alive. I'm alive. And I'm, I'm here. I'm home. What day is it? Welcome back to the show. It is Christmas morning. Christmas! I haven't missed it! Yes! Oh! It's so good to be alive. I feel, I feel, I feel like doing the goose step! I'm ridiculous! I don't care, I don't care. Oh it's good to be alive! To be with your loved ones. We certainly hope you got home safely and that you're all under one roof enjoying each other's company. Now, if you're anything like my family, you'll most likely be pulling the hair off each other within a couple of days. But what's Christmas without tradition, eh? We certainly hope you enjoy your day, folks. Merry Christmas! No, no, no, no, no, no. You can't work, it's Christmas Day. Take the day off. In fact, take the week off, the month. No, not the month, the week. Take the week off. Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! And a very Merry Christmas to you, sir! And a Merry Christmas to you too! Ah, there's two of you! Eh, no. Just one of each of us. But not two of the same person. That would be impossible. Not as impossible as you may think! I have actually been in the same room as I have been in it watching myself! No! That would mess with the space time continuum. Exactly. And you don't wanna mess with that. Tricky thing. Well, yes, as that may be. Tricky thing. You're working on Christmas day? Gotta make ends meet. You must take the day off, you must! Easy for you to say. Easy to say for anyone. Harder to do. Not necessarily hard. Too strong a word? Easy for you both to say. You've sold everything. Excuse me? I'm buying every cake, every single one. I'm buying it all, every last cake. God bless you, sir. Eh, I'm not entirely sure we can let you buy everything. Health and safety. Ah, yeah. You might explode. Exactly! They're not all for me and I insist. It's my Christmas wish. All that I ask is that you deliver them to an address for me. That's Cratchett's house. Ah. It's on the way home, of course! If you could deliver it within the hour, your timing would be perfect. Then I shall make it so. Make it shall we so. Just send the invoice to the distillery. Ah! I knew this was too good to be true. The owner of that place won't pay for this. I've heard he won't even pay for... The Christmas bonuses! I almost forgot. I'll make sure they're paid tomorrow. No chance, that Scrooge is a... He's me. And yes, yes, yes, yes, he wasn't a very nice person, a terrible person in fact, a tyrant. He was rotten and rude. But he's changing, here, now, today, this, with you and a Merry Christmas. It's gonna take a while to add up. Well, uh, how 'bout I just pay you um, that. That's way too much. You can't accept... It's a Christmas bonus. Merry Christmas! Mr. Scrooge? You weren't at work today, Bob Cratchett. No sir, it's Christmas Day. That it is. And do you think I, Ebenezer Scrooge, would give you the day off? Well, yes, sir. We discussed it. Did we now? You're fired. And rehired, at double the salary. I don't know what... And I'm going to pay off your mortgage as a starting bonus. Mom! Um, yeah, well I... I say yes, is what I believe you're trying to say. I say yes? And a Merry Christmas to you too! In fact all of you, I hear you're very good singers. Bless you all and Merry Christmas. There are gonna be some changes around here, Bob. I want to see more happiness, more smiles, and more fun in the work place. In fact, in every place! Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas. He's not as bad as you said, Mom. I guess not. He's got the Christmas spirit. Ah. What do you want? To wish you a Merry Christmas and, and apologize. I was not quite myself the other day and in a foul mood. I would like to beg forgiveness and offer you your jobs back, with a pay rise. A pay rise? Everyone's getting a pay rise and their bonuses. Well, we... We'll take it. Apology accepted. Marvelous! Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! And if you see your children's choir teacher tell him to come see me as well. I have a job for him, a very good one. I think he's lost his mind. Or got it back at last. Merry Christmas. Ebenezer? I hoped I might catch you. Catch me? But how do you know where I'm going? I, um, how long have we known each other? Uh, since we were kids. And we've had some good times? Had. We did, we did, and I want more good times, with you. If you'll have me. If you'll humor me. What's got into you? The Christmas spirit. Really? Yes, completely. I've missed too many Christmases and not another starting today at Fred's if that's where you're going. Yeah but how did you know that? Ask no questions, get no incredible answers. Come on, let's not waste another moment! Okay! Hay, just getting the horse ready. Here's the, give these pennies... No, no, no, no, no. This is free, Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. A gift for me? A gift for you. I haven't been given a Christmas gift in a while. I don't think I've seen you so happy for quite a while. Now drive on, we musn't be late! Late for Christmas? Never again.
