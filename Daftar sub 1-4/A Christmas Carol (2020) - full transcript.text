[INDISTINCT CROWD CHATTER] [CHURCH BELL TOLLS] Is he the bad one? Very bad. And are there ghosts? [GIRL 1]: What are the people in the picture? [GIRL 2]: They're in prison. [GIRL 1]: They look sad. Say we're nearly ready. [INDISTINCT CHILDREN'S VOICES] [MAN]: Ghosts, you say? Are you quite certain you won't be too... frightened! No, Father. Don't be silly. It's a nice story. It's only Marley who's slightly unpleasant... and he's soon gone. Oh, Marley was dead to begin with. There is no doubt whatever about that. Old Marley was dead as a door-nail. Did Scrooge know Marley was dead? Of course he did! Scrooge and Marley had been partners for... I don't know how long. He was his sole executor, his sole mourner. And even Scrooge was not so desperately cut up about the sad event. There is no doubt about that. This must be clearly understood or nothing good can come of this story that I am about to relate. [LIGHTS CLUNK] [NARRATOR]: Oh, but Scrooge was a tight-fisted hand at the grindstone. Scrooge! A squeezing, wrenching, grasping scraping, clutching, covetous old sinner! Hard and sharp as flint from which no steel had ever struck out generous fire. Secret, and self-contained and solitary as an oyster. Once upon a time of all the good days in the year, on Christmas Eve old Scrooge sat busy in his counting house. [DOOR SLAMS] - [CHURCH BELL CHIMES] - [INDISTINCT CHATTER] It was cold, bleak, biting weather. The door of Scrooge's counting house was open that he might keep his eye upon his clerk who, in a dismal little cell beyond was copying letters. Scrooge had a very small fire. The clerk tried to warm himself at the candle in which effort, not being a man of strong imagination he failed. [FRED]: A merry Christmas, Uncle! [NARRATOR]: Cried a cheerful voice. God save you! [NARRATOR]: It was the voice of his nephew, Fred who came upon him so quickly that this was the first intimation he had of his approach. [SCROOGE]: Bah, humbug! [FRED]: Christmas a humbug, Uncle? You don't mean that, I'm sure. [SCROOGE]: I do. What right have you to be merry? You're poor enough. [FRED]: Come then, what right have you to be dismal? What reason have you to be morose? You're rich enough. [SCROOGE]: Bah, humbug! [FRED]: Don't be cross, Uncle! [SCROOGE]: What else can I be when I live in such a world of fools as this? What's Christmas time to you but a time for paying bills without money? A time for finding yourself a year older but not an hour richer. If I could work my will every idiot who goes about with "Merry Christmas" on his lips should be boiled with his own pudding and buried with a stake of holly through his heart. [FRED]: Uncle! I have always thought of Christmas time as a good time. A kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time. The only time I know of in the long calendar of the year when men and women seem by one consent to open their shut-up hearts freely and to think of people below them as if they really were fellow passengers to the grave and not another race of creatures bound on other journeys. And therefore, Uncle though it has never put a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket I believe that it has done me good and will do me good and I say, God bless it! [NARRATOR]: The clerk involuntarily applauded becoming immediately sensible of the impropriety. [SCROOGE]: Let me hear another sound from you and you'll keep your Christmas by losing your situation. [FRED]: Don't be angry, Uncle. Come! Dine with us tomorrow. [SCROOGE]: Thank you, but no. [FRED]: But why? Why? [SCROOGE]: Why did you get married? [FRED]: Because I fell in love. [SCROOGE]: Because you fell in love! Good afternoon. [FRED]: I want nothing from you, I ask nothing of you. Why cannot we be friends? [SCROOGE]: Good afternoon. [FRED]: I am sorry, with all my heart to find you so resolute. We have never had any quarrel to which I have been a party. But I have made the trial in homage to Christmas and I'll keep my Christmas honour to the last. So a merry Christmas, Uncle! - Happy New Year! - Good afternoon. Good afternoon. [NARRATOR]: His nephew left without an angry word, notwithstanding. He stopped at the outer door to bestow the greetings of the season on the clerk, who, cold as he was was warmer than Scrooge for he returned them cordially. [SCROOGE]: There's another fellow, my clerk with 15 shillings a week, and a wife and family talking about a merry Christmas. I'll retire to a madhouse. He'll want all day tomorrow, I suppose. [CRATCHIT]: If quite convenient, sir. [SCROOGE]: It's not convenient, and it's not fair. If I was to stop half-a-crown for it you'd think yourself ill-used, I'll be bound? You don't think me ill-used, when I pay a day's wages for no work. [CRATCHIT]: It is only once a year, sir. [SCROOGE]: A poor excuse for picking a man's pocket every 25th of December! But I suppose you must have the whole day. Be here all the earlier next morning. [NARRATOR]: The clerk promised that he would and Scrooge walked out with a growl. The office was closed in a twinkling and the clerk ran home to Camden Town as hard as he could pelt, to play at blind man's-buff. [CHILDREN GIGGLE] As Scrooge left his counting house he was approached by two gentlemen who had been on their way to visit him. [MAN 1]: Scrooge and Marley's, I believe. Have I the pleasure of addressing Mr Scrooge - or Mr Marley? - Mr Marley has been dead these seven years. He died seven years ago, this very night. [MAN 1]: We have no doubt his liberality is well represented by his surviving partner. [SCROOGE]: Good afternoon. [MAN 2]: At this festive season of the year it is more than usually desirable that we should make some slight provision for the poor and destitute who suffer greatly at the present time. [BOY]: Take pity on us, sir. We've got no lodgings. [MAN 2]: Many thousands are in want of common necessaries hundreds of thousands are in want of common comforts, sir. [SCROOGE]: Are there no prisons? [MAN 1]: Plenty of prisons. [SCROOGE]: And the Union workhouses? Are they still in operation? [MAN 1]: They are. I wish I could say they were not. [SCROOGE]: The Treadmill and the Poor Law are in full vigour then? [MAN 2]: Both very busy, sir. [SCROOGE]: Oh. I was afraid, from what you said at first that something had occurred to stop them in their useful course. I'm very glad to hear it. [MAN 1]: Under the impression that they scarcely furnish Christian cheer of mind or body to the multitude a few of us are endeavouring to raise a fund to buy the poor some meat and drink and means of warmth. We choose this time, because it is a time of all others, when want is keenly felt and abundance rejoices. What shall I put you down for? [SCROOGE]: Nothing! [MAN 2]: You wish to be anonymous? [SCROOGE]: I wish to be left alone since you ask me what I wish, gentlemen, that is my answer. I don't make merry myself at Christmas and I can't afford to make idle people merry. I help to support the establishments I have mentioned they cost enough, and those who are badly off must go there. [MAN 2]: Many can't go there and many would rather die. [MANAGER]: The missus goes that way, you that way. No argument, mind. [SCROOGE]: If they would rather die they had better do it and decrease the surplus population. Besides, it's not my business. It's enough for a man to understand his own business and not to interfere with other people's. Mine occupies me constantly. Good afternoon, gentlemen. [RAUCOUS CHATTER] [OVERSEER]: Hurry along, there! No talking. [CROWD CLAMOURS] [OVERSEER]: Eyes to the front! [CROWD CHATTER FADES] [LOUD LAUGHTER] [MAN]: Another gin, waiter! [CUPS CLINK] [MAN 2]: Finished with the paper? [NARRATOR]: Scrooge took his melancholy dinner in his usual melancholy tavern and having read all the newspapers went home to bed. [BEGGAR]: Charity? It's Christmas, guv. [NARRATOR]: Let any man explain to me if he can how it happened that Scrooge having his key in the lock of the door saw in the knocker Marley's face. Marley's face... It had a dismal light about it like a bad lobster in a dark cellar. That, and its livid colour made it horrible. As Scrooge looked fixedly at this phenomenon it was a knocker again. [GHOSTLY CHIME] [BELLS RING] The bells ceased as they had begun, together. [DISTANT CLANK] They were succeeded by a clanking noise from the attic as if some person were dragging a heavy chain over the beams. [EERIE RASP] Then he heard the noise much louder coming straight towards his door. [EERIE RASP] [EERIE GROAN] [EERIE GROWL] [SCROOGE]: What do you want with me? [MARLEY]: Much. In life, I was your partner Jacob Marley. You don't believe in me? Why do you doubt your senses? [SCROOGE]: Because a little thing affects them. A slight disorder of the stomach makes them cheats. You might be an undigested bit of beef, a crumb of cheese a fragment of underdone potato. There's more of gravy than of grave about you. [MARLEY GROANS] [MARLEY ROARS] Why do spirits walk the earth? And why do they come to me? [MARLEY]: It is required... [MARLEY RASPS] ...of every man that the sprit within him should walk among his fellow man and travel far and wide and if that spirit goes not forth in life it is condemned to do so after death. Oh, woe is me! [SCROOGE]: You are fettered. [MARLEY]: I wear the chains I forged in life. I made it link by link and yard by yard. I girded it on and of my own free will I wore it. Is its pattern strange to you? Or would you know the weight and length of the strong coil you wear yourself? It was full as heavy and as long as this seven Christmases ago... and you have laboured on it since. [SCROOGE]: Jacob, tell me more. Speak comfort to me! [MARLEY]: I have none to give. [SCROOGE]: But you were always a good man of business, Jacob. [MARLEY]: Business! Mankind was my business. The common welfare was my business. Charity, mercy and benevolence were all my business. [MARLEY SIGHS] [MARLEY GROANS] [MARLEY ROARS] At this time of year, I suffer most. [MAN]: She's a ripe one. Ripe for the picking! [MAN SNIGGERS] [MARLEY]: Why did I walk through crowds of fellow beings with my eyes turned down and never raise them to that blessed star which led the Wise Men to a poor abode! Hear me! My time is nearly gone. I am here tonight to warn you that you have yet a hope of escaping my fate. [SCROOGE]: You were always a good friend to me. Thank ye! [MARLEY]: You will... be haunted by three spirits. [MARLEY RASPS] [MARLEY CHUCKLES] Expect the first when the bell tolls midnight. Look to see me no more and remember what has passed between us. [EERIE GUST] [NARRATOR]: The air was filled with phantoms wandering hither and thither in restless haste and moaning as they went. Every one of them wore chains like Marley's Ghost some few, they might be guilty governments were linked together. None were free. Many had been personally known to Scrooge in their lives. He had been quite familiar with one old ghost who cried piteously at being unable to assist a wretched housekeeper with an infant whom it saw below, upon a doorstep. Whether these creatures faded into mist or mist enshrouded them - he could not tell. - [BABY CRIES] But they and their spirit voices faded together and the night became as it had been. ♪ Hark the herald... ♪ [NARRATOR]: The Ghost of Christmas Past. [CHURCH BELL CHIMES] When Scrooge awoke the neighbouring church struck the four quarters so he listened for the hour. [CHURCH BELL CHIMES] Twelve. Marley's Ghost bothered him exceedingly. Was it a dream, or not? [SCROOGE]: Are you the spirit whose coming was foretold me? [GHOST OF XMAS PAST]: I am the Ghost of Christmas Past. Your past. [SCROOGE]: What business brought you here? [GHOST OF XMAS PAST]: Your welfare. [NARRATOR]: Scrooge expressed himself much obliged but could not help thinking that a night of unbroken rest would have been more conducive to that end. The Spirit must have heard him thinking. [GHOST OF XMAS PAST]: Your reclamation, then. Take heed. [NARRATOR]: It put out its strong hand as it spoke and clasped him gently by the arm. It would have been in vain for Scrooge to plead that the bed was warm and the thermometer a long way below freezing and that he was clad but lightly in his slippers dressing gown and nightcap and that he had a cold upon him at that time. The grasp, though gentle, was not to be resisted. He rose, and somehow knew that the spirit would take him into the air. [SCROOGE]: I am mortal, and liable to fall. [GHOST OF XMAS PAST]: Bear but a touch of my hand there and you shall be upheld in more than this. [NARRATOR]: As the words were spoken they passed through the wall and stood upon an open country road with fields on either hand. [CHILD LAUGHS] [CHILD]: Woohoo! Happy Christmas, Will, Charlie! [SCROOGE]: Good Heaven! I was bred in this place. I was a boy here. [NARRATOR]: He was conscious of a thousand odours floating in the air, each one connected with a thousand thoughts, and hopes, and joys and cares long, long forgotten. [GHOST OF XMAS PAST]: You recollect the way? [SCROOGE]: Remember it! I could walk it blindfold. [GHOST OF XMAS PAST]: Strange you have forgotten it for so many years. [NARRATOR]: They walked along the road Scrooge recognising every gate and post and tree until a little market town appeared in the distance. [GHOST OF XMAS PAST]: These are but the shadows of the things that have been. [CHILD]: See you next year! Next year... How funny that sounds! [GHOST OF XMAS PAST]: The school is not quite deserted. - A solitary child... - [SCHOOL BELL RINGS] ...neglected by his friends is left there still. [NARRATOR]: The spirit touched him on the arm and pointed to his young self a lonely boy reading by a feeble fire. Scrooge wept to see his poor forgotten self as he used to be. [SCROOGE]: Why, it's old Tom! It's dear old, honest Tom. Yes, yes, I know... One Christmas time, when yonder solitary child was left here all alone he did come to cheer me. Poor boy. [NARRATOR]: Scrooge thought he was dreaming but he wasn't. Then, with a rapidity of transition very foreign to his usual character he said, in pity for his former self "Poor boy!" and cried again. [SCROOGE]: I wish... But it's too late now. [GHOST OF XMAS PAST]: What is the matter? [SCROOGE]: Nothing. There was a boy singing a Christmas Carol last night. I should like to have given him something, that's all. [GHOST OF XMAS PAST]: Let us see another Christmas. [NARRATOR]: He was not reading now but walking up and down despairingly. Scrooge looked at the ghost and with a mournful shaking of his head glanced anxiously towards the door. [FAN]: Oh, dear, dear brother! I have come to bring you home, dear brother! To bring you home, home, home! [YOUNG SCROOGE]: Home, little Fan? [FAN]: Yes! Home, for good and all. Home, for ever and ever. Father is so much kinder than he used to be. He spoke so gently to me one night when I was going to bed that I was not afraid to ask him once more if you might come home and he said, "Yes, you should!" and sent me in a coach to bring you. And you are never to come back here. But first... we're to be together all Christmas long and have the merriest time in all the world! [YOUNG SCROOGE]: You are quite a housekeeper, little Fan. [SHE GIGGLES] [GHOST OF XMAS PAST]: You must come with me now. [FAINT CHATTER] Do you know this place? [SCROOGE]: Know it! Of course I know it. Was I not apprenticed here? [NARRATOR]: Scrooge's former self, now grown a young man came briskly in, accompanied by his fellow prentice. [SCROOGE]: Dick Wilkins, to be sure! Bless me, yes, there he is! He was very much attached to me, was Dick. Poor Dick. Why, it's old Fezziwig! Bless his heart, it's Fezziwig, alive again! [NARRATOR]: Old Fezziwig laid down his pen and looked at his watch. He rubbed his hands, adjusted his capacious waistcoat and called out in a comfortable, oily rich, fat, jovial voice... [FEZZIWIG]: Yo-ho, there, Ebenezer! Yo-ho, my boys! No more work tonight! Christmas, Ebenezer. Hilly-ho! Clear away, my lads and let's have lots of room here. Clear away! [NARRATOR]: It was done in a minute. The floor was swept and watered, and the lamps were trimmed and the warehouse was as snug and warm and dry and bright a ballroom as you would desire to see upon a winter's night. In came a fiddler with a music book and went up to the lofty desk, and made an orchestra of it and tuned like 50 stomach aches. In came Mrs Fezziwig, one vast substantial smile. In came the three Miss Fezziwigs beaming and lovable. In came the six young followers whose hearts they broke. In came all the young men and women employed in the business. In came the housemaid, with her cousin, the baker. In came the cook, with her brother's particular friend the milkman. In came the boy from over the way who was suspected of not having board enough from his master. In they all came, anyhow and everyhow. There were dances and more dances and there were forfeits, and more dances and there was cake, and there was negus and there was a great piece of cold roast and there was a great piece of cold boiled and there were mince pies, and plenty of beer. During the whole of this time Scrooge had acted like a man out of his wits. His heart and soul were in the scene and with his former self. It was not until now when the bright face of his former self was turned from them that he remembered the ghost and became conscious that it was looking full upon him. [GHOST OF XMAS PAST]: A small matter to make these silly folk so full of gratitude. [SCROOGE]: Small! [GHOST OF XMAS PAST]: Why? Is it not small? He has spent but a few pounds. Is that so much that he deserves this praise? [NARRATOR]: Scrooge, heated by the remark and speaking unconsciously like his former not his latter self, said... [SCROOGE]: It isn't that, Spirit! He has the power to render us happy or unhappy. To make our service light or burdensome a pleasure or a toil. The happiness he gives is quite as great as if it cost a fortune. [NARRATOR]: He felt the spirit's glance, and stopped. [GHOST OF XMAS PAST]: What is the matter? [SCROOGE]: Nothing in particular. [GHOST OF XMAS PAST]: Something, I think? [SCROOGE]: I should like to be able to say a word or two to my clerk just now. That's all. [CROWD CHEERS] [GHOST OF XMAS PAST]: We must away, to your sister. Always a delicate creature whom a breath might have withered but she had a large heart. [SCROOGE]: So she had. You're right. I'll not deny it for a second. God forbid. [GHOST OF XMAS PAST]: She died a woman and had, I think, children. [SCROOGE]: One child. [GHOST OF XMAS PAST]: True, your nephew. My time grows short. Quick. [BABY CRIES] [NARRATOR]: He was older now. His face had begun to wear the signs of care and avarice. There was an eager, greedy, restless motion in the eye which showed the passion that had taken root and where the shadow of the growing tree would fall. He was sat by the side of a fair young girl in whose eyes there were tears. [BELLE]: It matters little. To you, very little. Another idol has displaced me and if it can cheer and comfort you in time to come as I would have tried to do I have no just cause to grieve. What idol has displaced you? [BELLE]: A golden one. [SCROOGE SCOFFS] This is the even-handed dealing of the world. There is nothing on which it is so hard as poverty and there is nothing it professes to condemn with such severity as the pursuit of wealth! [BELLE]: You fear the world too much. All your other hopes have merged into the hope of wealth. I have seen your nobler aspirations fall off one by one until the master passion, gain, engrosses you. Have I not? [SCROOGE]: What then? Even if I have grown so much wiser, what then? I am not changed towards you. [BELLE]: Am I? Our contract is an old one. It was made when we were both poor and content to be so until, in good season, we could improve our worldly fortune by our patient industry. You are changed. When it was made, you were another man. [SCROOGE]: I was a boy. Your own feeling tells you that you were not then what you are now. That which promised happiness when we were one in heart is fraught with misery now that we are two. It is enough that I have thought of it - and can release you. - Have I ever sought release? [SCROOGE]: In words? - No. Never. - In what, then? [BELLE]: In everything that made my love of any worth or value in your sight. If this had never been between us, tell me would you seek me out and try to win me now? [NARRATOR]: He seemed to yield to the justice of this supposition, in spite of himself. But he said, with a struggle... [SCROOGE]: You think not? [BELLE]: I would gladly think otherwise, if I could. But if you were free today, tomorrow, yesterday can I believe that you would choose a poor girl? You, who now weigh everything by gain. If, for a moment, you were false enough to your one guiding principle I know that your repentance and regret would surely follow. [NARRATOR]: He was about to speak but with her head turned from him she walked away. He did not follow. [SCROOGE]: Spirit! Show me no more! Conduct me home. Why do you delight to torture me? [GHOST OF XMAS PAST]: One shadow more. [SCROOGE]: No more, I don't wish to see it! Show me no more! [NARRATOR]: But the relentless ghost pinioned him in both his arms and forced him to observe what happened next. They were now years hence. A room, not very large or handsome but full of comfort. Near to the fire sat a beautiful young girl so like that last that Scrooge believed it was the same until he saw her now a comely matron, sitting opposite her daughter. And now Scrooge looked on more attentively than ever when the master of the house having his eldest daughter leaning fondly on him sat down with her and her mother at his own fireside. And when he thought that such another creature quite as graceful and as full of promise might have called him father and been a springtime in the haggard winter of his life his sight grew very dim indeed. [SCROOGE]: Spirit! Remove me from this place. [GHOST OF XMAS PAST]: I told you these were shadows of the things that have been. They are what they are. Do not blame me. [SCROOGE]: Remove me! I cannot bear it! [NARRATOR]: He turned upon the ghost and seeing that it looked upon him with a face in which, in some strange way there were fragments of all the faces it had shown him wrestled with it. He was conscious of being exhausted and overcome by an irresistible drowsiness... and further... - of being in his own bedroom. - [CHURCH BELL CHIMES] [HE SNORES] [NARRATOR]: The Ghost of Christmas Present. He woke in the middle of a prodigiously tough snore and sat up in bed to get his thoughts together. [CHOIR SINGS]: ♪ Go, go tell it ♪ ♪ Go, go tell it ♪ ♪ On the mountain... ♪ [NARRATOR]: It was his own room. There was no doubt about that. But it had undergone a surprising transformation. A mighty blaze went roaring up the chimney as that dull petrifaction of a hearth had never known in Scrooge's time, or Marley's or for many and many a winter season gone. A jolly giant, glorious to see who bore a glowing torch in shape not unlike plenty's horn and held it up, high up, to shed its light on Scrooge as he came peeping round the door. [GHOST CHUCKLES] Come in! Come in, and know me better, man! [NARRATOR]: Scrooge entered timidly and hung his head before this spirit. He was not the dogged Scrooge he had been and though the spirit's eyes were clear and kind he did not like to meet them. [GHOST OF XMAS PRESENT]: I am the Ghost of Christmas Present. Look upon me. [NARRATOR]: Scrooge reverently did so. It was clothed in one simple green robe bordered with white fur. This garment hung loosely on the figure. Its feet, observable beneath the ample folds of the garment were bare, and on its head it wore no other covering than a holly wreath. Girded round its middle was an antique scabbard but no sword was in it and the ancient sheath was eaten up with rust. [GHOST OF XMAS PRESENT]: You've never seen - the like of me before. - Never, sir. [GHOST OF XMAS PRESENT]: Have never walked forth with the younger members of my family? [SCROOGE]: I'm afraid I have not. Have you had many brothers, Spirit? [GHOST OF XMAS PRESENT]: More than 1,800. [SCROOGE]: Spirit, conduct me where you will. I went forth last night on compulsion and I learnt a lesson which is working now. Tonight, if you have aught to teach me let me profit by it. [GHOST OF XMAS PRESENT]: Touch my robe. [NARRATOR]: Scrooge did as he was told, and held it fast. [CHOIR SINGS]: ♪ On the mountain ♪ ♪ Go tell it on the mountain ♪ ♪ Go tell ♪ [WOMAN]: Go to sleep, or he won't come. [CHILD]: Will we leave a carrot? [WOMAN 2]: Thank you, Your Majesty. [WOMAN 3]: The size, we'll still be serving it at Easter! [NARRATOR]: They stood in the city streets on Christmas morning. There was nothing very cheerful in the climate or the town and yet there was an air of cheerfulness abroad that the clearest summer air and brightest summer sun might have endeavoured to diffuse in vain. [MAN]: Fresh oysters! Fresh oysters! [NARRATOR]: The people were, by this time, pouring forth. [CROWD CHATTERS] [MAN]: Buy any milk today? The grocers, oh, the grocers! The blended scents of tea and coffee were so grateful to the nose. The sticks of cinnamon so long and straight the candied fruits so caked and spotted with molten sugar. The customers were all so hurried and so eager in the hopeful promise of the day that they tumbled up against each other at the door clashing their wicker baskets wildly. - [CHURCH BELL CHIMES] - But soon, the steeples called good people all to church flocking through the streets in their best clothes and with their gayest faces. And at the same time, there emerged from scores of by-streets, lanes and nameless turnings innumerable people carrying their dinners to the bakers' shops. The sight of these poor revellers appeared to interest the spirit very much for he stood with Scrooge beside him in a baker's doorway and sprinkled incense on their dinners from his torch. [WOMAN]: Mrs Johnson's got beef? She must've been at the old man's wages before he got to the pub! [SHE LAUGHS] [SCROOGE]: Is there a peculiar flavour in what you sprinkle - from your torch? - There is. My own. [SCROOGE]: Would it apply to any kind of dinner on this day? [GHOST OF XMAS PRESENT]: To any kindly given. To a poor one most. [SCROOGE]: Why to a poor one most? [GHOST OF XMAS PRESENT]: Because it needs it most. [SCROOGE]: Spirit, I wonder you, of all the beings in the many worlds about us, should desire to cramp these people's opportunities of innocent enjoyment. [GHOST OF XMAS PRESENT]: I? [SCROOGE]: You would deprive those that have no hearths of their own, the means of cooking every seventh day often the only day on which they can be said to dine at all - wouldn't you? - I... [SCROOGE]: You seek to close these bakeries on the Sabbath. - It comes to the same thing. - I seek... [SCROOGE]: Forgive me if I am wrong. It has been done in your name or at least in that of your family. [GHOST SCOFFS] There are some upon this earth of yours who lay claim to know us and who do their deeds of passion, pride ill will, hatred, envy bigotry and selfishness in our name who are as strange to us and all our kith and kin as if they had never lived. Remember that... and charge their doings on themselves... not us. [TRAIN RATTLES] [TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS] [GIRL 1]: I hope Martha doesn't lose the pennies she saved for the train! [GIRL 2]: She mustn't! I'll miss her. [GIRL 3]: Let's wish she's not too tired from making all those hats. [MAN]: All aboard! [NARRATOR]: Bob had but 15 bob a week. He pocketed on Saturdays but 15 copies of his Christian name and yet the Ghost of Christmas Present blessed his four-roomed house. Up rose Mrs Cratchit dressed out but poorly in a twice-turned gown but brave in ribbons. [MRS CRATCHIT]: What has ever got your precious father then? And your brother, Tiny Tim? And Martha weren't as late last Christmas by half an hour. [BOY]: Here's Martha, Mother! - [CHILDREN]: Hello, Martha! - Hello Martha! [MRS CRATCHIT]: Why! Bless your heart alive, my dear. How late you are! [MARTHA]: We'd a deal of work to finish up last night and had to clear away this morning, Mother. Don't wake me in the morning. I hope to lay abed tomorrow, as it is a holiday! [MRS CRATCHIT]: Well, never mind. Sit ye down before the fire, Lord bless ye. [BOY]: No, no. There's Father coming! Hide, Martha, hide! [NARRATOR]: So Martha hid herself and in came Bob his threadbare clothes darned up and brushed to look seasonable and Tiny Tim upon his shoulder. Alas, for Tiny Tim, he bore a little crutch and had his limbs supported by an iron frame. [CRATCHIT]: Why, where's our Martha? - [MRS CRATCHIT]: Not coming. - Not coming? - Not coming upon Christmas Day? - [CHILDREN GIGGLE] [NARRATOR]: Martha didn't like to see him disappointed if it were only in joke, so she ran into his arms. [MARTHA]: Happy Christmas, Father! [NARRATOR]: The two young Cratchits hustled Tiny Tim and bore him off into the washhouse... [GIRL]: You come with us, Tim! ...that he might hear the pudding singing in the copper. [MRS CRATCHIT]: And how did little Tim behave? [CRATCHIT]: Oh! As good as gold. As good as gold and better. Somehow, he gets thoughtful sitting by himself so much and thinks the strangest things. He told me, coming home, that he hoped the people saw him in the church, because he was a cripple and it might be pleasant to them to remember upon Christmas Day who made lame beggars walk, and blind men see. [NARRATOR]: Bob's voice was tremulous when he told them this and trembled uncertainly when he said that Tiny Tim was growing strong and hearty. His active little crutch was heard upon the floor and back came Tiny Tim escorted by his brother and sister to his stool before the fire. Master Peter, and the two ubiquitous young Cratchits went to fetch the goose with which they soon returned in high procession. Such a bustle ensued that you might have thought a goose the rarest of all birds a feathered phenomenon. And in truth, it was something very like it in that house. [CRATCHIT]: I don't believe there was ever such a goose cooked, my dear! Wonderful! [GIRL]: Scrum-diddlyumptious! [NARRATOR]: Its tenderness and flavour size and cheapness were the themes of universal admiration. [GIRL]: Hope there's gravy! Eked out by apple sauce and mashed potatoes it was a sufficient dinner for the whole family. Indeed, as Mrs Cratchit said with great delight surveying one small atom of a bone upon the dish they hadn't ate it all at last. But now, the plates being changed Mrs Cratchit left the room alone too nervous to bear witnesses to take the pudding up and bring it in. A great deal of steam! The pudding was out of the copper. A smell like a washing day. That was the cloth. A smell like an eating house and a pastry cook's next door to each other with a laundry next door to that. Mrs Cratchit entered flushed but smiling proudly with the pudding like a speckled cannon ball. Everybody had something to say about it but nobody said or thought it was a small pudding for a large family. Any Cratchit would have blushed to hint at such a thing. Then all the Cratchit family drew round the hearth. [CRATCHIT]: A merry Christmas to us all, my dears. God bless us. [TINY TIM]: God bless us, every one! [NARRATOR]: Said Tiny Tim, the last of all. He sat very close to his father's side upon his little stool. Bob held his withered little hand in his as if he loved the child and wished to keep him by his side and dreaded that he might be taken from him. [SCROOGE]: Spirit, tell me if Tiny Tim will live. [GHOST OF XMAS PRESENT]: I see a vacant seat and a crutch without an owner, carefully preserved. If these shadows remain unaltered by the future the child will die. [SCROOGE]: No, no, kind spirit. - Say he will be spared. - If these shadows remain unaltered by the future, no other of my race will find him here. Well, what then? If he be like to die, he had better do it and decrease the surplus population. [NARRATOR]: Scrooge hung his head to hear his own words quoted by the spirit. [GHOST OF XMAS PRESENT]: Man, if man you be in heart not stone, forbear that wicked cant until you have discovered what the surplus is and where it is. Will you decide what men shall live and what men shall die? It may be, that in the sight of Heaven you are more worthless and less fit to live than millions like this poor man's child. Oh, God! To hear the insect on the leaf pronouncing on the too-much-life among his hungry brothers in the dust! [NARRATOR]: Scrooge bent before the ghost's rebuke and trembling, cast his eyes upon the ground. But he raised them speedily, on hearing his own name. [CRATCHIT]: To Scrooge! I'll give you Mr Scrooge, the founder of the feast! [MRS CRATCHIT]: The founder of the feast indeed! I wish I had him here. I'd give him a piece of my mind to feast upon and I hope he'd have a good appetite for it! [CRATCHIT]: My dear, the children. Christmas Day! [MRS CRATCHIT]: I'll drink his health for your sake and the day's, not for his! [NARRATOR]: Tiny Tim drank it last of all but he didn't care two pence for it. Scrooge was the ogre of the family. They were not a handsome family. They were not well dressed. Their shoes were far from being waterproof their clothes were scanty and Bob's might have known, and very likely did the inside of a pawnbroker's. But they were happy, grateful pleased with one another and contented all the time. [CHILDREN GIGGLE] Scrooge had his eye upon them and especially on Tiny Tim, until the last. [LAUGHTER FADES] It was a long night if it were only a night. - Not to sea? - [THUNDER CLAPS] To sea! To Scrooge's horror, looking back he saw the last of the land and his ears were deafened by the thundering of water as it rolled and roared. [MAN]: Mind yourself, Harry! Don't drop the turkey! [NARRATOR]: Built upon a dismal reef of sunken rocks on which the waters chafed and dashed there stood a solitary lighthouse... [MAN]: There's Christmas for you! ...but even here, every man among them hummed a Christmas tune! Again the ghost sped on above the black and heaving sea... [DISTANT VOICES SING] ...until a light shone from the window of a house and swiftly, they advanced towards it. [LOUD LAUGHTER] [MAN LAUGHS AND SIGHS] It was a great surprise to Scrooge to hear a hearty laugh. It was a much greater surprise to Scrooge to recognise it as his own nephew's and to find himself in a bright, dry, gleaming room. [WOMAN]: Clara, my dear, what a lovely lunch! [NARRATOR]: "Ha-ha-ha!" laughed Fred. "Ha-ha-ha-ho!" It is a fair, even-handed, noble adjustment of things that while there is infection in disease and sorrow there is nothing in the world so irresistibly contagious as laughter and good humour. [WOMAN LAUGHS] [FRED]: He said that Christmas was a humbug! And he believed it too. [CLARA]: More shame for him, Fred. [FRED]: He's a comical old fellow, that's the truth and not so pleasant as he might be. However, his offenses carry their own punishment and I have nothing to say against him. [CLARA]: I'm sure he is very rich. At least, you always tell me so. [FRED]: His wealth is of no use to him. He doesn't make any good with it. He doesn't make himself comfortable with it. He hasn't the satisfaction of thinking... [HE CHUCKLES] ...that he is ever going to benefit us with it. [CLARA]: Oh... I have no patience with him. [FRED]: Oh, I have. I'm sorry for him! Couldn't be angry with him if I tried. Who suffers by his ill whims? Himself, always. Here, he takes it into his head to dislike us and he won't come and dine with us. What's the consequence? He doesn't lose much of a dinner. [CLARA SCOFFS] Indeed? I think he loses a very good dinner. [FRED]: Well, I'm very glad to hear it! Because I haven't great faith in these young housekeepers. What do you say, Topper? [NARRATOR]: Topper had clearly got his eye on one of the ladies for he answered that a bachelor was a wretched outcast who had no right to express an opinion on the subject. Fred revelled in another laugh and as it was impossible to keep the infection off... [THEY LAUGH] [FRED]: A merry Christmas and a happy New Year to the old man. He wouldn't take it from me, but he may have it. Let us make a toast to Uncle Scrooge! [FRED LAUGHS AND SIGHS] [WOMAN]: Who's for blind man's buff? [SCROOGE]: Here's a new game! One half hour, Spirit, only one! [NARRATOR]: Uncle Scrooge had imperceptibly become so gay and light of heart that he would have pledged the unconscious company in return and thanked them in an inaudible speech if the ghost had given him time. But the whole scene passed off in the breath of the last word. [CHURCH BELL CHIMES] [GHOST OF XMAS PRESENT]: Hark. My life upon this globe is very brief. [NARRATOR]: The chimes were ringing the three quarters past 11 at that moment. [DOGS BARK] [DISTANT LAUGHTER] [CROWD CHATTERS] [MAN 1]: Please leave me alone. - [MAN 2]: Give it here. - What are you doing? [WOMAN]: You want a good time? [MAN 1]: You're hurting me! - [WOMAN LAUGHS] - Come here, my darling. [MAN 3]: Go on, hit him! And again! [CROWD CLAMOURS] [DOGS BARK] [MAN 4]: Pull your razor, Jim. [MAN SOBS] [SCROOGE]: Forgive me if I am not justified in what I ask but I see something strange, and not belonging to yourself protruding from your skirts. - Is it a foot or a claw? - It might be a claw for the flesh there is upon it. Look here. [NARRATOR]: From the foldings of its robe it brought two children. Wretched, abject, frightful hideous, miserable. They knelt down at its feet and clung upon the outside of its garment. [GHOST OF XMAS PRESENT]: Oh, man, look here! Look! Look, down here! [NARRATOR]: They were a boy and a girl. Yellow, meagre, ragged scowling, wolfish... but prostrate, too, in their humility. Where angels might have sat enthroned devils lurked, and glared out menacing. No change, no degradation, no perversion of humanity has monsters half so horrible and dread. Scrooge started back, appalled. Having them shown to him in this way he tried to say they were fine children but the words choked themselves rather than be parties to a lie of such enormous magnitude. [SCROOGE]: Spirit, are they yours? [GHOST OF XMAS PRESENT]: They are man's. And they cling to me, appealing from their fathers. This boy is Ignorance. This girl is Want. Beware them both, and all of their degree but most of all, beware this boy... [MAN GRUNTS] ...for on his brow I see that written which is doom unless the writing be erased. [SCROOGE]: Have they no refuge or resource? [GHOST OF XMAS PRESENT]: Are there no workhouses? - Are there no prisons? - [OVERSEER YELLS] [WHIP CRACKS] [NARRATOR]: The Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come. [EERIE MOAN] Scrooge looked about him for the ghost and saw it not. As the last stroke ceased to vibrate he remembered the prediction of old Jacob Marley and lifting up his eyes, beheld a solemn phantom draped and hooded coming like a mist along the ground towards him. The phantom slowly, gravely, silently approached. When it came, Scrooge bent down upon his knee. It was shrouded in a deep black garment which concealed its head, its face, its form and left nothing of it visible save one outstretched hand. [SCROOGE]: I am in the presence of the Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come? [NARRATOR]: The Spirit answered not but pointed downward with its hand. [SCROOGE]: You are about to show me shadows of the things that have not happened but will happen in the time before us. Is that so, Spirit? [NARRATOR]: Although well used to ghostly company by this time Scrooge feared the silent shape so much that his legs trembled beneath him and he found that he could hardly stand when he prepared to follow it. [SCROOGE]: I fear you... more than any spectre I have seen. But as I know your purpose is to do me good and as I hope to live to be another man from what I was I am prepared to bear your company and do it with a thankful heart. Lead on. Lead on. The night is waning fast... and it is precious time to me, I know. [CHURCH BELLS ECHO] [NARRATOR]: They scarcely seemed to enter the city but there they were, in the heart of it amongst the merchants, who hurried up and down and chinked the money in their pockets and conversed in groups, as Scrooge had seen them often. The spirit stopped beside one little knot of businessmen. Observing that the hand was pointed to them Scrooge advanced to listen to their talk. [MAN 1]: I don't know much about it, either way. I only know he's dead! [MAN 2]: When did he die? [MAN 1]: Ooh. Last night, I believe. [MAN 3]: Why? What was the matter with him? I thought he'd never die. [MAN 2]: God knows! [MAN 3]: What has he done with his money? [MAN 2]: Well, I haven't heard. Left it to his company, perhaps. He hasn't left it to me. That's all I know. [MAN 1]: Well, it's likely to be a very cheap funeral for upon my life, I don't know of anybody to go to it. [MAN 1 GUFFAWS] Suppose we make up a party and volunteer? I don't mind going if a lunch is provided but I must be fed. [MAN 2 LAUGHS] [NARRATOR]: Scrooge was at first inclined to be surprised that the spirit should attach importance to conversations apparently so trivial but feeling assured that they must have some hidden purpose he set himself to consider what it was likely to be. But nothing doubting that to whomsoever they applied they had some latent moral for his own improvement. - [DOG BARKS] - [ACCORDION PLAYS] They left the busy scene and went into an obscure part of the town where Scrooge had never penetrated before. [MAN]: You've had the pipe long enough. Pass it on. [NARRATOR]: The ways were foul... [MAN]: Cut your liver out! ...the shops and houses wretched the people half-naked, drunken slipshod, ugly. Alleys and archways, like so many cesspools disgorged their offenses of smell and dirt and life upon the straggling streets. [WOMAN]: We don't talk to you lot. [NARRATOR]: The whole quarter reeked with crime with filth, and misery. Far in this den of infamous resort there was a low-browed, beetling shop below a penthouse roof where iron, old rags, bottles bones and greasy offal were bought. Sitting in among the wares he dealt in, by a stove was a grey-haired rascal - nearly 70 years of age. - [DOOR BELL JINGLES] Scrooge and the phantom came into the presence of this man just as a housekeeper with a heavy bundle slunk into the shop. [MAID]: Every person has a right to take care of themselves. He always did. Who's the worse for the loss of a few things like these? If he wanted to keep 'em after he was dead a wicked old screw why wasn't it natural in his lifetime? If it had been, he's have had somebody to look after him when he was struck with death instead of lying gasping out his last, alone by himself. [JOE]: It's the truest ever word that was spoke. It's a judgment on him. [MAID]: Open the bundle, old Joe, and let me know the value of it. [JOE]: What... what do you call this? - Bed-curtains? - Bed-curtains. [JOE LAUGHS WHEEZILY] You don't mean to say you took 'em down rings and all, with him lying there? - [HE CACKLES] - Yes, I do. Why not? [JOE]: You were born to make your fortune and you'll certainly do it. Ooh... [MAID]: You may look through that shirt till your eyes ache but you won't find a hole in it, nor a threadbare place. It's the best he had, and a fine one too. They'd have wasted it, if it hadn't been for me. [JOE]: W... What do you mean, wasting of it? [MAID]: Putting it on him to be buried in, to be sure! Somebody was fool enough to do it, but I took it off again. Oh, this is the end of it, you see. He frightened everyone away from him when he was alive to profit us when he was dead! [SHE LAUGHS] [SCROOGE]: If there is any person in the town who feels emotion caused by this man's death show that person to me, Spirit, I beseech you. ♪ Good people, all ♪ ♪ This Christmas time ♪ [BABY CRIES] [WOMAN]: She's worried to death by it all. But they had to borrow, for the kiddies. [NARRATOR]: The phantom spread its dark robe before him for a moment, like a wing and withdrawing it, revealed a room by daylight where a mother and her children were. She was expecting someone, and with anxious eagerness for she walked up and down the room started at every sound, looked out from the window glanced at the clock. At length, the long-expected knock was heard. She hurried to the door, and met her husband a man whose face was careworn and depressed though he was young. There was a remarkable expression in it now a kind of serious delight, of which he felt ashamed and which he struggled to repress. [WOMAN]: Is it good or bad? [MAN]: Bad. [WOMAN SIGHS] We are quite ruined. [MAN]: No. There is hope yet, Caroline. [CAROLINE]: If he relents, there is. Nothing is past hope if such a miracle has happened. [MAN]: He is past relenting. He is dead. [NARRATOR]: She was a mild and patient creature if her face spoke truth but she was thankful in her soul to hear it and she said so, with clasped hands. She prayed forgiveness the next moment and was sorry. [CAROLINE]: To whom shall our debt be transferred? [MAN]: I don't know. But before that time, we shall be ready with the money and even though we were not, it would be bad fortune indeed to find so merciless a creditor in his successor. We shall sleep tonight with light hearts, Caroline. [SCROOGE]: Let me see some tenderness connected with the death. [NARRATOR]: They entered poor Bob Cratchit's house and found the mother and the children seated round the fire. Quiet. Very quiet. The noisy little Cratchits were as still as statues in one corner. [MRS CRATCHIT SIGHS] The mother laid her work upon the table and put her hand up to her face. [MRS CRATCHIT]: Colour hurts my eyes. It makes them weak by candlelight and I wouldn't show weak eyes to your father when he comes home, for the world. It must be near his time. [MARTHA]: Past it, rather. But I think he's walked a little slower than he used these few last evenings, Mother. [MRS CRATCHIT]: I have known him walk with Tiny Tim upon his shoulder, very fast indeed. [MARTHA]: And so have I. Often. [MRS CRATCHIT]: His father loved him so that it was no trouble... Ah! And there is your father at the door! [NARRATOR]: Two young Cratchits got upon his knees and laid each child a little cheek against his face. [GIRL]: Don't mind it, Father. [BOY]: Don't be grieved. [NARRATOR]: Bob was very cheerful with them and spoke pleasantly to all the family. He looked at the work upon the table the shroud that would clothe his son and praised the industry and speed of Mrs Cratchit and the girls. "They would be done long before Sunday," he said. [MRS CRATCHIT]: You went today then, Robert? [CRATCHIT]: Yes, my dear. I wish you could have gone. It would've done you good to see how green a place it is where he will lay. But you'll see it often. I promised him... that I would walk there on a Sunday. [NARRATOR]: He broke down all at once. He couldn't help it. He left the room, and went upstairs to the room above which was lighted cheerfully, and hung with Christmas. There was a chair set close beside the child and there were signs of someone having been there lately. Poor Bob sat down in it and when he had thought a little and composed himself he kissed the little face. [CRATCHIT]: My little, little child... My little child. [NARRATOR]: They drew about the fire, and talked the girls and mother working still. Bob told them of the extraordinary kindness of Mr Fred, whom he had scarcely seen but once and who, meeting him in the street that day and seeing that he looked a little subdued asked after him. [CRATCHIT]: Just a little down, you know. On which, for he is the pleasantest-spoken gentleman you ever heard... [FRED]: What has happened to distress you? [CRATCHIT]: I told him. "I am heartily sorry for it, Mr Cratchit and heartily sorry for your good wife. If I can be of service to you in any way," he said giving me his card, "That's where I live. Pray, come to me." Now, it really seemed as if he had known our Tiny Tim and felt with us. I shouldn't be at all surprised, mark what I say if he got Peter a better situation. [MRS CRATCHIT]: Oh! Only hear that, Peter! [CRATCHIT]: But however and whenever we part from one another I am sure, we shall none of us forget poor Tiny Tim, shall we? Or this first parting that there was among us. [ALL]: No, Father. [CRATCHIT]: And I know, my dears that when we recollect how patient and how mild he was although he was a little... little child... we shall not quarrel easily among ourselves and forget poor Tiny Tim in doing it. [ALL]: No, never, Father. [CRATCHIT]: I am very happy. [HE SNIFFS] I am very happy. [SCROOGE]: Spectre, something informs me that our parting moment is at hand. I know it, but I know not how. Tell me what man that was whom we saw lying dead. [THUNDER CRACKS] [NARRATOR]: The spirit stood among the graves and pointed down to one. Scrooge advanced towards it, trembling. [SCROOGE]: Before I draw nearer to that stone to which you point, answer me one question. Are these the shadows of the things that will be or are they shadows of things that may be, only? [NARRATOR]: Still the ghost pointed downward to the grave by which it stood. [SCROOGE]: Men's courses will foreshadow certain ends to which, if persevered in, they must lead but if the courses be departed from the ends will change. Say it is thus with what you show me. [NARRATOR]: The spirit was immovable as ever. Scrooge crept towards it, trembling as he went. [SCROOGE]: Am I that man who lay upon the bed? [NARRATOR]: Following the finger read upon the stone of the neglected grave his own name... Ebenezer Scrooge. [THUNDER CRACKS] [JOE LAUGHS] I hope he didn't die of anything catching! [MAN]: We are quite ruined. [NARRATOR]: The finger pointed from the grave to him and back again. [SCROOGE]: No, Spirit! No... No! Spirit, hear me. I am not the man I was. Why show me this, if I am past all hope? Good Spirit, assure me that I yet may change these shadows that you have shown me, by an altered life. I will honour Christmas in my heart and try to keep it all year. I will live in the past, the present, and the future. The spirits of all three shall strive within me. I will not shut out the lessons that they teach. Oh... tell me I may sponge away the writing on this stone! [NARRATOR]: In his agony, he clasped the spectral body. It sought to free itself but he was strong in his entreaty, and detained it. The spirit, stronger yet, repulsed him. Holding up his hands in a last prayer to have his fate reversed he saw an alteration in the phantom's hood. It shrank, and collapsed down into a bedpost. [SCROOGE SOBS] [SCROOGE]: Live in the past, the present, and the future. The spirits of all three shall strive within me. I will not shut out the lessons that they teach! [BIRDS SING] Oh, Jacob Marley! Heaven, and the Christmastime be praised for this. I shall kneel, old Jacob, on my knees. Ah! They are not torn down. They are not torn down! Rings and all. They are here... I am here! The shadows of the things that would have been may be dispelled. They will be! I know they will. I don't know what to do! I am as... light as a feather! I am as happy as an angel! I am as merry as a schoolboy, I am as giddy as a drunken man! A merry Christmas to everyone! A happy New Year to all the world! Hello there! Woo! There's the saucepan that the gruel was in! There's the corner the Ghost of Christmas Present sat. There's the window where I saw the wandering spirits! It's all right, it's all true. It all happened! [HE LAUGHS] I don't know what day of the month it is I don't know how long I've been among the spirits. I don't know anything! I'm... quite a baby. Never mind. I don't care! I'd rather be a baby! Hello, whoop! Hello there! [NARRATOR]: Running to the window, he opened it and put out his head. No fog, no mist. Clear, bright, sweet, fresh air! Merry bells. Oh, glorious! Glorious! [SCROOGE]: What's today, my fine fellow? [BOY]: Today? Why, Christmas Day. [SCROOGE]: It's Christmas Day! I haven't missed it. The spirits have done it all in one night! They can do anything they like, of course they can. Of course they can... Hello, my fine fellow! Do you know the poulterer's, in the next street but one? [BOY]: I should hope I did. [SCROOGE]: An intelligent boy! A remarkable boy! Do you know whether they've sold the prize turkey that was hanging up there? Not the little prize turkey. The big one? [BOY]: What... - The one as big as me? - What a delightful boy! It's a pleasure to talk to him. Yes, my buck! - [BOY]: It's hanging there now. - Is it? Go and buy it. [BOY]: Walker! [SCROOGE]: No, no, I am in earnest. Go and buy it, and tell them to bring it here that I may give them the direction where to take it. Come back with the man, and I'll give you a shilling. Come back with him in less than five minutes and I'll give you half a crown. I'll send it to Bob Cratchit's! He shan't know who sends it. It's twice the size of Tiny Tim. [FAINT STREET CHATTER] [NARRATOR]: He dressed himself all in his best and at last, got out into the streets. He had not gone far, when coming on towards him he beheld the gentlemen who had accosted him the day before, and said "Scrooge and Marley's, I believe." [SCROOGE]: Dear sir, how do you do? I hope you succeeded yesterday? [MAN]: Mr Scrooge? [SCROOGE]: That is my name and I fear it may not be pleasant to you. Allow me to ask your pardon. And will you have the goodness... [MAN]: Lord bless me! My dear Mr Scrooge, are you serious? [SCROOGE]: If you please, not a farthing less. A great many back-payments are included in it, I assure you. Will you do me that favour? [MAN]: I don't know what to say to such munificence! [SCROOGE]: Don't say anything. Please, come and see me. Will you come and see me? [MAN]: We will! [SCROOGE]: Thank you. I am much obliged to you. I thank you 50 times. Bless you! [NARRATOR]: The people were, by this time, pouring forth as he had seen them with the Ghost of Christmas Present. He walked about the streets and watched the people hurrying to and fro and patted children on the head, and questioned beggars and looked down into the kitchens of houses and up to the windows and found that everything could yield him pleasure. He had never dreamed that any walk that anything... could give him so much happiness. [HE LAUGHS] [NARRATOR]: In the afternoon, he turned his steps towards his nephew's house. He passed the door a dozen times before he had the courage to go up and knock. But he made a dash, and did it. He opened the door gently, and sidled his face in. They were looking at the table which was spread out in great array for these young housekeepers are always nervous on such points and like to see that everything is right. [FRED]: Why, bless my soul! Who's that? [SCROOGE]: It's I. Uncle Scrooge. I've come to dinner. Will you let me in, Fred? [FRED LAUGHS] [NARRATOR]: Let him in? It is a mercy he didn't shake his arm off! He was at home in five minutes. Nothing could be heartier. Fred's wife looked just the same. So did Topper when he came. So did the plump lady when she came. So did everyone when they came! Wonderful party, wonderful games wonderful unanimity wonderful happiness! But he was early at the office next morning. Oh, he was early there. If he could only be there first and catch Bob Cratchit coming late! That was the thing he'd set his heart upon. And he did it! Yes, he did. The clock struck nine... No Bob. A quarter past... No Bob. He was a full 18 minutes and a half behind his time. Scrooge sat with his door wide open that he might see him enter. His hat was off before he opened the door his comforter too. He was on his stool in a jiffy, driving away with his pen as if he were trying to overtake nine o'clock. [SCROOGE]: Hello. What do you mean by coming here at this time of day? [CRATCHIT]: I'm very sorry, sir. I am behind my time. [SCROOGE]: You are. Yes, I think you are. Step this way, if you please. [CRATCHIT]: I-It's only once a year, sir. It shall not be repeated. I was making rather merry yesterday, sir. [SCROOGE]: Now, I'll tell you what, my friend I'm not going to stand this sort of thing any longer and therefore... And therefore, I am about to raise your salary. [NARRATOR]: Bob trembled and got a little nearer to the poker. He had a momentary idea of knocking Scrooge down with it holding him, and calling to the people in the court for help and a strait-waistcoat. [SCROOGE]: A merry Christmas, Bob. A merrier Christmas, Bob, my good fellow than I have given you for many a year. I'll raise your salary and endeavour to assist your struggling family and we will discuss your affairs this very afternoon over a Christmas bowl of smoking bishop, Bob! [THEY LAUGH] Make up the fires, buy another coalscuttle before you dot another "i", Bob Cratchit! Scrooge was as good as his word. He did it all, and infinitely more. And to Tiny Tim, who did not die he was a second father. He became as good a friend as good a master and as good a man as the good old city knew or any other good old city, town or borough in the good old world. Some people laughed to see the transformation in him but he let them laugh, and heeded them little for he was wise enough to know that nothing ever happened on the globe, for good at which some people had not had their fill of laughter at the outset and since he knew such as these were blind anyway he thought it just as well that their eyes should wrinkle up in laughter, as have the malady in less attractive forms. He had no further intercourse with spirits but lived life according to the Total Abstinence Principle ever after. And it was said of him that he knew how to keep Christmas well if any man in the world had such knowledge. Let that be truly said of us and all of us. And, as Tiny Tim observed... "God bless us, every one."
