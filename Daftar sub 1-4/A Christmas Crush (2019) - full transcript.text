Well, good morning, Addie, dear. [chuckling] I think this belongs to you. Yes! Well, no, actually. I... I bought it for you. You said you didn't get a chance to do any decorating this year, so I thought... You'd decorate me? It was supposed to be the door. Aww, that is so thoughtful. And it's such a beautiful wreath. It's fresh balsam. Yes, I noticed when the needles went up my nose. Can I make it up to you with a Very Berry Christmas muffin? Hmm... Fresh baked this morning. What's the occasion? Oh, well, you know, Christmas is the busiest time of year at my office, so I thought I'd brighten everyone's Monday. It's hard to be grumpy with a Merry Berry Muffin in your mouth. - Sorry! - Oh, Addie! I'm sorry, I... I thought you saw me. No, I'm sorry. I should have seen you. [sighing] Well, hey, maybe you can reassemble... Or maybe not. Oh, shoot. - I'm... such a klutz. - Such a klutz. [chuckling] Can I buy you some more or something? No. No, um, that's not necessary. They're just... muffins. Just muffins? I mean... based on how good they smell, that's like saying the Mona Lisa is "just" a painting. These must be homemade, right? Yeah, but... you know, no big deal. Oh. There's a lone survivor. For me? - Yeah. - No. Please. I can't bring one muffin to work. It would be like Lord of the Flieswith office supplies. - You sure? - Yeah. Okay. Thank you. - So, what are... - So, how are you... [both chuckling] You should go. You gotta get to work, right. I didn't actually mean you should go. I don't know why that just came out like that. No, I have to get to work, too, so we both have to get to work. - Yeah, I guess. - Yeah, absolutely. Ooh, sorry. We do actually have to both go. - Yeah, anyway, have a good day. - You have a good day, too. I'm really sorry about that. No, I'm so sorry. I shouldn't be here. - Have a good day. - You too. Uh, see ya. - Around. - Later. Okay. - Okay, bye. See ya. - Bye. Let's get that wreath on the door. [Mrs. Motley] Mmm... Oh, we'll just try the bow at the bottom, dear. There we go. Thank you, sweetie pie. Ooh, it's so nice. [Addie] "You should go, Sam." Who says that? Morning, Addie. - Oh, good morning, Drea. - Everything okay? - I ran into Sam this morning. - Ooh, what happened? I may have inadvertently told him to go away. What did he do? He went away... Yep, I know. You work with the scariest people in the world. Social media influencers? I was thinking more like uptight brides or sweet sixteen moms. But you plan parties for these people. You deal with impossible venues, difficult vendors, catering crises, DJ disasters. What is it about Sam that makes you so nervous? I don't know. He's just so handsome, and sweet, and funny, and... And...? And I just want him to like me as much as I like him. So, then ask him out. - I can't do that. - What? No, look, it's easy. "Sam, I can't help but falling in love with you." Uh... or "I'm all shook up "and I'll have a blue Christmas without you." Been listening to a lot of Elvis on the way in. Yeah, apparently. Look, it's not that easy, Drea, okay? What if I scare him off? I can't risk it. So what? You're just gonna keep running into him in the hallway for the rest of your life? No, not the rest of my life. Just... until he meets someone else. Good grief. - [clearing throat] - Mr. Doyle! Addison, Andrea, I just wanna see how the Donner event is coming. Good. We booked the venue and the guest list is almost ready. We're still working out a possible theme and charity partners, but otherwise, everything's right on schedule. It's been a really great experience. Yeah, we were just talking about how fun it's been to plan a whole party in one week, especially 'cause he ripped up the plans he preapproved six months ago. I know Donner's tough. I worked on a winter gala a few years ago where we had to count the strands of tinsel on the tree to make sure they were in even numbers. [laughing] Wait, seriously? When I first started here, Donner was the life of the party, but then he and his son had a falling out a few years ago, and since then, he... Just make sure there's no shenanigans. Donner hates shenanigans. I gotta say, I'm really impressed with the work you've done this past year, ladies. That giant swan at the Teen America Princess Pageant - was inspired. - Thank you, sir. And if the Donner event goes well, your names are at the top of the list for the Wagner/Robinson wedding next Christmas. In Rome? Everyone in the company's gunning for that event. And now it's yours to lose. Don't let me down. We won't, Mr. Doyle. Thank you so much! - Okay. - [squealing happily] Leslie Wagner and Terrance Robinson! I read yesterday, they're filming the sequel to All I Want Is Everything, Everything Is All I Want. Half of Hollywood is going to be at this wedding. And the other half is gonna be insanely jealous they're not. We have to get this. Well, then, I guess we really, really, really have to do well for the Donner Party. The Donner Legacy Foundation Party. The... The Donner Party's something else entirely. That makes sense. Then we really wouldn't get the wedding. Yeah.

I think Sam will be staying around for Christmas as well. Oh, really? [chuckling nervously] Did he mention if he had any plans while he was here? Uh-uh. He's such a nice young man. He is. Handsome, too. Is he? I never noticed. I hadn't noticed you hadn't noticed. [both chuckling] Oh, you can't go through life afraid to tell people how you feel, Addie. Why, if I had done that, I never would have met Gerald. Was Gerald your husband? My podiatrist. [chuckling] My point is that if you're not honest about how you feel, you don't know what you might be missing. You sound like Drea. I knew I liked that girl. And I know I like Sam, but I can't just... tell him. [Christmas music playing on speaker] Oh! Turn it up. [Addie] I love this song. I've been listening to it all day on my phone!

But how did you know where I work? The internet told me. Drea Andrews?! Get over here! - Pete Larson... - [laughing] Should've known you two were still peas in a pod. Well, you know... So, how'd you guys reconnect? Pete moved in next door. - [Drea] That's crazy. - [Addie] Right? We're gonna go grab some dinner. You wanna come with? Not me, no. I have a conference call for a dog's 14th birthday tonight. And before you ask if I'm kidding, no, I'm not. There's a great little diner right around the corner. Actually, I passed a place, Radicchio's, on the way here. Radicchio's? That place is fancy. Well, it looked "radicch-ulously" good. [all laughing] I will go anywhere for a good bad pun. Let's do it.

Probably because he doesn't remember that you and Drea used to give people balloons on their birthdays. I totally forgot about that. There was this old helium tank in the basement, left over from a PTA carnival. My friend Drea and I... Stole the key from Mr. Mitchell. Yeah. We got the birthday list from Mrs. Waldren and we gave out balloons at lunch. And no one questioned where you got the balloons from? Nobody questions balloons. People love balloons. I hadn't thought about that in years. [Pete] I just thought you should be reminded. [Addie] Thanks, Pete. It's really sweet of you to remember. You're hard to forget. Excuse me. Uh, yeah, over here. Yeah. Um, you know, actually, I'll, uh... I'll take all of them. Yep, just give me all of them. Thank you very much. Yeah, there you go. Yeah. - And there you go. - Oh! Wow! Because you should have something that's as beautiful as you are. [laughing] Thanks. They are beautiful... if you like things that wither and die. As opposed to things that fly away and fall into the ocean, where turtles can choke on them? [Pete] I guess I'd be worried about that if I thought there was any chance that my Addie would let go of my beautiful balloons to grab some clichéd flowers. [Pete laughing] Tell him, Addie. What are we talking about? Your neighbour, tell him that what we have will never be eaten by sea turtles. Cheque please. ♪ ♪ [sighing] ♪ eurt ti shiw dna doul ti ekam ♪ ♪ eurt ti shiw dna doul ti ekam ♪ Why are you singing a Middle English love ballad to a muffin? It's not Middle English. It's backwards. - Backwards? - Yeah. Remember how I said "Make a Wish For Christmas" was playing when I made my wish? Well, now I'm trying to reverse it by making... this muffin disappear. You know, singing backwards, dancing backwards. - Dancing backwards? - Yeah, like, uh... ♪ Samtsirhc rof shiw a ekam... ♪ Stop. That is horrifying. Why are you doing the Macarena? It's the only dance I know. That is also horrifying. Yeah, well, what am I supposed to do, Drea? Okay? Christmas is in a few days and I've tried everything I can think of. I've tried wishbones, 11:11, I've tried eyelashes, I've tried paying some kid $20 to buy her birthday wish. I even threw a $10 roll of quarters into the fountain at the mall, only to have some other kid fish them out and use them to buy a pretzel dog. Hmm. Enterprising youth. [sighing] For now, at least, I talked to Pete and he promised not to do anything else crazy. [woman] Addie, your meeting is here. Donner? He's a little early. No, not Mr. Donner. There's a guy here to see you. He brought a tree. Describe "anything else crazy." Pete, what is this? I missed you. Okay, but what is this? Oh. This is a Christmas tree. You said you wanted a tree for your office, so, I cut one down this morning. - Cut one down from where? - There's a park near here. Forget it. [both gasping] Shenanigans! Okay, you need to take care of this whole situation - before Mr. Donner gets here. - Let's go. Okay, off we go. Out we go. [yelping] - Hurry up. - But we're losing the angel. You can't have a Christmas tree without an angel. Some people think you can have a star, but you can't have a star. [Drea] Mr. Donner, I'm so delighted to see you. Do you like the tree? You met our receptionist. She's from North Dakota. That's a place. Let's move. [Drea] All right, now, you just follow me. This is the reception area. This is where we "recept." Oh! But you wanna look at the screen because that is what will tell you what we do, which, in case you were wondering, is event planning. That's why you came to us. And, um, it's big and bright, so that's fun. Oh, hey. How are ya? How's the Bird event coming? Good? Great. Yeah. - Is everything okay? - No. No, Pete, everything is not okay. Okay? Because I have a very important client outside this door, a client that is not the sort of person that likes shenanigans, so you need to go. [exhaling deeply] I'm sorry. - [Drea] And, um, it's big... - No! Pete, no! [Drea] And there's a lot of colours... Oh! Um, look, uh, just this way. Count the wreaths. I think that you will really like doing that. Uh, you don't mind company, do you? I'll be right back. [Drea] And it's three wreaths. Oh, thank God. There you are. Oh! Mr. Donner, so nice to see you. Do you mind if I give this some water? We'll just get you situated in my office. Nice tie. These fresh-cut trees, if you don't water them immediately, they'll dry out. [Addie] Here's the way. Take a seat. All right. And we are just going to show you what we have been working on. Where did she go? Um... Okay, uh, yeah. I'm gonna do a presentation for you that I am absolutely, 100% prepared for. It's a good tree, right? Way better than some stupid flowers. She likes it. Pete, what are you doing? Just trying to keep the tree fresh. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Let's go. Thank you for the water. The tree thanks you, too. Okay, look... Can't not have a beautiful tree. Okay, I need to get in there, so I need you to quietly get this tree out of here. - But I... - I know you decorated it for me and I love it, I really love it, but I want to love it somewhere far away from here. Please. Your wish is my command. [sighing] Unfortunately. This could be you! And, uh... and a beautiful lady. Um, she's there too. And, um... And then, of course, maybe a waiter or something over here. Um, he's just passing out food and drinks, and, you know, adding to merry-making. - Hi! - Hi! Hi, Mr. Donner. I see that Drea has filled you in on some of our... uh, our thoughts. Um, wow. Um, in terms of entertainment, we've been working on some... a few possibilities. And that is the first act. He will open with, uh, something. And so, this is... [speaking indistinctly] Ho ho ho! [bleating] [Drea] We're trying something new here. You know, something... Yes, yes. It's, uh... this is the first act. It's not just some weird, random man with a Christmas tree in the window... [chuckling] ...juggling... lemons. Um, this is actually... A Christmas comedian! - A Christmas comedian! - A Christmas comedian! [both laughing] [Pete humming] [sighing] Oh gosh... Should I put it in the corner? Pete, can you just give us a minute? So, not in the corner? I'm gonna get it some more water. This officially became a problem. No, this has been a problem. This is officially a disaster. Where are you going? Well, now that Mr. Donner thinks there's such a thing as a "Christmas comedian," I need to go book one who, in his words, isn't just going to "make people sad." [sighing] ♪ ♪ Was it me or did he really like the juggling? I think he wasn't sure at first, but then, when I added the song... Oh, yeah. The song was the turning point. The fun part - I've never tap-danced before. It was like something came over me. Did you feel that in there? The panic or the nausea? Addie, there's something I wanna ask you. Can't it wait till we get upstairs? Please? - I just want to go up... - [clearing throat] Oh gosh. What's going on? Uh, Christmas comedy? It'll just take a second. Is there gonna be an encore performance? - Under no circumstances. - Just a quick question. Guess I'll just have to use my imagination then. You won't even come close. - Addie! - What, Pete? What is it?! - Oh, wow. - What is happening? Addison A... I have a speech. No, actually, you don't. And... Oh my gosh. How did you pay for this? Some credit cards, some loans, my 401k. My fiancée was angry, but... Your fiancée? I'm sorry... I'm sorry. You have a fiancée? I had a fiancée, but I broke it off today. You broke up with your fiancée? - Wow. - [Pete] My last one, not you. Sam, I swear, this is not what it looks like at all. Really? Because what it looks like is that you've been dating a guy with a fiancée, who appears to have broken up with her for you. Yeah, it's pretty much like that. It's actually nothing... nothing like that. Man, I have not found what I'm looking for. Oh, Sam, please, just let me ex... No, Addie. Good night. [sighing] Pete! Listen to me. This... this is insane. Right? I mean, I've been trying to talk myself out of it. I-I love Gina and our wedding's in two weeks. Two weeks? I know we won't get the deposits back. Wait, you never even mentioned her. I never meant for any of this to happen. No matter what I told myself, I couldn't get my mind off of the girl next-door. It was like I was... Under a spell. [sighing] Okay. Pete, I need you to do me a favour. I need you to find out the return policy on this ring. You prefer the princess cut? Then you need to call your fiancée. Wait. You or the last one? Because I don't think she wants to hear any more about us. I mean... You know what? Uh, don't call anyone. Just... just wait for me in your room. - I'll practice my speech. - Perfect! It's really good. I used a thesaurus. - I'll miss you. - Yeah. Bye. [knocking] Addie! Are you okay? My little project just became a huge problem. Come in, dear. [Addie] Thank you, Mrs. Motley. There's no problem so big that a pot of camomile can't make it a little smaller. I think it's gonna take more than camomile to make this problem go away. All I wanted was one Christmas with someone special. Instead, Sam hates me, I've completely ruined Pete's life. I tried to unwish it, but... No falling star? It's not enough to just say the words, dear. A true wish has to come from the heart. It is. I want things to go back to normal with all my heart. I'm afraid it's not that simple. You can't force a wish from the heart. It has to come from inside. Christmas is just around the corner. Well, since you can't wish your way out of this, you really have only one option. You need to make Pete fall out of love. But I did. He dumped his fiancée. Oh. You didn't mean with her. Wait. Wait, you're saying I just need to make Pete fall out of love with me? That's it? It's easier said than done. You're dealing with a powerful enchantment. Mrs. Motley, my whole life, I've been making guys fall out of love with me without even trying. This is going to be a piece of cake.

Woo-hoo. Oh, thanks, Sam. No problem. Did you hear that racket last night? What was that? I believe that was music. Not that it's any of my business, dear, but I notice you've been avoiding Addie. She misses you. The first time I saw Addie, I'd just moved in, and she asked me what my favourite kind of cookie was. And then she shows up with this tray of fresh-baked double chocolate chippers. And I thought, "Wow. What an amazing new neighbour I have." - She's very thoughtful. - That's what I thought. But now, I don't know what to think. Give her a chance to explain. I don't know what she could say. That's true... you don't. He harmonized to your bagpipes? He got so into it he started beatboxing. To "Blue Christmas"? Drea, this is a disaster. I mean, I've tried everything. I borrowed Sondra's dog. I let it bark all day. And he showed up the next morning with a sweater he knitted for it. He can knit? It fit perfectly. I mean, I've never had this problem before. How do you get the sweetest guy in the world to dislike you? Christmas is in three days. The Donner party is in two. Donner event. Point is, time is limited. You know what you need? You need someone who really knows Pete. Someone who can talk some sense into him, you know? Tell him you're not his dream girl. Just his unimpressive next-door neighbour. Thanks. Here for you. All right. Let's think about this. Who did he hang out with in high school? - [gasps] Rod Charles? - He's in jail. Oh. Um, how about... [gasps] Michael James? - He moved to Germany. - Okay. Um, let's see. Hmm. Greg Lawrence? - He's in jail in Germany. - Wow. - Kind of ran with a rough crowd. - I'd say. So, we don't know any of his friends. His family is back in Portland. And he doesn't know anyone here. [sighing] Yes, he does. Okay. What if the trick to making Pete fall out of love with me is to make him fall in love with somebody else? And if she still loves Pete and this fruitcake comes in throwing him back to her, it's a win-win, don't you think? "Fruitcake"? Thanks, Drea. Always. So, you sure she works here? That's what it says on her Facebook profile. You friended her? From a fake account. It's fine. So, uh, who we looking for? You sure it's her? She looks so different. I know. She looks so... sad. [sighing] Hi. Excuse me. Welcome to Santa's Ho-Ho-Holiday Emporium, the happiest place south of the North Pole. Sorry. It's been a week. What can I wrap for you? Oh, we don't need anything wrapped. Oh. Do you need to check out? No. Nothing to check out, either. I wanted to talk to you about Pete Larson. I never want to hear that name ever again. I'm Addie Anderson. You're Addie? Oh, listen, Gina. I'm so sorry. Sorry? Oh. You mean for, uh, stealing my fiancé, ruining my wedding and destroying my life? Don't worry about it. I'm doing great. Yeah. We can see that. You know the wedding was supposed to be in two weeks? We'll never get our deposits back. So, I'm spending my holiday doing seasonal temp jobs to pay for a wedding I'll never have. I'm so sorry about that. But you know, it's not his fault. Weird. I thought he was the one who called and dumped me. Wait. Yeah. He was. Okay. But he's not really thinking clearly, and also, I didn't mean for any of this to happen. Yeah. Addie doesn't even like him that much. And you took him anyway. Okay. You may not be helping. Um, listen. You have got to believe me. If you'd just let me explain, I could... - Addie? - Yes? Do you have something you need wrapped? - What? - I'm gift-wrapping. Do you need to check out? No, but... Either merchandise or other women's fiancés. - No? - No, but... Thanks for shopping at Santa's Ho-Ho-Holiday Emporium. Next? Well, that was a bust. I guess we better get going. Nope. I can play her game. Thank you for shopping at Santa's Ho-Ho-Holiday Emporium. I'm buying this. And one gift wrap, please. Listen, Gina. There's been a misunderstanding, okay? This whole Pete thing is... I told you I don't want to hear his name. It's not what you think, all right? He moved in next door, and I didn't even know... That'll be $6.09, please. How did you... Would you like to add a bow for 99 cents? That was fast. Yeah. Apparently, we're dealing with the Usain Bolt of gift-wrapping. Well, we tried. I guess we better get... Try again. Not exactly where I was going with that. What? [sighing] Thank you for shopping at Santa's Ho-Ho-Holiday Emporium. Hi. Good afternoon. How are you? Thank you for shopping at Santa's Ho-Ho-Holiday Emporium. Hi. Merry Christmas. How are you this evening? Thank you for shopping at Santa's Ho-Ho-Holiday Emporium. Wrap 'em. That's going to be $182.00. I'll take the pretty red Christmas tree paper. You'd better talk fast. I need your help. See, Pete... Your fiancé is confused. He seemed pretty clear to me. "Addie is so sweet and beautiful." Then again, maybe he is confused. I'm going to let that slide 'cause you're a little upset. Good, 'cause I'm just getting started. - Oh, for Pete's sake... - Stop saying his name! Gina, I don't want your fiancé. I want to help you get him back. What do you mean? Pete is a great guy, okay? But I don't love him the way you do. He was never supposed to fall in love with me at all. That's obvious. [sighing] Listen. I have a plan to get you two back together, but I need your help. What if I don't want him back? Oh, come on, Gina. You know you want him back, because he's the sweetest, nicest guy in this entire city. You love him. And I know that he loves you, too, okay? He's just a little confused, and I'm going to... I'm going to make him un-confused. Will you help me? That's going to be $212.40. But you said that... I'm going to add bows to all of them. Hmm? Okay. If I were going to help you, what would I have to do? ♪ ♪ [paper crinkling] You know, I think you may have wasted quite a bit of money on this wrapping. It's worth it if it works. - Do you think it will? - It has to. [knocking on door] This is it? This is the one. Drea? You will be on hair and makeup duty. And what will you be doing tomorrow? I need to go to the park and set up. You're gonna need quite a bit of help if you want to get this done in time. I called everyone. They're either out of town or busy. Well, not everyone. [sighing] [knocking on door] Hi, Addie. Hi, Sam. What can I do for you? I need a favour. Why don't you ask your fiancé? Oh. [chuckling] I know it looks bad, Sam. What, that you were going on dates with me while getting engaged to a guy who was already engaged? I mean, how could that look bad? It's not what you think. And, yeah, I know, I know. That's the biggest cliché. You think it's exactly what you think, but I think that - if you think about it, you'd... - Addie... Sorry. Listen. I know you might not want to do this for me. But what if I said it wasn't for me? What if I said it was for true love? So, you're saying that you and Pete were never dating? Strictly friends. But he fell in love with you and moved next door. [sneezing] Sorry. Um, not in that order. He only moved in a little while ago. He's... under a lot of stress. [laughing] Stress? When I get stressed, I order a pizza. I don't go shopping for engagement rings. [chuckling] Okay. The point is, Pete is just my friend. He's not my boyfriend and he's definitely not my fiancé. So, as a... [sneezing] As a friend, I'm helping him get his life back. Are you okay? Are you coming down with a cold or something? I think it's this scarf, actually. Well, let's get it off you. Yeah. So, you really think you can fix this? If this doesn't work, I don't know what will. Okay, this is it. Zero hour. Everyone knows their roles? - When I give the signal... - Yeah. We know. We've already been through this, like, four times. Just making sure. Operation Romantic Holiday Thunder is a go. After tonight, Gina and Pete... - We call ourselves Gite. - Ooh. No. Gina and Pete will be back together, and everything will be back to normal. Let's hope this works. No. No hoping. Wish. [Drea whispering] There's Addie. Get ready. Addie? Thank you for coming. I was just so happy you called. I haven't heard from you in forever. I saw you yesterday. Yeah. Where have you been? Okay. Listen, Pete. I need you to do something for me. I would do anything for you. I know. Um, wait here. I'll wait forever for you. Mm-hmm. [chuckling, humming] Okay. There she is. Gina. [Pete] Of course. I saved this dance for you. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. [clearing throat] And lights. Gina? Petey. What are you doing here? I'm here to see you. And music. [flamenco guitar playing] Is this our song? I missed you, Petey. Have you missed me? Your dress. From the night we got engaged. Yes, it is. And wish. [Sam] Come on. Come on. [Addie] It looks like it's working. - [Sam] Yep. - Oh, it's definitely working. - Aw. - Yes.

I think you two would hit it off. Oh, Pete. If Gina is so wonderful, don't you think that maybe you made a mistake breaking up with her? No. [sighing] Okay, then. I'll see you tomorrow. Good night, Pete. Addie? I heard you talking. Are you all right? Oh, dear. Come inside. And then she said I ruined her life, and some other things that were as inventive as they were unrepeatable, and then she left. That sounds just awful. The worst part is, she's right. I have ruined everything. And I don't know how to fix it. Have you told him how you feel? [scoffs] Pete is oblivious. It's like talking to a brick wall. I wasn't talking about Pete. I could barely talk to Sam before all of this. After everything that's happened, I can't tell him the truth. He'll know it was all my fault. It's hopeless. Oh, Addie. I know everything seems hopeless. But it's Christmastime. It's a season of miracles. You can't give up yet. I can't see how this can get any better. But that's what a miracle is, dear: the promise of hope in a hopeless situation. You just give it until Christmastime. You'll see. Tomorrow is Christmas Eve. That is not a lot of time. Sometimes miracles don't need a lot of time. They just need you to believe in them. Thank you, Mrs. Motley. Oh, good night, dear. You hang in there, and remember what I said. Things will come around right. I don't see how. Oh, have a little faith. Christmastime might still have a couple of surprises for you yet. Oh, I think I see one now. - Good night, Sam. - Good night, Mrs. Motley. Hey. Hey. I was wondering where you were. Oh, just trying to find some hope in a hopeless situation. You okay? No. Listen. I know things have been rocky, but I wanted to tell you that I really respect what you tried to do tonight. It takes guts to fix a mistake. I admire you for trying. Thanks, Sam. Speaking of mistakes, you know this whole Pete thing, it started... Uh, it's starting to get old. But thanks for your help. Hey. Anything for true love, right? So, I guess I'll see you tomorrow, huh? Tomorrow? Yeah. The Donner Legacy Foundation party. [Addie] Oh, of course. You're still going? [Sam] I wouldn't miss it. Mostly because I'd probably be fired if I did. Hmm? [Sam] Anyway, good night, Addie. [Addie] Good night, Sam. Uh-huh. DJ? Sound check is in a couple hours. Catering? I just spoke with them. They had a minor scheduling issue, but they brought in temps. It's going to be great. So, we might actually pull this off? Of course we will. We always do. We didn't last night. Well, last night wasn't a party. - Last night was... - ...a disaster. A giant disaster. Speaking of which, it's Christmas Eve. What about Pete? Well, I'm trying to remember what Mrs. Motley said about faith and hope. Good for you. Yeah. Inside, I'm just having a full-on panic attack. How are things looking for tonight? We just went through the final checklist, Mr. Doyle. We're all set. Good. Mr. Donner will be here real soon. Everything is under control, sir. Okay. That's true, right? Yes, Addie. Maybe in our normal lives outside of work we're a mess. But right here in this room tonight, we've got this. [chuckling] Gina? Addie? [both] What are you doing here? [both] I'm working. This is my party. I planned it. Well, I picked up a shift to pay for the eight dozen white gardenias I won't have at my wedding. Oh, no. [caller ID] Addie Anderson. Hi, Addie. How's it going? Hi, Mrs. Motley. Addie? Take a deep breath. [sniffling] Now, tell me what's on your mind. Um, well, you know what they say. Be careful what you wish for. Oh, Addie. All this about wishes and miracles, they're all tied into joy and hope... ...and the best things in life. Then why haven't I figured this out yet? No matter what I do, Pete hasn't changed at all. Everything that's happened to you has happened for a reason. You're right. Maybe it's not Pete that needs to change at all. Oh, Addie. You've got this. Thanks, Mrs. Motley. Good night, sweetheart. Hey, Addie. Sam. Uh, this is an amazing room. Yeah. I think Drea and I might have actually pulled it off. - I think you did. - [laughing] - I wanted to talk to you. - Oh. I see my boss. I'd better go show my face. - I'll come find you. - Sure. You look beautiful, by the way. [chuckling] Addie. Great party, ladies. Even Mr. Donner is enjoying himself. Seriously. I've never seen the man that happy. I think you two should start making plans to travel abroad next Christmas. Thank you, Mr. Doyle. That could not have gone better. The only thing standing between us and the Wagner-Robinson wedding in Rome is 60 uneventful minutes. What could go wrong? Excuse me. Sad Christmas store girl? [Addie] Gina, please. This is a very important event for us. Can we just be civil for the next 60 minutes? Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize. I wouldn't want to do anything to... [in raised voice] ruin your life the way you ruined mine. Maybe that wasn't the best approach, Addie. Noted. I'll buy your gardenias. Roses. You said gardenias earlier. Changed my mind. I want roses. That's gonna cost twice as much and you're not even gonna use them. Right. I wouldn't want to do anything to inconvenience you! Okay, fine. I'll buy roses. Fine. Long-stemmed. Crystal vases. Come on. Long-stemmed. Crystal vases. Get out of here. Crisis averted. [chuckling] 58 more minutes. Addie? Oh, hey, Sam. - Hi. - [both] Hi. You invited Pete? - [both laughing] - No. What are you talking about? Pete's not here. Are you sure? Because... [sighing] You know, maybe you should quit saying the thing about counting down the minutes. I swear I didn't invite him, Sam. I thought you said you weren't together. We're not together. You have to... Addie, I'm sorry, but... I can't do this. Sam! [mic feeding back] Hello, everyone, and welcome to this lovely event my Addie has planned. I am here as your ho-ho-ho host, your holly-jolly host. The rebel without a Claus. Ha! Ba-dum-boomp. [snapping fingers] [crowd groaning, chattering] I do believe that tonight is a Claus for celebration. Ha-ha! Ha. I thought we decided not to go with the sad comedian. - Shenanigans. - The wedding. [both] Rome! Well, tonight, I'd like to celebrate my Addie, by singing a Christmas song. That is not necessary at all. Just a short Christmas song.

[chuckling] I'll just take that microphone back now, thanks. Oh. Just one little last surprise. Oh, we don't need any more surprises. I know I sure don't. The last time we tried this, we got interrupted. These last two weeks, you've shown me what true love really is. And I want to spend the rest of my life with you. [attendees murmuring] [Pete] Now, I went and took back that ring that you hated and got one that I think you'll like. I never said that. That's not actually what happened at all. [sighing] Oh, dear. Addie, will you marry me? No. You know, the theme of tonight's party is "make a wish for Christmas," and that's actually been the theme of my life for the last few days. So, tonight, Pete, I actually have a wish for you. I wish you could see how much Gina loves you. How perfect you are together. The way her eyes sparkle when she sees you. And the way you smile when you talk about her. The way she's put her whole life into planning your wedding and future. And how broken her heart has been these past few days. And to everyone in this room, I wish you all the courage to tell the people close to you how you really feel about them. Whether it's your best friend... your fiancé... ...or even your next-door neighbour. Even if you're scared. Even if you're not sure if they feel the same. Because making a wish, even making a wish for Christmas, it's not enough. You have to tell them, because you don't know what you might be losing if you don't. Now, I can't live this past week over again. But I hope that next time... No. No, I have faith... ...that I won't make the same mistake again. And I wish the same for all of you. Thank you so much for coming tonight. Uh, the gift bags are at the door. [sighing] [crowd chuckling] [attendees murmuring] That was a beautiful speech. What are you doing? Cancelling all our reservations for Rome. Drea, I'm so sorry that everything worked out like this. Addie, Drea... Mr. Doyle, um, about tonight, Drea had nothing to do with it. It was all me. Addie, I'm surprised. It's not like you - to take full credit. - Credit? Mr. Donner loved your little speech. He called his son and he invited him home for Christmas. They're on the phone right now. Well done, ladies. It's the best Donner party ever. [chuckling] Well, that's not saying much. What are you doing now? Rebooking. [laughing] Mrs. Motley was right. It's a Christmas miracle. [Pete] Addie? Gina and I have decided to go ahead with the wedding. I know this is painful. Let's not say any more. I'd invite you, but... I told him not to. I understand. I hope we can stay friends. Okay. That's long enough. [clearing throat] I'm sorry to break your heart during Christmas. I promise in time, you'll get over it. I promise. I'm actually happy for them. Yeah. Now she doesn't have to work at that weird Christmas store. [giggling] Well, that was the greatest party. It was. I guess we'll talk after Christmas. To plan Rome. [both squealing] Merry Christmas, Addie. Merry Christmas, Drea. - Sam? - Hi. You're still here. Yeah. There was a long line at the coat check. So... So, you... I heard everything. Did you really mean that? About your next-door neighbour? Yeah, I did. I wish I'd told him how much I like him. That I think he's kind... ...and handsome. And makes a mean reindeer cookie. And I love the way that he thinks of others, in everything he does and... the way he is. And I love the way that every day, he makes me want to be a better version of myself. I really wish I'd had the courage to tell him that. Well, I have it on good authority that he made some similar wishes about you. Did he? - Yeah. - Hmm. He wishes he told you how beautiful you are, and how kind. And how he loves that you love the holidays, and how you're always doing things for people. Baking muffins... ...and volunteering. And he loves how he feels when he's around you. It's like Christmas. And there's something that... he wishes he did a long time ago. What's that? ♪ ♪ I guess it's true. What is?
