Sam and I just love this place. You really make it feel like a home away from home. Thanks. We try. [doorbell rings] New arrivals. Excuse me. ♪ Thank you. ♪ Welcome to the Blue Spruce Inn. You must be the Roth family. That's us. I'm Mark, this is Erin, and this is Emma. Say hi, Emma. Hi. Hi Emma. I'm Averie. Thank you for having us. You... you look familiar. Yeah, I was just thinking the same thing. I get that a lot. I must just have one of those faces. Anyway, it's so great to have you guys here. All the way from Texas, right? Yes, ma'am. Emma has always wanted a white Christmas. And this year, we could finally make it happen. Well, you picked a great town for it. And it just so happens we have the best Christmas festival around. Really? Yeah, come with me. So, the Yuletide Festival dates back to the 1940's. It started as a way to cheer folks up when times were hard. And now, no matter what happens during the year, everyone comes together to celebrate and be thankful. Ah, sounds like a wonderful tradition. Where is it held? Each year, the town votes on which local business has the honour of hosting. This year it's the Phillips' farm. Oh, have you ever hosted it here? -I haven't been that lucky yet. -Hmm. Oh, this is for you. Thank you. And this is for you. Pick one. Thank you! You're welcome. Enjoy your stay at the Blue Spruce Inn. [jazzy Christmas tune] ♪ Merry Christmas! Oh. [chuckles] You like that smell? I do too. Your dog is adorable. Yeah, and doesn't he know it. [laughs] Wait, do I know you? Uh, no, I don't think so. Yeah, you're that singer, right? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Jesse Collins, nice to meet you. Oh. I loved your music. You used to sing with that woman. Yeah. What's her name? Well, it's been a while. I've been a solo act since then. Had a show in Brighton last night. Oh, wish I knew. I would've been there. Hope it went well. It went great. Thanks man. Merry Christmas. You too. Oh, thanks. ♪ Ready to hit the road, buddy? Concerts wait for no dog, huh? We are out of gingerbread men. New batch, coming right up. The guests love them. They're going faster than... Hotcakes? Got those too. Susie, you are a whirling dervish of culinary delight. Well the festival has really drawn a crowd this year. I know, I can't wait to build a few more cottages. I don't want to turn people away. Oh. Someone thinks that's a good idea. She's kicking. Can't wait to meet her. Me neither. But this little angel better not make her debut until after Christmas like she's supposed to. You hear me? After Christmas. Averie? Thank goodness I found you. Something terrible has happened. Hey Arnold. Did somebody spike the town fountain with bubbles again? No, but there was water involved. Phillips Farms are setting up for the festival, and an irrigation pipe burst. The whole place is flooded. Oh no, that really is terrible. Yeah. Well, the farm's going to be fine, thank goodness. But everything for the festival is underwater, so they can't possibly host anymore. And less than a week away. This is a complete disaster. Can we help? Well, actually, that's why I'm here. Would you consider hosting the Yuletide Festival? Here, at the Blue Spruce Inn? I know it's short notice, but... [together] Yes! Oh, I'm so happy you said that. The town council, we had an emergency meeting, and everyone voted you their top choice. This is such an honour. I always thought we could host a wonderful festival here. Look, we're still assessing the cost of the flooding, but I'm sure we'll have enough funds left to cover your expenses. Great, and we certainly have enough space on the in-grounds. We're going to have all the greatest hits. We're going to have snowmen and horse-drawn carriage rides, and fun Christmas activities. And cookies galore. I knew I could count on you two. You're sure this isn't too much? It's only six days away, you must be busy as it is. No, we've got a great team here to help us. Great! I'll be in touch. Six days. Wow! There you are, Averie. Hi, Honey. Hi. There's a Miss Selig here to see you. She says it's important. Oh. Okay, well, I'd better go. This is so exciting. The Yuletide Festival comes to the Blue Spruce Inn! Wow. Did you hear? What? I know. I'll tell you all about it. Come on, help me. Hi. Averie Davis. Oh. Phyllis Selig from World Passage Magazine. Oh. Oh! I submitted the Blue Spruce... ...For consideration for our top winter lodge award, yes. That was months ago. I never heard anything. Well, you can now consider your inn officially in the running. That's great. Yes, of course, I did register under a nom de plume, you see I didn't want to tip you off. Although I do suppose I'm... I'm tipping you off now. But then again I'm so unconventional that way. Besides, I mean, who doesn't like unannounced guests over the holidays? The more the merrier. That's very sweet. Uh, could we sit? Sure. Now, as I'm sure you already know, the top winter lodge award comes with great acclaim and exposure, not to mention the $60,000 prize. Well let's just make sure you love it here. Mm-hmm. I will be staying for the week, and I'll assess everything the inn has to offer to ensure that it and you are worthy. Well, Phyllis... Ms. Selig. Sorry, Ms. Selig. You picked a great week to stay here. It just so happens we're hosting the annual Yuletide Festival. Hmm. That sounds like an awful lot of work. Oh no, we host events here all the time. Well, you don't want to be pulled in different directions and overextend yourself. I can handle it. [laughs weakly] You may find this helpful. Uh, the former top winter lodge award winners, they had complete dedication to the running of their establishment. I mean, that was their entire focus. [sighs] All right, okay. Well. Do make sure that you continue on with your daily routine, because you will not even know that I'm here. But if I might ask, could I have a cup of tea if it's not too much trouble? Of course, what kind? Green. Great. Oh, but not Jasmine. Mint. Oh, and nothing too robust. Something maybe... sprightly. [giggles] You know, I'm really not picky, so you can just surprise me. [laughs] Ah. [gasps] Ha! One cup of sprightly green tea, coming right up. You just couldn't resist, could you? Nope. So you heard? Yes, that's amazing. We're in the running. I know. And if we win, we could get a head start on those cottages. You don't think we're taking on too much at once, do you? With the festival and the critic at the same time? No, I'll help plan the festival. That way you can focus on Ms. Selig, and the inn. Oh no, you're so... I feel fine. Healthy as a horse. Plus, I'll delegate. Don't forget my husband is our handyman. That's true. Well, here goes nothing. Oh, wait. Oh. Right. The tea. [sighs] Thank you. [sighs] [claps] Got a feeling it's going to be another great show. You know what? Me too. You know, it feels good to get back to my roots with these small town tours. Drum up a little enthusiasm, boost sales. Show the label you still got it. Exactly. And you know, it's good promotion for when I turn in my new album. You still writing up a storm? Yep. You know, it looks like I'm going to meet the top of the year deadline after all. Listen, Jesse. Um, look, you've been working non-stop. It might not be such a bad idea to take a little R&R for the holidays. [laughs] Oh, you're serious? Uh-huh. No. No. Why would I do that? Well you're cooped up on a bus all day long with me and a dog. How you gonna write songs about life and love if you aren't out there experiencing it? Well, did that once. You know how that turned out. Ready? Besides, listen to that. I've got their love to get me through. Ladies and Gentlemen, please welcome recording star, Mr. Jesse Collins. [loud cheering and applause] [bell jingles] ♪ Oh, there she is! Hey guys. Sorry I'm late. Marshall, thank you so much for helping out. You kidding? When Susie told me about you guys hosting, I couldn't wait to get started. Six days isn't much, but we can get it done. Okay. So, we laid everything out so you can see where it can go. (Averie) This is great. And I made a list of everything that needs to be done so we can keep track. Horse-drawn carriages, snowmen... And snow-women and children. Speaking of which, I thought of a way how we could jazz things up. Instead of just snowman building, we could have a snowman decorating contest. Ahh. Best gets the prize? Cookies. [laughs] Of course. Okay, so. Snowmen can go here. Then we can put the hot chocolate station, ornament painting, and stocking embroidery over here. Concessions over here, the horse-drawn carriages... Santa's Village? Santa's Village. Of course! With sleighs and pres... presents... Woah. Susie. I, I think I just got a little carried away. Are you okay? You look a little flushed. I'm fine. There's nothing to worry about, it just got a little overexcited. Thanks, Doc. So I... I can get back to planning? Not so fast. Now, you're due right after Christmas and you're already busy at the inn. But... Doctor's orders. Hmm. Thank you. Mm. [laughs] I'm sorry, Averie. I really wanted to help. You already have. Don't worry, babe. I'll be there. Exactly. We got this. While running the inn and impressing the critic? No worries. Leave it to me. Okay. Then you'll need the list. Honey, pass me the list. It details all the to-dos for the festival, and you won't even have to check it twice, because I already have. Thanks, Susie. Yeah, and I've got a couple of construction guys who'd be happy to help. I'll start on the stage tomorrow. What stage? Oh. Did I not mention that? No. It's on the list. How about we have some live holiday musical entertainment? That's a great idea. Who'd you have in mind? Well, I do know this great singer. Here. You need to see her in action. Oh no, not this. ♪ It's you, yeah, it's you ♪ You're kidding, right? Averie, you had a No. 1 holiday hit. Years ago. But you're still so good. Look, I stepped away from all that for a reason. Honey, help me out here. I am not getting involved. Oh, come on. Think how special it would be if Averie Davis took the stage for one night only, and sang "It Wouldn't Be Christmas." "It Wouldn't be Christmas" is a duet. Then sing something else. You guys were all over the radio. Look, you said yourself, you sometimes wonder if you shouldn't have given music up. It doesn't matter anyway. I'm not singing. And Jesse Collins is the last person I want to think about this Christmas. [applause] Thank you. Thank you so much. Uh, you've been an amazing crowd. Thank you for having me. (Female fan) Sing "It Wouldn't Be Christmas." What was that? "It Wouldn't Be Christmas!" Oh, uh... No, I can't... can't do that one. That's a duet.

There's so much to do on this list... And only five days to do it. When I have a big project, I just start with the essentials, like with a building I'd start with a foundation. Christmas trees. You can't have a Yuletide festival without Christmas trees. There you go. [Christmas ringtone] Oh, this is my parents. Do you mind? No. I'll give Mr. Hutch's Christmas Tree Farm a call? Thanks! Hi Mom, Hi Dad. Hey. Hi, honey. We are just thrilled that you're going to be hosting the festival. Wait, where'd you hear that? Susie just texted us. I knew she wouldn't last five minutes. And she told us about the award. Congratulations, honey. That's huge. Well, I haven't won it yet, I still have to impress the critic they sent. Wait, what's that noise I'm hearing? Oh, it's just your father trying to shut the suitcase. Can't very well bring the Florida beach weather with us. Guess what your father heard at the grocery store. "Move your cart, you're in my way." What? No! "It Wouldn't Be Christmas." Patty. You weren't supposed to say anything. You know Averie doesn't like to talk about the song. It's fine, Rob. Averie's fine with it. Aren't you, honey? You're fine with it? Not as if I mentioned Jesse... You guys know I can hear you, right? Well, we don't want to keep you, honey. I hope you're not too overwhelmed with all the work. No, I can handle it as long as nothing else arrives to distract me. [doorbell rings] Oh. New guests. I gotta go, but call me when you get to the airport, okay? Love you. Love you too. Love you sweets, love you. Hi. Jesse? Averie? (Simultaneously) What are you doing here? When did you... How did you... What? Let's... let's start over. Hi, Jesse. Hi, Averie. What are you doing here? What are you doing here? I asked first. Right, no, I'm uh, I'm on tour. I have a show in Richfield tomorrow. I guess my team booked me here. What about you? What... what, uh, how long... how long are you staying? Oh, I'm staying for a while actually. Through the holidays? Like, forever. I own the place. With my partner, Susie. You own this place? Hold on, little miss stop the bus, I need to bask in the rays to what, Swiss Chalet? People change. I always pictured what you might be up to, but... Never thought this. Beats chasing the spotlight. Cool yeah, I mean maybe for you. Uh, you can't beat the open road. [bitterly] I did. How's that going for you? I'm sorry. No, no, I'm... I'm sorry. Um, we shouldn't do this here. This is too... [dog barks] Averie. Dan. Rowdy! I remember when you were a puppy, we rescued you. You still look like a puppy. That makes one of us. Aw. Haven't had that Averie Davis energy around to keep me young. Well, you look great. I can't believe you guys are still touring together. I know, right? So, what are you doing here? Well, actually, she owns the place. Well, what a happy coincidence. Is that how we would describe it? Maybe a little differently. I'll take that. I'm going to go get the rest of our stuff. But after that, you are going to tell me how in the world you ended up running an inn out here? Come on Rowdy, come on. Good boy. So. Show me around. Sure. And this is the kitchen. Oh, Averie, I just got a call from... Jesse Collins? I love you! Loved you. Past tense. I mean I still love you. Love your music, that is. I... I was your biggest fan. I am! Present tense! Not biggest because I'm pregnant. Susie. This is Susie, our baker and co-owner of the Blue Spruce. And I believe she has a message for me. Oh, right. The Christmas Tree farm called. They're ready for you to go and pick out whichever trees you want. Great, okay. I have to run, but you're welcome to stay here, if you want. Well, I can stay somewhere else if this is too... Everywhere else in town is booked up because of the Yuletide Festival, which I am now hosting. Long story. But yeah. Wait! Jesse, you... you have to go with her. She'll need help carrying the trees. So heavy. Oh, look, I'm fine. Um, Jesse's busy, he has a gig tonight. Right. No, I... Huge deadline with the album label, gotta turn it in, only here for one night, you know, uh... So I should probably get to my room. That's right. But you can't... The room. The room isn't ready yet. Yeah, just wall to wall mess. And mice, so many mice. Mice? There are mice in this hotel? Ms. Selig, no. Susie was just kidding, it's all a big joke. Right, Susie? [laughing awkwardly] Yes, a joke. I'm joking. I... I wasn't joking about those Christmas trees being heavy. I would help carry them, but in my condition... All right. Looks like I'm gonna be hauling some Christmas trees. [gasps] Great. Too skinny, too small... This tree is perfect. And this tree. Uh, you know, might I suggest maybe smaller trees, since I am your muscle? Don't tell me you've gone soft. What? No, no. You know what it is, really? I'm having flashbacks of me carrying all of your suitcases on our first cross country tour. It was one suitcase. I remember it being a little bit more. Okay, well maybe it was packed a little heavy, but a girl's gotta have a costume change. Hmm. So uh, where are you spending Christmas? Uh, on the road. Just been too busy the past couple of years for it, honestly. But you always loved Christmas. Yeah look, I gotta ask. Why an inn, and why this town, of all places? What did you imagine me doing? Parasailing in Argentina? Tracking the Serengeti? Or, you know. Sneaking into my concerts, hiding out in the crowd. Ha. You wish. [chuckles] You know, funny thing. Uh, sometimes I would look out into the crowd and think that I saw your face. But then I realized that it wasn't you. So I hear you've been having fun since going solo. Me? No. Wait, from who? Oh, you know. Pops up on the internet. [laughs] Well, you know, one of the perks of not having a hit single in a while? Uh, people tend to leave you alone. Oh yeah. That's true. It's nice being under the radar, not having people pick your life apart. So, what about you? You, uh, you find someone to settle down with? Oh no, I've just been busy. Just like... [clears throat] Right. And what about you? Me? Yeah, just busy, just... Uh, plus I don't like to be in one place too long. Hmm. [Christmas ringtone] Hello? Tell me everything. Is it as romantic as I'm imagining? We're picking out Christmas trees. Can't a girl dream? I know this isn't why you called me. Ooh. Right. The critic, Ms. Selig. She's in the lobby. She looks displeased. I offered her snickerdoodles, but she didn't want any. What kind of person doesn't want snickerdoodles? Oh no. I forgot I told her I'd give her an interview at noon. Okay, tell her I'll be right there. Okay. Huh. I have to go, uh... but we need a dozen more trees. Oh no, no. Go, go. I got this. Really? I got this. Pick big ones. [laughs] The biggest. [sighs] Ooh. Do you have anything a little less sprightly? Perhaps something calm like tall grass on a summer's evening? Tall grass. Of course. You got your work cut out for you with that one. I'm so sorry I'm late. I imagine you were pretty busy with inn requests? Actually, I was picking out trees for the festival. Oh, I see. So, uh, tell me, how did you come up with the name the Blue Spruce for your inn? The blue spruce is my favourite tree. Not just because they're beautiful, but they're unique. They have shallow roots, but they can withstand strong winds. Reminds me of when I was performing and then I moved here and I found my roots. Ah, what a beautiful story. And what about the inspiration for your inn? Well, when I was touring, I would stay in one hotel after another, so I wanted to create a place that reminded me of what I missed. A place that felt like a home away from home. That's lovely. And I want you to feel that too. Averie! Averie. A terrible thing has happened. Again. Terrible things? More than one? My friend here loves to exaggerate. Oh. Excuse us a moment. Arnold. What's wrong? Well, I know I said we'd have enough funds left, uh, but there's been a miscalculation. What kind of miscalculation? Uh, well, there's less money than we thought. How much less? Uh, none. [loudly] What! [whispers] How? Well, there were a lot of unexpected costs due to the flooding and um, we might have to cancel. We can't cancel the festival. Well I've talked with the town council, they've looked at the budgets, and unfortunately they agree. I just don't see any other option. Do you? [sighs] Five days to pull this off, and no way to pay for it? I just don't want to let people down. You know, when I was singing, what I loved about the music was that it brought people together. That's what I love about the festival, it brings our town together. Look at them, they would've been perfect to sing on the stage. Yeah, but you would've been better. And you and Jesse together? You would've been the best. Since he's here, after all... Here for one night.

I mean, I don't need my back for anything, you know. (Announcer) Come around everyone for our annual Christmas tree lighting. Now, as some of you may know, uh, our Yuletide Festival has had a couple of hiccups. And um, well, Averie and Susie of the Blue Spruce Inn had generously agreed to save the day and help host the festivities. But, um... Well, it seems that after almost 80 years, our Yuletide Festival is going to be... Better than ever. That's right. This year's going to be extraordinary. There's something special about our town, right? (Averie) We come together to help each other out. Well, after what happened at the Phillips' farm, we lost all of our funding. So we're asking that people donate decorations or supplies, if you have them on hand. We got some extra lumber down at the yard, if... if you need to build anything. I can donate hot chocolate from my shop. The community players have a bunch of set pieces and props left over from our Santa's spectacular. (Averie) Oh, that's great. Thank you all so much. This is what Christmas spirit is all about. [applause] Averie, I knew you were the right person to host. And so, for keeping the lights on, why don't you do the honours? [cheering and applause] [laughs] ♪ Thank you all so much for helping. We've got to work fast. I think we're actually going to pull this off. Thank you, Averie. We're just... we're just happy you asked us to get involved. Well, let me show you the plans. This will be Santa's village, and... Could you... Actually, Marshall will walk you through the plans. I'll be back in a moment. Ms. Selig. Did you sleep well? Wonderfully. The bed was very comfortable. But I was hoping to have my breakfast tea on the porch listening to my favourite classical station, but this noise is... We're just beginning construction for the festival. The whole town is chipping in. Why don't I have our kitchen whip you up a special breakfast? Susie is famous for her boysenberry buttermilk flapjacks. I'm just not sure... They're not even on the menu. I could have them made specially for you, and brought straight to your cottage, have the fireplace lit up, doesn't that sound lovely? I suppose it does. Thank you. [exhales] [phone notification] Hey. Headed off already? Yeah. Uh, I was looking for you, actually. I gotta head out if I'm gonna make it to my next show. Of course. I wish I had more time, but I don't. I mean, you know how it is. Guitars and gigs. Oh, don't I know it. Do you really not miss it? Do you really still love it? Merry Christmas, Averie. Merry Christmas, Jessie. ♪ Hear my favourite song come on ♪ ♪ and every word reminds me this is true ♪ ♪ Me and you ♪ [laughs] All right, all right. Focus. Just... Focus. No you gotta focus, you gotta make... Just wanted to check and see how you're doing since Jesse left. Well, it was great to have him here. But it's best that he left, because I need to focus. Then why were you watching that video? I heard it from outside. It's just something Jesse said. He asked if I miss performing, and I don't. So after Ridgefield tonight, we got a tight turnaround before Simsbury. But we can make it work, and then we're off to... Hey, Jesse. You listening? Oh. What's on your mind? It's nothing. It's just something Averie said. She asked if I still love performing. And do you? Of course. Music's my dream. Well, my dream used to be Christie, then Margaret. We know how those turned out. You know what they say. Third time's a charm. I'm holding out hope. [Christmas ringtone] Hi Mom, hi Dad. Are you in DC? Hi Mr. and Mrs. Davis. You ready for the cold weather? Hi Susie. Hi, honey. We sure are. But there's a really big storm rolling into the northeast. All flights are grounded. No. Any word on when it's gonna clear up? No, nothing yet. But we'll figure something out. We wouldn't miss Christmas with you. Okay, well call me if you hear anything else. Of course, honey. We will. Mwah. Bye! Bye. Hey. Don't worry, I'm sure they'll make it. But if it heads our way. [sighs] All right, let's go chase those dreams. Your dreams may not be changing, but uh, our travel plans might be. What do you mean? Roads are closed. Storm rolled in just south of us. We're not going to make it to the next town, let alone the next show. That's great. Okay, Santa's Village, let's bring you to life. Oh. Mr. and Mrs. Roth from Texas. I see Marshall's taking good care of you? Oh yes. This basket is wonderful. I can put it in your room for you. They were just asking me why you look so familiar. It's gonna come to me, I know it. Uh, we're just off to town for some Christmas shopping. Does the inn have a daycare? Emma's with Susie right now. We can definitely arrange something. I think I have a better idea. Have you seen our Santa's Village? Not yet. I think the elves may need help decorating. Oh, she would love that. And there's a special way to get there. They're very tall. I've only ever been on a pony. Well, just think of them as big ponies. Besides, look at that sweet face. Hey, he nibbled me. That means he likes you. Come on. It's like we're on Santa's sleigh. That's the idea. See, it's fun. Just wait till the kids back in Texas hear about this. Mikey's gonna be real jealous. Who's Mikey? He's a boy in my class, and he left a ladybug on my desk and said I was his girlfriend. And that's gross. Well relationships are complicated. Hey, Averie. Hold up. What are you doing back? The snowstorm blocked the roads. So. Does that mean he can help us decorate Santa's Village? You bet I can. The only way to get there is the carriage ride. Right. I happen to be a natural around horses, so. Careful. Woah. Sorry. That's okay. Are you Averie's boyfriend? Uh, well... I haven't introduced you two. Emma, Jesse. Jesse, Emma. Hi. Hi. So, Emma. Uh, which way to Santa's Village? That way. Okay. Looks like a village fit for Santa himself. Mr. Vigneau, thank you so much for donating all of this. Well, this is all just gathering dust in theatre storage. And not the good kind of dust where it floats through the spotlight to set the scene of a dark and stormy night. No, just the filthy kind of dust that we have to clean. Enjoy. Oh. So, um, I was wondering if Dan and I could stay here until the storm blows over. You're in luck. Your cottage just so happens to still be available. Great. One condition. Always a catch. Well, seeing as how you're so good at decorating trees, I can only imagine how good you are at all kinds of Christmas decorating. Okay. The festival's in four days. Well, that is four days I could spend writing. But who will help Emma decorate her snowmen for the snowman decorating competition? Please? Well, how can I say no to that? Deal. Relationships are complicated. [small laugh] You're enjoying this way more than I expected. Yeah, I don't know. I guess I forgot how much fun Christmas can be. You used to be all about it. No matter what city we were in over the holidays. What changed? I don't know, just I got busy. Focused on other things. Right. Music. How's your album coming along? Good. Just, you know, writing a lot. Any hits in there? No, I don't... I don't think so. Why not? It's just... The songs are all scattered. There's not really anything tying them together. Let's, uh, keep that between us and the snowman. Scout's honour. You on the other hand, never had a problem writing. In fact, you were great at it. You could do it all. I could do the music. Then it started to be all about touring and getting bigger and doing more. Yeah. All the stuff that I loved about it, the, uh, unpredictability, the hustle. That's when it stopped being fun for me. And then we kinda lost touch, and now we are standing right next to each other. Snowball fight. Hey! I'm being attacked right now! [laughing] You too? Wait a second. Wait, I surrender, I surrender! Oh, okay. I give up. [Christmas ringtone] Hello? Averie, there's been a terrible emergency in the kitchen. You have to come back. A terrible emergency? Ms. Selig, I was just bringing you a complementary gift basket. Oh. [laughs] [sighs] Averie. Okay, what's wrong? What's going on? Jesse, is that you? I'd recognize that voice anywhere. Yeah, no it's me. Uh, roads are shut down. Oh, thank goodness. I mean, not about the roads, thank goodness you're back. Not that I was hoping you'd be back or anything. Susie. You called about a terrible emergency in the kitchen? With all the extra baking for the Yuletide Festival, I didn't realize how much flour and sugar and spices we'd gone through. I'm out of practically everything. I wouldn't call that an emergency. I haven't got a single vanilla bean to extract. Allspice? Try no spice! I don't have Confectioner's sugar, or Turbinado sugar, or Demerara sugar, or muscovado sugar. Try saying that three times fast. And I need to make all the cookies for Christmas Day. Shouldn't you be resting anyway? Ha! Tell her that. It's like she's running a judo class in there. Okay. I'm going to send a runner to town to get you everything you need. Great. Wait, but not Allen. Last time, he got artificial vanilla instead of the real thing. Got it. Oh, and not Lina. She confuses baking powder and baking soda. Okay. Oh, and definitely not Armando. He always get me... Hello, hello. Oh, Ms. Selig. He- Oh, hello. Hey. That was a lovely basket, Averie. Thank you so much. Of course. And I also wanted to compliment the chef on those amazing pancakes yesterday. Thanks. Now what's this I hear about you running out of ingredients and the staff running amuck? Oh, no. It's just the holiday festivities have us a little low on stock. It's nothing. Right. You know, a well-run kitchen is the mark of a well-run property. I have to go to town to pick the hot chocolate. I will go run and get everything you need. I know exactly what you want, anyway. But you're so busy as it is. It's fine. No, I'll go with you. Oh. Thanks, but you don't have to. Did I hear you mention something about hot chocolate? You know I checked, and the storm was supposed to skirt us. But look at those clouds. What is Susie doing, feeding the whole town? Basically, yes. Susie grew up here, so she wants everything to be perfect. Oh. So she's from here, but you still haven't told me why you decided to move here. Can't I just love living in a quaint little town? Guess so. Kind of mysterious. Although, it is kind of odd. I feel like I've been here before. Averie, oh Averie. Hey. Averie, I have heard excellent things about how everything is coming along. Thanks, yeah, we're right on schedule. Oh, and great show in Brighton the other night, Jesse. Sounds like you've still got it. Thanks. Have you ever considered doing breathing exercises though, to extend your vocal range? See, I happen to be an excellent singer myself, so... Arnold. You wouldn't want to overwork your voice with all the festival speeches you'll be giving. Right, of course. Well, I'll see you later. Bye-bye. [laughs] Oh no. It's starting to snow. We need to get to Miss Edith's. Well, shouldn't we just head back to the inn? No. We'll be quick. Miss Edith makes the best hot chocolate. You are in for a treat. You caught me right in time. I was just about to close up. Thank you for donating the hot chocolate. Mm-hmm. I think we're going to go with the semi-sweet. That's my favourite too. I'll make it up fresh the day of the festival. Great. Can't have Christmas without hot chocolate. This is amazing. Yeah, well, that has to beat cold coffee from a gas station. That it definitely does. And in fact, if you really wanted to give the people a kick... All right, hear me out. You could let them personalize it. So not just a hot chocolate station, but a hot chocolate bar with mix and match flavours. That's a great idea, Jesse. I know. ♪ It wouldn't be Christmas, ♪ ♪ it wouldn't be Christmas. ♪ Hey, Miss Edith, would you mind changing the station? But that's your song, hun. Yeah. Heard it one time too many? This time of year, that's putting it mildly. ♪ Hear my favourite song come on and every word... ♪ I don't blame you. "It Wouldn't Be Christmas" is still the most requested song at all my concerts. I avoid our song as much as I can. Wait, really? Yeah, I don't listen to our music. Like, any of them? Well, no. Do you? They don't mean anything to you? I... I assumed that you'd feel the same way I do. Our music just brings up old history. Right. Our history, Averie. Right, but it's... Fine. We should, we should get back to the inn. Oh my, would you look at it come down. Oh, no. Festival decorations, I have to go. Oh, best wait till the storm lets up. (Radio) And here's a little chestnut we never get tired of, from our favourite holiday duo, Averie and Jesse. ♪ It wouldn't be Christmas ♪ ♪ Without you ♪ ♪ Evenings by the fireside ♪ ♪ But all I'm really thinking about is you ♪ You've gotta be kidding me. Stop breathing. You're breathing too heavy, you're trying to knock it over, it's not going to work. Here we go. Boom. Looks like I'm knocking things down left and right today. [laughs] Look, about earlier. Uh, maybe I overreacted. No, I... No, I... I get it. It's easier to start over when you're not dwelling on the past. I didn't forget, though. I just... chose to focus on something else. Oh, thank goodness. It's letting up. Shall we? I hope the storm didn't do too much damage. No, it's all good. We've already got the pathways cleared and, uh, there was no wind out here, so everything stayed put. Great. Now that's a woman on a mission. Okay. Now that the cleanup is done, let's have some fun. Christmas cookies are next up on the list. ♪ You better watch out ♪ ♪ You better not cry ♪ ♪ You better not pout I'm telling you why ♪ ♪ 'Cause Santa Claus is coming to town, yeah. ♪ ♪ He's making a list, he's checking it twice. ♪ ♪ He's going to find out who's naughty or nice. ♪ ♪ Santa Claus is coming to town. ♪ ♪ ♪ Santa Claus is coming to town. ♪ ♪ Santa Claus is coming to town. ♪ ♪ Santa Claus is coming to town. ♪ ♪ To town. ♪ Not bad if I do say so myself. Now that's what I call teamwork. Well, thanks to our fearless leader. Move aside, Willy Wonka. There's a new confectioner in town. [laughs] Honey, those are for later. Mmm. That is the tastiest mouse I've ever had. And now, for the annual Davis tradition. You have a tradition? It's annual too. Bring your hats! So, every year before we would decorate the tree, we would gather round and share our favourite Christmas memories. Whoever had the sweetest memory would win... ...The treasure chest. What's the treasure? Just so I know how much effort I need to put out. [laughs] That is for me to know and for you to find out. But, it is very valuable. Well, what are we waiting for? Come on. Well, shouldn't we wait for your parents? Flights are still grounded. But I promised them that we wouldn't decorate the tree till they got here. I'm sure they'll make it here in time. Fingers crossed. So, who wants to go first? I've got a good Christmas memory. Oh yeah? Think you can out-sweet your sweetheart? Woah, someone's getting competitive. [laughs] Okay, honey. Let's hear it. Okay, so. I was an army brat. Always moving around, barely unpacking. To make it worse, my father got stationed overseas where we couldn't go with him. But, late December that year, I came home and our entire house was strung with Christmas lights. My dad was back. For good. That was the first place that really felt like home. Top that. Woah. Okay, I'll try. Hmm. My favourite part of Christmas is the homemade desserts. Well, no surprise there. Right? Growing up, my mom had to work away from home a lot. But every Christmas, she made time to teach me how to bake her family recipes. The ones her mother had passed down. I loved spending that time together. It's the reason I became a baker. Well, my favourite part of Christmas was not having to go to school. [laughs] No, really. On snow days, my brother would take me out sledding, but one Christmas, my brother was in the hospital. He was, um, too sick to go outside, but it wasn't that serious. But, I did the next best thing. I brought the sled to him. And the nurses, they let me drag him up and down the hallways. [laughing] Jesse, what about you? So I was 13 years old, my family gathered around the tree, and that's when I saw it. A present shaped like a guitar. I'll tell you, I played my first concert that Christmas night. And I wasn't very good. [laughing] [sighs] This is tough, but I think I'm gonna have to go with Marshall. Wait, what? This is fixed. [laughs] Blue spruce. Seeds of the blue spruce tree. Pick a place, and plant it for the little one on the way. -Thank you. -Thank you. Is there a runner up prize or anything? [laughing] Come on, Jesse. You stopped making a big deal about Christmas a long time ago. Did he ever tell you why? Because when I ask him, he just changes the subject. You know, I think there's a guitar that might need some tuning somewhere. I think I left the oven on. Yeah. I should help. Okay, let's go. Okay. Very smooth, guys. Very smooth. So. ["O Christmas Tree plays in background] Do you remember when we finally called it quits? We just finished the winter tour. You wanted to add dates to take us through the new year. And you couldn't wait to get back home to recharge. A huge fight on the bus. I tried to storm off, but... Yeah. You got about 50 feet out before you were knee-deep in snow. [laughs] That was the week before... ...Christmas. I had no idea. It's okay. The most important thing is that we're here right now. What are you doing with this? Oh, I must've grabbed the wrong box from storage. Wow. What is that jacket? Okay, first of all, we were playing at the Orpheum, and I had to play the part. I mean... I guess. Whoo. You know what, I'm pretty sure that there's a very embarrassing picture of you wearing some certain leopard pants, and I'm going to find it. Oh, nope! No, no. Come here. [laughs] [groans] Thank you. You know, I've gotta say. I'm proud of you for what you've been able to build here. You know, you asked me why this town, and why it looks familiar. We drove through here once on tour, and I thought it was the most beautiful place I'd ever seen. I've been here before. You were always just so focused on the road ahead. You really don't miss it at all? I miss parts of it. Sometimes. So. Which parts do you miss? [gasps] Oh, Jesse. Mr. and Mrs. Davis. Averie. Mom. Dad. Uh... Let's go inside. It's cold. Okay. [sighs] Hi. You made it out of DC! Why didn't you let me know? Sorry, honey. We knocked, but... Are you two back to- I thought flights were grounded. They cleared the roads enough, so we made the drive instead. Surprise! Great. Although it looks like you have a surprise for us. Jesse, what are you doing here? I will explain everything, but first let's get you two settled in. Yeah, you know. I'm going to let you guys catch up. It's good to see you, Mr. Davis. Jesse. See ya. I always knew you'd come to your senses. Yeah. Baby, how are you? Oh, honey. Hey, Jesse. You got a sec? Marshall. Yeah, uh, anything to keep me out of sight. What's going on? [laughs] Um, I came up with an idea for a Christmas present for Susie, but there's one thing I could use your help with. Yeah, of course. Marshall, this is great. You built this? Susie is going to love it. What did you need from me? Well, every mobile needs a lullaby. I'd be honoured to record something. Oh man, thanks Jesse. Susie is gonna flip. She is such a huge fan of yours. Yeah, you know, I hadn't noticed. She seems pretty enthusiastic about everything. Yup. You know, Susie's the reason I moved to this town. Oh yeah? Yeah. Yeah, we met in New York. She was, uh, leading a baking seminar, I was working on a construction project next door. She came storming over to tell me the jackhammering had made her chocolate soufflés fall. We've been together ever since. Tale as old as time. Yeah, right? Yeah. I dreamt of building skyscrapers, and she convinced me to settle down here. You gave up on your dream. Oh, no. Dreams change. I never dreamed I'd have a wife and a kid on the way. This is my dream now. Hmm. Hey. I heard your parents made it last night. They sure did. And they are hungry after their long trip. Is there something... Already one step ahead of you. Susie, you are a lifesaver. Oh, uh, did your parents see Jesse yet? Not only did they see him, they walked in on us almost kissing. What? Ooh. That's a development I totally didn't see coming. Right. And Your exits were so discreet last night. So, are you guys getting back together? One interrupted kiss doesn't mean we're getting back together. That's about as likely as us singing together again. Huh. You should've seen Averie when she was little. She used to line up her dolls... And assign them rooms based on their personalities. Mom? Dad? I don't think Ms. Selig wants to hear this. Besides, Susie just finished making some of her famous flapjacks. On the contrary. Finding out more about you provides a window into what's beyond the windows of your inn. [laughs] Now, you were saying, a dollhouse? Yes, she was so cute. She used to tell us... [sharply] Mom, Dad? How would you like to help me set up the poinsettia display? Oh honey, absolutely. Would you excuse us? Yes, of course. Enjoy. All right, lead the way. Nice to see. you. And you. Okay, let me adjust this last one... there! Beautiful. Just beautiful. I'm sure we don't need to tell you that we're so proud of you, Averie. Pulling all this together at the last minute. Well, I had a lot of help. Oh. Well, did Jesse help you? Ha. I was wondering how long it would take you to bring him up. I know. I have been bursting to know. How are things going with you two? I don't know. Our worlds are so different now. I have my life here, he has his on the road. Well, you never know where a road may take you. Well, I do know that after this, my road needs to take me to see the carollers to give them the song list. You wanna come? Yeah, sure. -Great. -Yes, this way. Let's go. [carollers singing off-key] ♪ The first Noel,♪ ♪ The angels did say ♪ Okay, I'll get some lozenges. Oh, Averie. Oh! Hi. Uh, what a surprise. What are you doing here? I was just hoping to check on the carollers. Oh, and who are these two fine people? Mom, Dad, this is Arnold. He oversees all the town events. Sorry, cold and flu season. Oh, okay. Very nice to meet you- I'm Patty. And Rob. Ah, well, lovely to meet you both. Um, I actually just wanted to go over the song list with the carollers. Right, the carollers. [coughing] Yes, well some of them are on a vocal rest. Yes. You don't want them to overdo it, to save that vocal energy for all that "pa rum pum pum pumming." Whatever you say. All right. Okay, anyway, here is the list of songs. You should see the inn. It looks better than you could imagine. Everyone is putting in 110 percent. Oh, well if that's the case, then you have time to come to my ugly sweater party tomorrow night. Oh yeah, that sounds like fun. It's a tradition I keep every year. So far, no one has been able to beat me at ugliest sweater of them all. We all have our talents. [laughing] So, you'll come? Absolutely. Oh, and invite Jesse too. Well. I should be getting back to rehea... To vocal resting. Carrots for noses, sticks for arms, silly hats, sunglasses, and feather boas, check. Check, and check. [laughing] Ooh. Hot chocolate bar, check. Hey Marshall. Stage looks great, do you need anything? No, I think we're about done. Perfect. Hey, Dan. Hey. What you up to? Just checking out the festival. It's all really coming together. It is, isn't it? Hey, have you seen Jesse? Yeah. Yeah, he just took Rowdy out for a walk a couple of minutes ago. Well, you two are both invited to Arnold's ugly sweater party later. Sounds like fun. Oh, and Averie, um. Look, I know things didn't end so great with Jesse all those years ago, but ever since we've been here, he's got a certain bounce in his step that I haven't seen in a long time. What about you, Dan? Me? Well you know, it's hard to find someone who wants to spend half their life on the road travelling. Someone with a... a sense of adventure. You are one of a kind. [laughs] You know what, I think I'm gonna check out the carriage ride. Oh great, have fun. Hello, there. Ms. Selig, isn't it? Hello. Care to join me? I was just going to take a ride. Oh no, no. I'm... I'm not very comfortable with heights. Well, life's all about stepping outside our comfort zones. Yes, and perhaps another time.

It is. Would you like to join me? Thank you. I want to apologize for the festival interfering with your time here. I know I've been torn between so many things. I may have one thing that will hold your attention. I was going to make myself a special treat. We can share. Thank you. Here you go. You don't get tired of travelling all the time? Especially during Christmas? No, I actually enjoy it. You see, I do it for William. My late husband. Oh, I'm so sorry. No, no. Don't be. Well, he was a wonderful man, and he always wanted to travel. But life got in the way. It has a way of doing that. So now, I travel during Christmas to honour him. Christmas at home was lovely though. It was his favourite holiday. He always decorated the house so beautifully, just... just like you've done here. More than anything though, he loved to roast chestnuts. The scent would just fill the house. Oh, it was wonderful. Hey. Don't mean to interrupt. Averie, do you think we could talk for a little bit? Yeah, I... I didn't realize the time. I think I'm going to call it a night and hand over the duties. Goodnight, Ms. Selig. Call me Phyllis. Are you okay? It's nothing. Sure doesn't seem like nothing. I overheard you talking to Dan. What did you hear? I heard you tell Dan the roads were clear so you could leave. Well, you didn't hear the rest of what I told Dan. I said "although we could leave, I didn't want to." Oh... Oh, I can't believe I... I don't want to spend Christmas on the road again. I want to spend it here, with you. If you'll have me. [phone rings] I'm sorry. Arnold! Averie! Let me guess, something terrible. Yeah, how did you know? Just a hunch. Look, half the carollers have come down with a cold. What? How? I had them on a strict regimen of Vitamin C and hot tea, but you know how these things spread at rehearsal, and... [sniffs] Well, a lot of the others, they've had to make changes to their holiday plans because of the storm. But they're performing tomorrow. I can't have a stage with no singers. Yes, I know. I... [sneezes] [sighs] Averie? Oh darn, um... What's the problem? I don't have any carollers for tomorrow. What am I supposed to do? Well, you need a singer. I happen to be one. You'd do that? Yeah. But on one condition. There's always a catch. Sing with me. [laughs] No. I don't do that anymore. Not even for the festival? Jesse, no. It's been so long. I don't know. Picture this. Averie and Jesse, reunion. Did you picture it? [laughs] What do you say? [sighs] I just don't know if I want to start things up again. With Jesse, or with the music? Both. Honey, we can't tell you what to do, but we can support you in whatever you decide. You know, I just think that chapter of my life is closed. I'm going to tell Jesse no. Meet me in five minutes in my cottage to decorate the tree? Sure. You got it. -We'd love to. -Okay. [knocking] Jesse? Jesse?
