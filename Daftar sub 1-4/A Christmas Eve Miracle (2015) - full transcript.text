[â™ª "We Wish You a Merry Christmas" plays] [narrator] Well, hello there. I'm glad you decided to visit our quiet little town, and to listen to my story about a typical American family, my family. It's a story about what happens when one of their wishes comes true during the Christmas break. Yep, that's me. This is Dustin, the man of the house. Ever need a good scratching behind the ear, he's your guy. He's also a very good accountant and a good man. Stay with me. Stay with me. Here, Ann, the oldest kid, is a workaholic, but, boy, she's thoughtful, well-balanced, great. Check the Internet. - [boy] James... - [dog] That's Stuart. He's adorable, bright, all-around life-loving good kid. Good parenting, see. I mean you are still a kid, right? If I were you, I'd just pull it together and not be so serious, but be kind of calm and your own self when you go up to her. There's one person we haven't met... The hardest working person I know... Sharron. Not... not her. We're about to meet her in a second. So what can I tell you about Sharron? Well, she's works at a successful advertising agency and she's a great mom. Although she questions herself... And, uh... right now she's starting to question her life. ...giving the campaign to Alec. It's not that I gave the campaign to him, it's not really that, - [dog] That's her. Cute, huh? - I'm considering giving it to Alec. Because you've got seven campaigns and he's got three. Yeah, but Ralph, I can handle it. I'm the most assertive person for the job. I'm the most imaginative. I work hard. - I'm... I'm dedicated, you know that. - We know that. We know that you're tremendous, you're great, you're dedicated. It's not a question of that. Is it a question of that? - Oh, no, no, no. - It's none of those things. But you're a wife. You're a mother. You're doing this and you've got seven campaigns and he's got three. Are you saying that because I have two kids and a husband, that that's a problem that's standing in the way? If something happens and you don't come through and you don't get it done in time, you know what that is? I lose them as a client. I can't have that. You have to understand. I do, however, I can balance it out and I can handle it. I promise. I'm nervous, that's not good. And I'm feeling nervous. - Am I feeling nervous? - A little bit nervous. And I don't wanna be nervous. You get that? Nervous is not good. So do what you were doing. You've got a big campaign you're working on. Togetherness campaign. Of course, I'm already started on it. It's going to be amazing, I can show you what I have so far. Stick with the other campaign and make sure you get that one done within the time period. We need it done. Work together, ladies. She's very good, also. - She's very good. - All right, good night, ladies. Come with me. But I'm not going to let you down, Ralph. There's no question of that. I need you to look into the Rocco's Bakery on the mezzanine level, because I need to use one of their ovens for Ann's bake sale in January, and I also need to know if I can get WiFi on Saturday at the hotel we're staying at. I need to know if they have a hot spot there. Could you check into that for me? - On Saturday? - Yeah. Isn't Ann's debate competition at the same time? That's right. - I'll make it work. - You always do. One way or another. You are the perfect mom, the perfect boss. Perfect executive? Just hope that Ralph thinks I'm the perfect executive when he stands back from the company and opens up the president position. Whoo... No, you, you have to put out a fire out first. You promised you'd present in the morning. The "Aloe" campaign. Oh, I can't do that. You've got to reschedule two weeks from today. I've got to go, traffic is going to be brutal. OK, people, we going into the home stretch here. - I need an adjective... and a noun. - Furry. - And a noun? - Blanket. Alright, are you ready for your Mad-Libs Christmas wish list? - Yeah. - On a "ridiculous" Christmas Eve, jolly and "electric" Saint Nick "swam" down a chimney and "interrupted" "100,000" "flimsy" presents for "icky" Ann, and "purple" Stuart. When they opened their "grumpy" gifts, they saw that Stuart got the latest "tiny" PlayStation, and Ann received a new, "naughty" iPhone, while their dad was presented with a "gross" and "furry" "blanket." Thanks kids. - I wanna do one. - Mom's home! Hi, guys, sorry I'm late. Relax, exhale. We will take care of everything. Hi, sweetie. No, No, No I want to help. OK. We can prep together and you can tell me about your day. You still haven't seen my talent show video. Oh, I haven't? Or my video essay for school... You're about a month behind sweet heart. You didn't tell me about that. You've been so busy, I didn't want to bother you. Well... why don't I watch while we prep. Yeah, let's do that. I'm so lucky your father's been filming all these special moments. - It's kinda like a DVR for real life. - Watch mine first. - I did a play for Dad today. - You did? What did you do today? - Honey, you're so adorable. - Look at that. - It's amazing. - Aww, Stuart. How did you get that outfit? Wait, wait, wait... watch that move, it's like the moon walk. - Oh, it's very Bob Fosse. - I bought it myself. - I love it. - Who did your makeup? - Yeah, honey... - I did? - You did? - By yourself? - Oh, honey, I'm so proud of you. - I helped. - I don't believe you. - A little bit. - Dad only helped a little bit. - Jack helped, too. - Stuart! - Oh! You've got to admit that's kind of impressive. He caught it in his mouth. That's pretty impressive. - Hey, hey, hey, no phone at the table. - Oh, come on. Yeah, no phones at the table. Thanks for the backup, sweetheart. Um... look am I the only one who's excited that we are going to Farthering Pines for Christmas? Why haven't we gone back till now? Well, honey, we've been really busy. We have not had time to fit it into our schedule. - Can I go inner-tubing? - Do bears eat ten-year-olds? - [Stuart] Yes... - None for me, thanks. No more snow in my pants. - [all laughing] - Oh, la-di-da. OK, I want us to pack tonight and I want us up at 7:00 and out the door at 8:00. - Dad, that's too early. - Sleep in the car. I just want us on the road. We need to get on the road... traffic. - [video game noises] - [door opens] Hey, you need help with homework? No, I already finished everything. You still having trouble focusing on your History class? Yeah, I am, Mom. You know what I use to do when I had trouble focusing on History when I was your age? I used to bring all the characters to life in my mind and I actually tried to make friends with them. - Really? - Yeah. I mean, it worked for me, maybe it'll work for you. I think I'll try that. I think so. Let's get ready for bed. Did you brush your teeth yet? - Let's make it happen, captain. - OK. [pop music plays] - [knocking] - Yeah? Hey, kiddo. How's your essay coming? Going fine, I'm taking a break. Hey, let me help you with that. OK. I am so proud of how much you are putting into your education, but I also don't want you missing out on the other things in life. I've noticed you are really cooped up in the house especially on the weekends. Any cute boys I should know about? I don't know... You don't know? [giggles] But Dad keeps telling me I can't date until college. What? He's such a prude. You know what I think? I think you just have to be yourself. And I think the right boy is going to come along. And maybe tomorrow I'll tell you a little story about how your dad swept me off my feet. Thanks, Mom. In college. [dog] So, Sharron's on edge. Everyone's trying to help. I wish I could. But I'm just a dog. Honey, that feels so good. You're shoulders feel like bricks. Does that have anything to do with the amount of pressure you put on yourself? I don't know. I just wish there was more time in every day where I could fit everything in. So, honey, the tax season is coming around the corner. You think things will pick up for you in the New Year? I wish... Yeah, sure. That's my time to shine, but with the amount of hours you've been putting in at work, I've had to be at home with the kids anyway, and even though I get frustrated with my career sometimes, I really... I really love the time with them. I would like to spend more time with them, too. Am I a lousy mom? The worst. I'm kidding. You're a wonderful mother, but sometimes it's hard to be super-mom and corporate warrior of the century, at the same time. I swear, sometimes I get exhausted just watching you. I'm doing this for us so we can have financial stability. And when will we finally have financial stability? I mean, I think we're doing pretty fine right now. What about our dreams? I think it's great that we're going to Farthering Pines, but what about traveling the world together? What about walking the Spanish steps and experiencing the pyramids of Egypt and seeing the Eiffel Tower? And drinking champagne until the sun comes up? What about that? Ann, what about the kids? I just want to know if we are going to get to do these things together while we're still young? Do you even have those dreams anymore? Yes, I do. But right now, what am I supposed to do, carry Stuart on my back across the Spanish steps? Or maybe you can drink champagne till dawn with Ann by the Eiffel Tower. [phone ringing] Get... Get my phone. Hello. Yeah, hey, Em. What... What? How is that even possible? I... OK, yeah, um... Thanks for the call. What's up? The "Togetherness" campaign, they've moved up the deadline to Christmas Eve. - Seriously? - Seriously. I mean, honey, I can't drop out of this campaign now. Because If I do Alec is gonna swoop in and he's gonna drag my name through mud. We are not going to do anything to interfere with your promotion. We'll just... push back the vacation to Spring Break or next Christmas... Or never. No. We're going. We're going to have our family time together, and I'm going to deliver the best campaign of my life. OK, killer. That's right, I am a killer. [dog] And so began the miraculous trip that would change Sharron and the Holden family's lives... forever. [Sharron] Would you like me to drive, honey? [Dustin] Thanks, but you'll run us off the road every time your phone rings. [Ann] OK, so Mom, this vacation can you be without your phone? - [Sharron laughs] - [Ann] For real, though. I don't wanna see your iPad out all the time. [Sharron] Uh-huh. I think we are finally here! Hey, tribe, come on in here. - Ho-ho, Merry Christmas! - Hi, We're the Holden clan. We're just checking-in. We've got more bags in the car. - Believe me, sorry. - The Holdens, well. Uh, and you must be Dustin. Ahh, I'm sorry, are you the new manager? We haven't been here for years. I'm the interim manager. I'm here to bring some Christmas cheer and fun and maybe grant a wish or two. - Well, that sounds good to us, right. - [Stuart] Right. - Um... and you would be? - Kris. My pleasure. Kris... as in Kris Kringle. Well, I don't mean to offend you, but you certainly look the part. Well, I do share the love of warm home baked chocolate-chip cookies with the man. Santa has a lot of names: St. Nick, Father Christmas, Santa Claus, Kris Kringle. You look like Santa to me. Well, I'll bet if anything else the local kids get a big kick out of your persona. [cell phone rings] And what do they call you, young man? I'm Stuart. - This is our dog, Jerry. - Hello, Jerry. [Jerry whimpers] And I'm Ann And that's my mom, Sharron, on the phone, per usual. [chuckles] Well, I'm very happy you're here. Hope you have a wonderful Christmas and get everything you ask for. You know what, I think that we have already. We are going to have a wonderful Christmas family vacation. - Well... - [Ann] Finally... - Family is the greatest gift. - Isn't it? I want a new bike, too. Unless you want a bike. Where's my manners? Holy night. These are my friends that volunteer from the foundation for families in need. - Hello. - Hi, Merry Christmas. This must be a very busy time of year for you. Yeah, it is. But it's gonna be an amazing year for families in need. We got all these donations from this company, Toys and Fun. They are going to give us toys for all these kids in need. [Dustin] That's wonderful. Before we leave, we want to make a donation. - Wow, thank you, very generous. - Merry Christmas. Our pleasure. - Merry Christmas, guys. - Merry Christmas. Here you go. Now listen be sure to come back to the lobby before you leave. The resort likes to leave a little something for everyone under the tree. Well, isn't that wonderful. You can count on us being here right on Christmas Eve. We will be there with bells on. OK, come on kids, let's go. Mr. Kringle... For the record, I think you're Santa. Don't forget: red bicycle. Got it. - Do you want to take top bunk? Cool. - Yeah, I love the top. - This place is pretty awesome, right? - Yeah. - [chuckles] - We're gonna have so much fun! Yeah, we are. Hey, honey, check it out. Not bad. - Honey, I like this room. - Beautiful, right? - Look at that view. - I know. Breathtaking, I love it. Snow. - OK. Yeah. - Hey, honey. This is just one of your Christmas presents but since I made it myself... - Did you wrap it yourself? - Guilty. - Looks like it. - [chuckles] Oh, I thought I'd give it to you early. Thank you. Hope you like it. [gasps] - I absolutely love it. - It took awhile. It wasn't easy to find pics of you without your phone, iPad, and computer attached, but I managed. Thank you. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. [Jack] The Farthering Pines Olympics, begins! [Holly] Whoo-hoo! [Jack] Yes, of course I'm kind of excited about sharing a place with the Jones'. [Holly] I know you're excited, Jack. So, basically, this program is all about presentation, right. It's kind of like what Mommy does when she's at work and I'm doing my commercial campaigns. The really cool thing, you can use it with your friends: for football, or you can play with army men, or action figures, stuff like that. And when you get to my age, you use it for business. [hums "Deck the Halls"] OK, guys, how many marshmallows do you guys want in your hot cocoa? None, for me. Thanks. Fill my cup up with marshmallows, then put the cocoa in. Because it's the holidays, you get a pass. - I want the same honey. - Alright. Thank you. Hi. Well, what if I wanna be a rock star? Especially if you want to be a rock star. - You make learning fun. - I do? Thank you. - [phone ringing] - I make learning fun. You think so, huh? - Hey, Em, what's up? - [Em] Got the file. - Uh-huh. OK, I'm going right to it. - Check your email. Hold on a sec. [Eva] I'm looking forward to sharing a place with the Carters. [Robert] That's right. Get to spend some good quality time together. [Robert] OK, we're here, Jones family. Whoo-hoo! Hey, you ready? Let's grab a trail guide in the lobby and take a hike. Yeah, just need my coat, my WiFi hotspot and my work station. Alright, you ready? You sure, maybe you need the launch codes for NORAD? - Grab those cause we might need them. - OK, great. Open the door, Stuart. Jerry, let's go. Let's go. Mush. Whoo! Yeah! All right, that's one for your family. How hard... hard is it for you to count to three? I'm surprised I knew how to count that high. That's a big number for you, Jones. [Ann] Hey, wait up. [talking indistinct] - Hi, I'm Stuart. - Hey, we've got people. - [Jack] Huh? - Oh, hello. Hi. I see you've met the ambassador of the Holden clan. Wouldn't it be nice if grown-ups could make friends that easily. Well, actually, Jack and I became friends the same way. - Really? - Cool. Well, it's about as fast as we became friends. Really? Well, after many, many years of hating each other. - Now that I remember. - You remember that part. I remember that part. Anyway, I'm Jack. This is my beautiful wife, Holly, and my lovely daughter, Sienna. And I'm his best friend in the whole wide world, Robert. This is my gorgeous wife, Eva, and our very handsome son, Tommy. Hello. - I'm Dustin, you've met Stuart, - I'm Sharron, and this is Ann. Hi. Hey, as long as you're here, Holden family, you care to participate in a friendly game of Farthering Pines Winter Olympics? - What's that? - It's a game my grandpa made up. Yeah, my dad used to bring us down here when I was a kid and we've been playing ever since. And losing ever since, 'cause we've been... - [cheering] - Ouch, that hurts. Robert and Jack ran into each other here last year, after of not seeing each other in years and renewed their friendship. And our families hit it off instantly. In fact, Holly and I now own a bakery together. - Our kids are even dating. - Oh, stop. - Oh, are we? - Yeah, they are. And they lived happily ever after. Can we go sledding, please? Come on, Stew. [all cheering] Stuart, are you...? - Alright! - Just hold on... - That was awesome, Stuart! - Look at him go. He's so great. How's the bakery business going? You know, it's... - It was Incredible at first... - It just keeps getting better everyday. What? OK, it's hit a little bit of a downturn. - Huh... - Slight. You know, we're still getting good reviews, we just... really haven't had the foot traffic. You know, we just need that spark to bring it back like it was when we first opened. It was incredible. - We just need that one thing. - What about a new hip recipe? - [Eva] Like a signature one? - Yeah. - That's a great idea. - Hey, that's a great idea, sweetie. [all cheering] Ooh... Can I do one more run, Dad? No. Sorry, bud. We've got to get out of here. Help an old man out, would ya? Go with your mom over there. Sienna, can we talk? Sienna, how many times do I have to say I'm sorry. You never even try to come see me. How can I? We live so far apart. There's planes that leave every day. Hey, Mom and Dad, wait up. Do I sense trouble in paradise with the heart-breaker up there. We live so far apart and she doesn't think I make enough of an effort. - Well, do you really like her? - I really do. - Want to know the secret? - Sure. Make the effort. - Oh... - You guys, that was so much fun. - Thank you for including us. - Thank you. - I hope it wasn't too much for you. - No. Why don't you guys come over to our house for dinner. We'll cook. - We'll play more games. - Wait, Who's going to cook? You're going to cook. [all speaking indistinct] How can we say no to the lovely bakers? - I love chocolate. - You trying to say no. - You can't say no to them. - You can't say no. - The Holden family. - [cheering] And welcome to Farthering Pines fantastic game of charades. Up top, up top! Come on, big Jack. Start it out for us. OK, let's go. - ...titles, books, movies... - [Dustin] Songs. And songs... says the new guy. - Your rules. - OK. - It's a movie. - Movie. [Holly] Four words. What is he doing? He's, like, giving baseball signals. [talking over each other] Twelve Years a Slave. Yes, and that's how it's done, Holden family. [cheering] Don't hit me, baby, ever again. Alright, new guy. OK, OK, I'm the newbie here. Let me focus. Let's rein it in. Alright, I'm going to go with another... - [Sharron] Movie. - OK. Um, um...

[Tommy] Weekend - [Sharron] Weekend at Bernie's. - [cheering] I never saw that film. - All right. - [Eva] Oh, honey, yes. Hold on, hold on, let me begin by saying that they like to cheat. No, we are telepathic. It's kind of crazy, it's kind of nuts. - [Eva] We do not cheat. - Try not to get this. - OK. - [Jack] Sexy... [Eva] Two words... [all speaking indistinct] - Ooh, it's all sorts of stuff. - [Dustin] Mushroom cloud. - It's Apocalypse Now! - Yeah! You are so talented. I think we have worn out our welcome a little bit, maybe. - [all] No! - Maybe a little bit. Vacations involve a certain amount of rest. So I think we are going to say good night now. [Eva] I get it, I get it. [all talking indistinct] We come, we conquer, we leave. Or something like that. All right. Go! I just want to say something. You ever meet people that you feel are going to be friends for the rest of your life? - No. - Me neither. [all talking indistinct] [Dustin] You know, that's why I'm leaving. OK, wait, before you go. First of all, welcome to Farthering Pines. It's a... miraculous place. I've been coming here since I was a child. Um... I've never left here without learning something very special and becoming a better person for it. So, Stuart welcome. But, does that mean that Jerry will go home as a person? - [whimpers] - Jerry's not a person. He's our dog. It's very possible that he could come home a person. Good night, Holdens. [all talking indistinct] - Tomorrow, love, OK? - Next time, I'll play... [Robert] Omelette bar, our place 8:00. Sounds great. What a pleasure. You're a doll. - Come back. - Thank you. So long, guys. - Bye, guys. - Nice to meet you all. Braid it. Like this. - Like Heidi. - [chuckles] And you'd sing together and go... â™ª Ricola â™ª Ricola [muffled] Look at that. One, two, three. - I almost got it in my mouth. - You did! It was right here. - Yeah, we're doing good... - I'm so proud of you. I love that you are teaching me this. This is so much fun. - Be safe on the mountain. - [Dustin] Get ready to go, Ann. - Love you. - Love you. - We will. Love you. - Love you. - Come on, Ann, the slopes await. - Alright. We are going to have so much more fun then they are, right? We are going to build the biggest snowman known to man. OK. I'm so excited, but first I have to set my alarm, because I have a conference call at 11:15 with my boss and clients. I just didn't want to forget that. Ooh, look at you. You're going to be so warm and snug. - You ready? - I'm ready, Mom. We're gonna build the biggest snow man in the world. Yeah, it's gonna be the biggest! OK, what are we gonna do first? This is awesome, Mom! Let's go find some... I feel like this part is uneven. Let's give him a little... yarmulke. - Yeah, I love that! - Look, Mom, he's waving. That's awesome! [both laughing] Here we go, snow angels. Whoo! I can't do my legs and hands at the same time. [barking] It must be about 11:00 already. Or at least close to it. Hey... Where's my phone? Hey, honey, did you see Mommy drop her phone out of her pocket? - No. - OK. It's gotta be here. Let me just retrace my steps. [groans] If I lost my phone my life is going to be over. OK... Oh... Come on, honey, we gotta go. Why? We gotta get back to the cabin because I'm late. [screams] [groans] You OK? [groans] My ankle. Sweetie, does it hurt. I'm so sorry baby. You think you could be really brave and power through the pain? - I know it hurts. - I'll try. We'll get back to the cabin, and you can have as many marshmallows as you want, OK? - OK. - Get on my back. [barking] On a scale of one to ten, how's the pain tolerance? - [whimpers] - You're such a brave boy. Eight... We're almost there. [groans] OK, we're home. Honey, could you take Stuart, please? Hey, what happened to you, pal? I lost my phone, I need my phone. He sprained his ankle on the way back. - Mom, I found your phone. - Oh, God. Thank, God. I have such an important call that I think I've missed. - Can you please just put some... ice? - Yeah, yeah, of course. Come on, champ, let's get some ice on it. [all talking over each other] [speaks indistinct] Da... I missed it! [clears throat] - [typing] - Hi, Ralph. Sharon, I'm not happy. Where were you? Um... I lost my phone, uh, and I lost track of time. I, uh, I was with my son. We were all waiting for you for the phone call. Everybody showed up. Take a look. Everybody came in. Who didn't show up? There's one person who didn't show up. Who was that? - [man] I believe that was her. - That was Sharon. I know. I'm so sorry, Ralph. I can call them, and I can explain what happened. You want to work with us. We're a team. We need you there with us. My son had an accident, Ralph. I'm sorry to hear about the accident. I hope there's nothing serious, but with that said, I have to run a business. If you can't do it, if you can't show up, tell me. Alec can do it. Peter can do it. Murray can do it. - We have people who can do it. - I understand. -I've gotta go. - OK. - Let's speak tomorrow, Sharron. - Thank you. - Feeling any better, pal? - Yeah. - How you doing? - Good. I made you some hot cocoa with lots of marshmallows. I'm so sorry, baby. - I'm a horrible mother. - Oh, come on. No, I am. [sighs] I don't know who I think I'm fooling. Trying to act like I have it so together. I'm probably going to lose my campaign and my promotion - and... I might even lose my job. - Sweetie, no you're not. You are too invaluable to them and please don't beat yourself up over this. You just had a bad day. He got hurt, because I put my job before him. I'm so sorry, baby. - It's OK, Mom. - No, it's not OK. - It's not OK. I gotta get some air. - Hey... honey. Don't follow me, Dustin. I need to be alone. It's OK. She's just a little upset right now. Don't worry. All right? - OK. - OK? All right. I can't believe I hurt my baby boy. My child. God, what has happened to me? It's too much, it's too much all the time. Not enough hours in the day. I can't be super-mom and have the kind of career that I want. I'm exhausted... all the time. I'm stretched so thin. My kids need more from me then I can give to them. And you know what, honestly... [sobs] ...they deserve better. Maybe they would be better off without me. Maybe... we should have waited to have children. Until we had made something of ourselves. Maybe Dustin, he wouldn't have lost his ambitions. And we could have traveled the world together. Show me the way. [Jerry] Sharon was about to get her wish come true. [plays tune] Honey... [groans] - You OK? - [mumbles] Go back to sleep. [groans] [owl hoots] [whistles] Good morning, honey. You look nice. Thanks, hon. Why are you up so early? [chuckles] Are you kidding me, babe? The bell rang on Wall Street an hour ago. I need to see if Stuart Holdings is looking as good as I am. Stuart Holdings? How is Stuart? Is he OK? - What happened last night? - Last night? Uh, he went for a run, took a shower, we went to town. Did that whole horse drawn sleigh thing up to that chateau with the peak. Cracked a couple of bottles of Dom. Hit a club and danced till we shut that bad boy down. - Wait a minute... - You were tipsy, but I didn't think you drank enough to not remember. We went out last night? After what happened. - What about the kids? - The kids are...? Are you OK? I don't know. I'm just wondering what's going on. I tell you what. How about I order some coffee, maybe a couple of mimosas, and a big old breakfast. Maybe a little something in your tummy will jog your memory, gorgeous. I think I'm dreaming. That's what it is, I'm dreaming. Hmm... Hello? Uh... Guys? You guys? Where are you? Huh... Hey, guys... Um, Dustin... Stuart, Ann? Stuart? Stuart? Ann? [grunts] Dustin... [barking] OK... [barking] [Stuart] Yeah, let's do that again. Hey! Give it back. Get your own sled, grow up. - You're so stupid! - You're a spoiled brat. Hey, give it back. No, grow up, get your own sled. You're so mean. - [Ann] Get your own sled. - [Stuart] I want that one. [mumbling] Jack, Jack. I love ya buddy, but you're gonna have to control your son over here. Or we're going to be cutting our whole trip short. This is not my idea of a fun vacation. Oh, pick on the little guy why don't ya. Play the violin. Come on. Your kid doesn't have the common decency to give me the time of day. My daughter has given you nothing but the time of day, sir. And I'm sorry, how can I expect to stay in business with somebody who can't even run her own family? Eva, how can you say that when your own daughter won't even let a child play on a sled for five minutes. - He's been on it all morning. - No, I haven't. What's going on over here? You guys were getting along so well last night? - Huh? - [Eva] Who is that? It's Robert right? OK... Stuart, Ann, come back to the cabin. Your dad's making breakfast. Whoa, whoa, hey, hey! Stewie, stay away from her, OK. Come on inside, I'll make you some hot cocoa. Stuart! Ann! Say goodbye to senorita looney toons, and slowly back away. - What's going on? - She may have a gun. - Come on. - Stuart! Ann! Don't make me come all the way over there and get you, I'm starving. - [grunts] - Excuse me, can I help you? Yes, you can help me get my kids. Lady your trespassing right now. Excuse me? No, excuse me, excuse me. If you don't get off this property I will call security. What kind of shenanigans is going on around here? You were really nice last night. Now you are being extremely disrespectful. [Jack] Last night? I've never seen you before. I am coming from that cabin right over there and now I'm coming to your house. Holly, get the boy come on. Holly, Holly, she's crazy. How many times do we have to go around this whole game of you picking up your iPad right when you get home? Look at me! You have to learn how to interact with the family, OK? And sometimes you actually have to do chores. Which is exactly what I'm going to make you do right now. - [knocking] - I got it. - Yes? Oh, no. - Hi, what's going on here? I don't know. What's going on with you? - I'm just here to get my kids. - It's your turn to do dishes, Ann. Uh-uh, whatever, you do it, golden boy. Can I just ask you a personal question? No, I don't-- Are you renting the place over there or just squatting? Squatting? Because I actually know the owners and I can have you arrested. - Let me see my kids. - That's an excellent idea. iPad after you do dishes. No, give it back, quit ruining my life. [both] Ann. I don't know what you are trying to prove here with this kind of behavior. Not her again. Hey, you can't have any cookies till I say you can. Honey, is there something we can do to let our friend get back to the land of... - I think you need a little... - Would you like to go get a burrito? I hope... playing lots of tricks on you. - I mean, seriously. - Go buy a burrito. I said I wanted a Station Four, not this. Stuart? What are you doing? That was your Christmas present! You go to your room. No Christmas presents for you, mister! - Place that thing... - Bye, bye. Don't come back now, you hear. And you wonder why you make friends so easily. [mumbling to self] ...ignore me, just ignore Mom. Oh, yeah. Sure. That's nice to do. Acting like I'm some kind of stranger, or something. Like they didn't know me. Well, I'm not crazy. [chuckles] I don't think you're crazy, but you are a little off your rocker to be wearing that outfit. Would you like me to run and get you a coat? No, thank you. That's very kind of you. Listen you've seen Dustin and I, right? In the lobby with our children the other day. You and Dustin? Yes, we have children, those are our kids. No, I believe what you said was that perhaps this time in life wasn't a good time to have children. That you wanted to have time together, that you wanted to see the great wonders of the world. Sounded to me like you didn't have time for children. But we have kids. Our kids. Those are my kids right there in that cabin. Well, maybe this would be a good opportunity to see how life would be without children. Since they are not your children now. What do you mean they are not my children now? I'll tell you what. If they were your children-- But they are my children. If they were they'd be better behaved then they are now. Well, they usually are much better behaved. Thank you. Why don't we get you back inside and get you by the fire. I... Oh, I get it. You're in on these shenanigans as well, aren't you? Listen, I don't know what you put in the hot cocoa around here, but I'm getting my kids back. Merry Christmas. I hope you get your wish. Yeah, whatever. Whoo... They wanna play games, well, I can play games, too. [speaks indistinct] OK, Sharron, apparently you don't have any children. It's just you and Dustin and work. Is that an Ider Optical leather handbag? You're welcome. Honey, I don't know what's going on, but we can't afford this. OK, bye. Can't afford? [chuckles] We don't use the a-word around here, sweetheart. - Oh, we don't? - No, no. Stuart Holdings has been on a peak for the last six quarters. Oh, look at that. And our brewery's elegant Ann Ale, is a huge hit in the Southwest. Wait a minute, backup, you named a beer after Ann? I always just liked that name and since we launched our digital division... - Yeah? - Uh... Holden Publishing is doing gangbusters and we can work on the way, - so, yes we're going. - Where? - Skiing. - Oh. Yeah, I guess. Great, and, uh... I booked us a trip to Paris in April. - I know we have been there before... - Have we? ...but never in the Spring time. I wouldn't want to miss out on the Spring time. - [Sharron] Wow. - [Dustin] All right. A helicopter is the only way to get here. [Sharron laughing] [Dustin] Because we can do whatever we want to do. [both whooping] - [Sharron] Oh, oh, the tree! - [Dustin] Are you back there, Sharron? I'm back here... - [Dustin] Will you look at that? - [Sharron] So beautiful. - OK, come on, Sharron! - [laughing] I'm coming, honey! Honey, this is so romantic. The look on your face when that chairlift stopped was priceless. I know, she was so serious. Oh, God. - Oh, my God. - No, no, no. Come on, come on. - No, honey I need to unwind. - Didn't you unwind on the way home? Yeah, but my idea of unwinding is not listening to you booking airline tickets from here to Timbuktu. Come on, we can rest when we are six feet under. Honey, I feel like I'm six feet under. Well, just a few more steps because I've got a surprise for you, lady. Oh, really, more surprises? - Yes, yes, this way no peeking. - I like surprises. OK. - Don't peek, don't peek. - OK, just give me a hint. - Give me a hint. - Over here. Whoa, whoa... - OK. - Now look. Look. It's a... Honey, it's a... vintage dress. - That's like a $10,000 dress. - Eleven, but who's counting. Why don't you put it on so I can tear it off? - Can we afford it? - [chuckles] Don't worry about that. You know, it's going to look amazing on you. While we are gorging ourselves on sushi in a skyscraper overlooking Tokyo this summer. - I've always wanted one. - Just... Well, you've got one now. It's beautiful. - You like it? - I love it. - I love you. - I love you, too. That was so great when you tackled Tommy off his snowmobile. - [laughing] - That was pretty awesome. - That was so awesome, give me five. - No, it was me! And it was dangerous. I don't know what's gotten into you lately. Well, he only took the blue one because I wanted it. Stuart! [chuckles] - Hello, Carter family, - Hey, Kris. [chuckles] So you know, Stuart, some of the most respected leaders in history have taken a kind gentle approach. You know, when you can find that gentleman inside you, then you, my friend, will be bound for greatness. - I like you. - I do, too. So, did I sense a little tension up there? Yes, I don't know what happened. Our families were getting along so great, now all of a sudden it's like our kids have issues with each other. It's like we are the Hatfields and McCoys. Tis the season to mend relationships and for wishes to come true. - You said it Kris. - I hope so. Oh... You know, you might not believe this, but I can still remember young love. Everything is great when me and Tommy are together, but... Yeah, the key is to make the most of the time that you do have together and not to worry about what's to come. You know, I've got a special project I could really use some help on. Could you get Tommy and the rest of the kids together and give me a hand? Would you be willing to help out? Sure. Yeah, I know, but I don't think he has the right look. What? He looks like he has a permanent scowl on his face. He looks like he's mad at the world. Hey, babe, if we don't blow out of here in the next five minutes, we're gonna lose our reservation. Yeah, I understand, but we are selling a stereo system that is supposed to be connecting friends and family, it's called the Togetherness Campaign. Right, and I can't afford any more mishaps with clients so... - [barking] - [talking indistinct outside] [exhales] Uh, yeah, I'm still here. - [knocking] - I'll get it. It's probably our dinner. But it could be our deranged neighbor, waitress wacko. I call her waitress wacko because she serves up the insanity. - Ha-ha, funny. - My kids hate me. - Oh. - I come bearing gifts. Well, hello. The delivery boy was in a hurry and I thought he was frazzled, so I volunteered to bring the food to some of my favorite people. Oh, thank you. Listen, I've ordered more then enough food, so please stay and eat with us. I appreciate the offer, but I just about polished off a whole holiday ham by myself. - Milky... with white truffle. - Oh, um. These are black truffles! Ahh, honey, I told them you wanted the white ones. I can't eat that. I... I will just call them and tell them to bring the ones you do want. No, forget about it. You don't care. - Ohh... kids. - Oh, my God. - Ann... Ann can you hear me. - Ann, take off those headphones. What? Kris is trying to get your attention, and please you need to be grateful for the food your father got you. Why? 'Cause it's Christmas time and it would be really nice... - Oh, really. - Oh, really. I'm doing a really special project and I could use another hand. Tommy, all the other kids have generously offered to help. Would you mind giving me a hand? As long as I don't have to do anything, and anything get away from matchy, matchy, Mom and Dad over here. - [Kris] Oh, well... - Wow. Thank you. Thank you very much. I need a little help. I appreciate it. Well, listen, you folks have a great dinner. Thank you very much. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas to you. You and I need to talk. - Everything alright, Mr. Jones? - I'm sorry, it's... It's Ann. I'm having a hard time with her. Sometimes she doesn't even feel like she's my own kid. I understand completely, but you just hang in there and show a lot of patience. Things are going to be OK. Hey, babe. Here's a thought. How about we head into town tonight for some lobster. I don't know honey, I think I've gained a few pounds since yesterday. Yeah, I think you have. [chuckles] Just kidding. Um, I know, why don't we go into town to that really cute little place and just get something simple. Yeah, by cute you mean cheap? I don't even think they have table service there, and you can forget about getting a decent bottle of wine and no way on a good champagne. OK, well, let's go with the lobster then. You planning another trip? Yeah, I'm thinking we just hit Egypt on the way back from Japan. Genius? Honey, we are going to run out of places to go before the year is up. Oh, no, no, no. Did you know that there are 28 nation states and over 7,200 islands in the Caribbean alone? I'm not going to 7,200 islands. - Here watch this. - Hm? - [giggles] Isn't that great? - Great. I think you need some more champagne sweetie. No, I just want a warm cup of cocoa with some marshmallows in it. What's it like in the North Pole? What's it like in the North Pole? Well, I'm not sure. I really have no idea. But I've heard it's pretty cold in the North Pole. What is Christmas, really? [Kris] That is a good question. Christmas... is a celebration of love, forgiveness... Time to embrace your family. Time to acknowledge the love and sharing that you have with one another. Time to really look at your family and say this is what's precious. Yeah, and how do you miss that, huh? And why would you send anything to print without my prior approval? Especially this little thing we like to call a cover, because the main character has the king of all swear words tattooed on his face. It's supposed to be a book for eight-year-olds. God, this silence is eerie. Hey, Ben, let me... let me call you back. Silence, are you being sarcastic with me? I miss being around kids. [laughing] That's good. I mean... That's good. I mean, when you were around kids? Like on a commercial shoot? You know what? You know what you can do if you want to be surrounded by a bunch of kids, you could just come up with a campaign for some kinda kids product. Look, we have money. We are in a good place. I just think it's time we start talking about a family. - A family? - Yeah. Uh... you're serious? I... I thought we kind of dismissed that a long time ago. I mean are you sure you want kids? What about your career? - My career? - You know what, you know what? Maybe we can do this. Um... nannies, we'll get an army of them. So they can do the heavy lifting and we can still do what we want to do. Except, no kids on vacations, even with the nannies, 'cause they're still going to be at you and wanting all your time. Never... mind. [Kris humming] Honey, I got you something. This is something you are going to be into, sweetie. - Another gift. - Another gift, but I just saw them, and they just seemed incomplete without your gorgeous face. - Oh, my God. - [chuckles] - Wh... Who's the designer? - Just me and my elves. - You and your elves. - Been busy at the workshop. - Wow. - Now who is that movie star? I don't know. Who is it? - I love them. - I love you. [barking outside] [Stuart] Come on, Jerry. Let's go! Come on. Hurry up, Jerry. Jerry, run, it's the crazy lady! She's going to eat us! Go, hurry, run! You know, Stuart, there's a lot of people struggling in the world. And you've been pretty blessed. I hope you see that. I know I got it good. So why do you complain so much about things that some people can only wish for? Because he thinks none of the girls will like him if everything he owns isn't name brand. Shut up. Well, you know, you should be confident in who you are, not what you have. You're a pretty bright and charming kid. You don't need to brag. And, Ann, you've got such a generous spirit. You're so withdrawn and combative with your family. Well, why should I make the effort if my parents don't? You won't. You know, if the whole world felt like that it'd be a pretty dark and cold place. You've got to open yourself up a little bit more, take a few more chances. Bring out that warmth you want so much in yourself. You know I'm pretty proud of you kids. I mean, you really have the true Christmas spirit. - So... who wants some more cocoa? - Me, I do. I'll take a cup. Thank you. Put a lot of marshmallows in my cocoa. [chuckling] [Stuart speaks indistinct] Children are God's blessing to us all. I think you and Dustin would have been such good parents. I bet Stuart wouldn't be nearly so spoiled if you'd been his parent, and you could have helped Ann through her teenage years. Family unit: makes us all better people. Better get this cocoa to the kids. OK, kids, hot chocolate time. [Jerry] I like humans, but dogs are fun, too. I mean, you know, I'm a dog. It was good to see Tommy and Sienna getting along. They're nice kids. Watch out! They were having fun. Everyone was doing what they liked. And Sharron was enjoying her successful husband and great career. Well, I finished. I'm finally done with the Togetherness Campaign. I finished early. The clients are happy. They've approved, they think "it's brilliant," was their exact words. And... [Jerry] Everything seemed to be going along well. But was it really enough? Now all I have to do is... film the commercial when I get back. I think it's psychological. - I mean, honestly... - [knocking] ...do you know what my problem is? [laughing] Oh, I do. I do know what your problem is. - He... You're part of my problem. - Oh, really. That's just it. I don't have a second to myself. - Oh, no. - Mr. Jones. Sharon Holden, hi. I wanted to apologize for my behavior the last couple of days. Dustin and I have been having a couple of problems, but... - We have? - Yeah, but we're OK now. Um... we all have our off days. We... we do. We all have our off days. I mean, you should see my wife when she has her off days. - She goes bonkers. - I can only imagine. So I thought it would be a good idea if I came in and apologized to everybody, you know, before we all leave the resort. - You're OK? - I'm fine. OK, then come on in. Merry Christmas, make yourselves at home. Thanks for being so understanding. - Hey, everybody. Look who's here. - Hey, that's fantastic. You know I wish I could stick around, but I just can't. Work is crazy. Oh, no, it's OK. I gave her tranquilizers. No, that's OK, I deserve that. Let me get you some wine. [chuckles] [chuckles] Don't mind my husband. He is not himself right now. No, that's OK. I deserve that. Um, I wanted to apologize for my behavior the last couple of days, in the red polka dotted pajamas... - Why don't you just come sit down. - That would be lovely. Hey, guys. I want you to meet our neighbor. This is Sharron. I know you thought she was nuts. But she's OK. I'm Dustin her better half. There's room for one more players. You want to join? - Yeah, come sit. - Tommy says you eat ten-year-olds. - Oh, really. That's not true. - Why are you always staring? Oh, I wanted to apologize for that, but I was kind of embarrassed. And I... - Can I sit by you, is that OK? - I don't mind. OK, thank you. [talking in background] You know, you have a really handsome smile. Thanks. I'm going to guess what you want for Christmas. What? - A red bike. - How did you know? [chuckles] I can't give away my secrets. What does Tommy want? Hmm... I think he wants a sports car. I like that. What do you say, Dad? I don't know, it's cheaper then the plane you wanted, right? - [all chuckle] - [Ann] Hey, I want a car, too. Then you get a car, and you get a car, and... - Do I get a car? - [Tommy] We get all cars! [Robert] You get a car! [all talking over each other] Deal. You know, we're playing for real money. - I'm kidding. - [Stuart] Oh, I'm making a profit. Uh, do you want something to eat. - Yeah. - Alright. I'll get you a car and some food. - So... Jack is it? - Yeah. So what's your thing? What are you into? What do you do? I'm a dabbler. I'm a bit of an entrepreneur. I mean, Robert's got me setup now. Really, a son of a baker. We just sort of parlayed that into a pretty good little national franchise. Franchise, sweet. I'm an entrepreneur myself. I have a little hedge fund. Stuart Holdings, maybe you've heard of it. Yeah, oh, that's you? We made a killing recently, short selling the drachma. Pretty much single-handedly destroyed the Greek economy. So that's a feather in our cap. - Got to be proud of that. - Yeah, thank you. Decimated a country. Pretty much crushing it across the board. - You're in advertising? - I am, yes. What was the campaign that you were talking about? - The one that's... - The togetherness campaign. Yes, it's a stereo system that connects you to the WiFi, to basically anyone in the world. Yeah, dance to the same songs at the same time. Exactly, you're connected to your loved ones through their music. I like that. Ann, have you thought about what you want to do with your future? Yeah, being creative for a living sounds good. I think I want to do what you do. What about you Stuart? Eh... schools OK, I guess, but I wish it was more fun learning. [Sienna] Hey, I'm out of cash, I need more ones. You guys have any coffee? Do you actually enjoy the whole kid thing? Oh, it's the greatest and the worst thing in my life. I'm constantly worried and... you know, money for college. - It just doesn't get any easier. - Yeah. But it's the greatest thing in my life. Have you considered having kids? Well, we talked about it for about five minutes then we laughed it off. - I would now like to do an impression. - [laughing] - Guess who I am. - Another one. Ann! Stuart! [yelling] Stop. I'm sorry, I'm really sorry. Well, you guys. Thank you so much for including us. We've had the best time. I've never laughed so much in my life. My face is still hurting from laughing. It's ridiculous. I'm gonna get some more of this. Well, we're really glad you came over. I'm so happy to just spend the time. I'm really glad you came over because I would have been devastated to think you really were mental. Oh, yeah, well I do have my moments. I must say. Surprisingly you are very lovely. Well, you guys are really lovely, too. You're both bakers and you have beautiful children. Oh, well thank you. Oh, about the bakery, we really should be franchising at this point, but we got into this little tiff. All my fault, I mean I do get really jealous about her recipes. No, Eva, I'm sorry, and you shouldn't be so hard on your food. Best scones I've ever had. They're nothing like hers and you know what. If I could just get my hands on my great-grandmother from Ireland, she had this famous mystery pie. Oh, my, no one knew what the heck was in there. But they came from all over. I mean neighbors, neighbors, they practically came from Ireland. I'm telling you, she gave the recipe to one person on her deathbed, me, and I lost it. Is that animal skin taken? Uh, I think it's available. Thank you. We should have learned. We never should have... I mean, from last time we drifted apart, right?. - I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - Sorry... Cheers, buddy. At this point can we... shake hands. - Yeah! - [laughing] Garrett just asked me to Winter Formal. Oh, my God! Mom, will you take me dress shopping next week? [both] I'd love too. I think she's having another off day. [exhales] I have to go. Thanks, I'm just... I'm sorry. Bye. Kris Kringle? Can you reverse this? Something wrong, Mrs. Holden? Can you reverse what's happened? I want my family back. Sometimes we don't realize what we have is precious till we have lost it. - Hi. - Hi. - You OK? - No, I'm sad. Why? Because I miss you. - Me? - Yeah. I'm your mother, Stuart. - Not the woman in there. - No you're not. My mom, is my mom. - I know, but I'm your real mom. - Stop it. You're not! You like to play pantomime. And you love to join in soccer tournaments and you always win. And you love to brush your teeth really hard so that there lots of foam coming out of your mouth. Go away. Leave me alone. Oh, touchdown! [barks] [sobbing] Please... What do I have to do to get my family back? I know now that... I know now that we had... ...Ann and Stuart at the perfect time. I don't care. I don't care about vacations. I don't care about my success. My world is empty without my children. Without my beautiful children... ...and the sweet caring loving devoted father that Dustin was. If I get them back... If I get them back... I will cherish them. I will cherish every moment with them, and I won't let anything stand in the way. Not work, not anything. Please, please show me the way. - [Dustin] Sharron! - [Ann] Mom! There she is! Hey, kids! Hey, everybody! - [Ann and Stuart] Mom! - [Dustin] I found her! We missed you, so much! - I love you so, much. - [Stuart] I love you. You're the best mom a kid could have. [Ann] I love you, Mom. - I love you, Mom. - I love you, too. [Ann] Never leave us again. We missed you, we thought we lost you forever. [Dustin] Don't ever do that again. You know, searching through snow during Christmas - is kind of our thing. - Something about this place. It just brings people together, and you all are coming to our place for a great big Christmas dinner. Come on. Come on. - Let's go. - Where were you? - Come on, Holden family. - Seriously. You got some 'splainin' to do. [speaking indistinct] [humming] [Jerry] So the families came together for a great, big Christmas dinner. One more toast everybody. Merry Christmas. [Ann] Merry Christmas. - To Stewie. - To Stewie. - Or to wonderful friends. - And, Jack, to you, buddy. [all giving cheers] [all talking over each other] [Jerry] Sharron was about to get her wish come true. [phone ringing] - Excuse me, I have to take a call. - [Dustin] Sure. I'll be right back. - Hi, Ralph, how are you? - It's Ralph. I'm fine. Merry Christmas. I may need to take a couple of weeks off. [Ralph] I completely understand it. We don't wanna lose you. Well, thank you for being so understanding. Well, you're an important part of the organization. Merry Christmas to you and yours, Ralph. Merry Christmas, we're looking forward to seeing you. - Goodbye. - Bye-bye. [all cheering] Well done! Merry Christmas! [Jerry] Sharron started re-balancing her life... ...and Jack, Robert and Dustin were about to go into a new business together. I... I wrote this book when I was 12-years-old. How did you get this? Where did this come from? I didn't give it to you. - I... Where did you get this? - I didn't find it. - Who did? - You know, Jack... Maybe you should be writing a children's book. Maybe we should be getting into the publishing game. Dustin, you're an accountant, can you help us with the books? It's what I do, and it will get me out of the house. - OK, excellent. - [all laughing] - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. - I... How did you find this? - Poof! I didn't find it. [Jerry] Even Holly's bakery was about to get a new surge of energy and more business than they could handle. - Oh, thank you Stuart. - For the bakery. - Oh, so cute. - Very precocious. Oh, Holly, you don't understand... Is that...? This was my Great-grandmothers recipe from Ireland. The one I was telling you about. No, that's her handwriting. - I don't get... - Oh, Eva. - Here's one for us. - Oh! [Jerry] Stuart and Ann got the best Mom and Dad they could ever dream of. Oh, it's photos of all of us. Family hug, oh... [Jerry] It looked like, courtesy of Kris, Sienna and Kyle would be spending more time together. Hey, guys, what would you say if we brought some milk and cookies to Kris. [all agreeing] - Kris, we're here. - Kris! - Kris? - Kris? Where is he? - Kris? - Kris? - Where... - Huh... Do you think we should just drop the cookies off with a note? - He didn't forget the red bike! - [all cheering] You know... [Robert] You ride that thing carefully, Stuart. - What do you think? - I don't know. I thought he was going to be here. He invited us. - I think we should go find him. - [man] Where's Kris? [Holly] I agree. - [Eva] Hello. - Merry Christmas, everyone. [all] Merry Christmas. Hey, welcome back. How many families holiday season have you brightened this year? Well, actually, the big company that was giving us donations fell through. So now we are looking for donations from other people. [both] Huh. - Evening everyone. - How are you? - Jack? - Hey, Orson. - Robert. - [Jack] What are you doing here? Did Kris leave already? We didn't even get a chance to say goodbye. - Kris who? - Ahh, Kringle? Kris Kringle, you know... That does sound a little odd. - [Eva] Ho-ho. - Robert, you're so funny. [Robert] What? Ursula might look a little bit like Kris if she grew a beard. Who's Ursula? Ursula is my sister, the interim manager. - Evening everyone. - [Eva] Hello... [Ursula] Hi! Orson... did you come back just to surprise me for Christmas? - No, I just got an early flight. - Oh, well, hi everyone. Oh, look it here, we've got, the Jones and the Carters and the Holdens. Together as usual. You know that family is the most important thing and that children are God's blessings to us. Wait a minute, I just had this conversation with Kris the other day. It's really strange. So what brings you here, Kimberly? - Have we met? - Well, sure. The time the Holdens signed up. Hey, Mom, this one's for you. [Eva] What is it? Read it. "The donation for the organization is out back." Hm... - You guys got to come see this. - [Robert] What? - [Eva] Come on, honey. - Let's go. Yeah, let's go. Wow! - Oh... my... God. - [laughing] - Would you look at that. - And all those presents! - [Eva] Honey! - [Robert] Wow... [Holly] Look at all those presents! Merry Christmas, sweetheart. Wow... [Jack] Did I tell you this place was magic? - [Holly] My entire life. - Ho-ho-ho, Merry Christmas! Kris Kringle. - I knew it was Santa. - Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas, Carters. - Did... Did you? -[Jerry] And... that's my story of how a Christmas Eve miracle brought joy to thousands of families, when it brought our family ever closer together. As Kris Kringle once said: "Family is the greatest gift." Merry Christmas.
