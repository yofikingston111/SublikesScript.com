♪ Oh it's a beautiful time of the year ♪ ♪ when the sky turns to white or the blue disappears ♪ ♪ I can see in your eyes that it's almost here ♪ A clever academic has worked out that finding the 'perfect partner' in life is only one hundred times more likely than being struck by an asteroid. At an early age, I discovered that love is not really that far out of reach. I promised I'd say something witty right now. Grand gestures, declarations of love. Who wouldn't want to hear that? I've always looked for these moments, chased after them. Hey Molly, there's been something I've been meaning to ask now you for a very long time. Yes? Are you going to finish those French fries? The prince swept her into his arms. There was no other place she would rather be. What might seem to be the end is actually only the beginning. I promised I'd say something witty right now. I think you're brilliant. And beautiful. You have the kindest heart of any woman I've ever met. There is no other woman like you. Back then we were too young and innocent I walked away. Hey lovely, how you doing? Never better! A Buckingham affair. A perfect movie for the holidays. - Is that a yes? - Yeah. With gran gone, I need a life more than ever. Molly? What are you doing here? Morning! Since when are you locking the doors? I thought you'd take more time off. Ah no. I couldn't be alone in that house anymore. By the way. What are you doing here? Isn't it your anniversary? Why don't you go get Joyce, rent a ski chalet, drink some champagne, be together! I can take care of everything here. I'm afraid there are more pressing matters. Oh. Okay. I could get started on something. Maybe the community member profile? I had Jodie cover for you. It's already done. Okay, well... Where is Jodie? Where is everyone? You should go home. Robert, look, I promise you I'm fine. I just need to work! That's it. This week is going to be our final edition. Westport post is shutting down. The readers, the money... It's just not there anymore. We were digitizing! We're on track to be... Molly. You're an excellent editor, but you can't change this. No one wants their news at a local level anymore. I'm sorry. It's time to move on. What am I supposed to do so close to the holidays? Pursue your dreams. Harry! No! Molly's life road map. Move to London. Go to dad's old neighborhood. Marry handsome British gentleman. What? Knock knock! Told you didn't need to come by. I'm fine. Exactly. What's wrong? Nothing's wrong! At all. I am changing my plot line. How's that? Look. No great story ever started with... "And then she did nothing, she just hoped for the best and plodded on." Is plodding a thing people still do? My whole life I have been wrapped up in other people's stories. And now with gran gone it's... It's time for me to find my own. So, I am going to the most romantic city in the world. -Paris? -London! What? It's one of the biggest cities in the world. It's brimming with opportunities... And it just happens to be where the 'Buckingham affair' takes place? Molls, I know the last few weeks have been really hard, but just don't rush into things. I'm not rushing. I've been wanting to do this for years. Look. It looks like you wrote that when you were seven! I made some updates. Get job at a reputable publishing house. If I really want to get into publishing, it's just not going to happen here. But in London, even if I got an entry level job at Clarington's, it would be a great step in the right direction. Explore the real London. Yup. I am going to live like a local. I will make it my mission to find things like the best fish and chips shop in London. Apparently it was dad's favorite. Learn more about dad. He grew up in London. Mom and dad fell in love there. Which brings us to number five. Find dashing English gentleman and go on dream date that would make even Jules blossoms blush! That is right universe! I'm putting it out there! So you want to live in a romance novel? Molls... Exactly how many times have you watched that movie? One date! It's no big deal. That's all I want. Okay. After westport's sad offering of what? Teenage crushes and a few half baked boyfriends, I deserve dashing. Yes, dashing, absolutely. But don't get too swept up in this fantasy idea of... You and Jim have been such an inspiration to me. I mean, your wedding was perfection. It was. And I know that your hopes for a baby will happen for you. You found your person. I just want a chance to find mine. Christmastime in London... Sounds perfect. Kind of does. The dentistry is really not that country's strong suit so please don't bring a guy home with a terrible overbite. Where are you going to stay? Oh. Uhhhh... I haven't really gotten that far yet. Richard! Yeah. Yeah, I've got it in front of me right now. Yeah. No. It's all going great. Uh huh. Ah, listen. Do you mind if... Richard? Yeah. It's going great. I'm heading out. Tim's made a curry! You're not going to work all night again, are you? Yeah, unfortunately that's the plan. Yeah. I need to make some coffee. You know you still haven't rsvp'ed to my wedding. I've sent you a few emails. I'm sorry. I'm a few hundred behind. When is it? It's not till December 14th, but you know I've got to get the numbers into the caterers by end of this week. Oh Kate. I've no idea if I have two spare minutes by the end of the day let alone a wedding in a few weeks. Oh, it's all right. I get it. Patrick! What's this? How did I know I'd find you here? Ange! Well, you look... Gorgeous, I know! I got all dressed up for an incredibly hot date I was supposed to have tonight. Yeah, I'm sorry, I’m completely snowed under. Can we reschedule? Ange! I'll make time for us, I promise. I'm afraid you've run out of time. We've only been dating for a few months. Give us a chance. Please. It's happened too many times. I refuse to be passed over again for a load of inane numbers. These "inane numbers" are my living. All right, the flat, the convertible, all that stuff. These numbers are good to me. To us. Your cleaning lady spends more time in that flat than you do! Your life outside of this office barely exists. It's depressing. Ange, I'm sorry about our date. Sometimes that's just the cost of doing business. Well. I hope it's all worth it. Goodbye sweet p. Call me if you ever get a life. Yeah. Get a life. Yeah. Kate! Kate. Yes? RSVP. Patrick Kensington plus no one. Really? You're coming? I take it I can cancel all of your future appointments with ange? Yeah, well. Better yet... First thing when you get in tomorrow, cancel all my plans for the next... Forever. Patrick? Are you all right? Yeah. Know what? Here. An early wedding gift. What are you doing? I'm getting a life. I never wanted this! Personal trainers, home cooks. I've literally been paying people to live my life for me. Ange was right. It's depressing! I thought that I'd have a wife, a family by now. I've been trying to write a book for ages, and I've never had time to get past the title page. If I stay here, I will just work and work and work and work and work and work until I die at that desk. So. But where are you going to go? Anywhere but here. Hmmm. Yeah. Go on then. Don't peek. That's wherever it is. Right. Connecticut? Are you sure? I don't like the idea of someone staying in gran's home. Well it's your house now. And your mortgage. Right, mortgage. Okay. So, free is definitely in my budget. -House swap it is! -Okay. Maybe one more spin. No. No. The globe has spoken. This could be ideal for you. You could try to swap out your flat and end up getting a secluded cabin in the woods. Isn't that every writer's fantasy? I was hoping for something a little more exotic, you know. Oh! All kinds of authors are from there. Mark twain, Arthur Miller. And the woman who wrote those vampire novels was born there. Hmmm. -This is really happening. -Uh huh. This is really happening. This is really happening! Not until you submit it. -Okay. -All right. I've completely forgotten how to flirt! I can't... No! You'd better brush up because you're going to London! -I'm going to London. -Yes! I'm going to London! Oh... yeah! Yay! Oh, look at this! House swap: Westport. Available immediately, until Christmas. Cozy two bedroom farmhouse with fireplace, nestled among trees with private pond. This could be the perfect place for you to write your first novel. Well... It is the complete opposite of London. Yeah. Good. All right. What do I do? Message her. Molly Cooper. Nice to meet you, Patrick Kensington! Dear Patrick. Tomorrow is travel day! Can you even believe it? You have no idea how much I have always wanted to live in London, even if only for a few months. I am beyond excited and cannot thank you enough! Yes, I agree. We should not phone each other except in the direst of emergencies. Phone calls can be too long and intrusive, especially with the time difference. Emails are so handy. And I'll try to get right to the point. No guarantees though. I can rattle on when I'm excited. If you can't tell! I'll leave my house key under the mat for you. I hope you'll feel welcome here, and most of all, comfortable. Happy travels. Molly. Ask for Kate. She'll have the keys for you. Full stop. No, not the words full stop. Just full stop! Best of luck in London, Molly Cooper. Full stop! ♪ I can feel it in my bones ♪ ♪ it's that time of year again ♪ ♪ ah-Ooo gonna sing those songs ♪ ♪ ah-Ooo get the words all wrong ♪ ♪ ah-Ooo put my party hat on ♪ ♪ cos you know you can't change Christmas ♪ So... Big one is for the front door. Let me get you a card. The flat's in top shape, but should you need anything... Thanks. And I think that about covers it. So... -Welcome to London! -Thank you. Are you kidding me! Stop! Okay. Note to self... No red wine in the livingroom. Amazing! Impossible. Impossible! Oh come on. I've managed to swap houses with a woman who can't wrap her head around leaving a key. Molly Cooper. Ne buzzes] Hello? Ms. Cooper, this is... Patrick Kensington! I was just thinking about you. You know, I have to tell you you have the best taste in bedsheets! Ms. Cooper... Please, call me Molly! As much as I'd love to chat about bedsheets, I am currently locked outside your house. Isn't the key under the mat? I can assure you, it's isn't! Hold please. Not to worry! There is a window at the side of the house that doesn't really close properly. You can probably get in there. Brilliant. So it's on the left side of the house, three windows down. It is the smallest window. Harry's still there? I'm sorry, Andy was supposed to pick him up this afternoon but he must be stuck at the store. Look, I promise you I will have Jim come by to get him. What wrong with your dog? He keeps growling at me! Well, to be fair, you are a stranger and you are breaking into my house. Yeah, because you didn't leave a... Was that a good crash or a bad crash? Easy! Easy. Easy. Easy boy. Easy. You know what? Put me on speaker. You are on speaker. Harry! Sit! -Is he sitting? -Yeah. Good boy! Now give him a treat. Easy. Here you go. Everyone loves a biscuit. Ha ha! How are we doing? The attack eyes seem to have subsided. Attack eyes? I guarantee you the only thing he will attack you with is slobbery kisses. And if you rub his belly, he'll be your best friend forever. Right. Well, this has been fun. Listen. Now that you're in, um, I hope you don't feel too... I don't know, off grid? Now don't get me wrong, I love my house, and I know that you will too, but it's not exactly an equal swap. You know? Your home, Umm, appears to have its charms. I'd just appreciate no more surprises. All right? I feel like I am staying in an art gallery! Ugh! I love your sitting room with all of your books. You are quite the reader, aren't you? You know you can tell a lot about a person by what they read. This one time I was... I'm sorry. I've just traveled across the world, I've broken into your home and tamed a wild beast. And my body feels like I haven't slept in days. Fair enough. But please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions. I'm hoping that won't be necessary. Oh, and Umm, good luck with your writing! I got to tell you, it is so exciting to have a novelist staying in my place. I think the last time that someone famous was in it... Patrick? Good night Ms. Cooper. Good night Patrick. Ms. Cooper. "Mizzzzz coopah!" I could get used to that! Right. Dog. All right. Come on. Would you be so kind as to water my plants and tree twice a week? The plants also like to listen to classical music. Maybe something from the nutcracker would suit for the season? To gather fresh eggs from the chickens! This spider's name is Victoria. Don't mind her, though, she keeps to herself, and keeps the flies at bay. Ah! Internet password is... Mister Darcy forever. Bit of an odd one. Mulled wine for when the writing is good. Or when it's bad. Cheers to you! For helping my Christmas dream come true! Dear Molly. Apologies if I was short with you last night. I appreciate you sharing your keen skills for breaking and entering. Thank you for your lovely gift and helpful notes. I am settled now and looking forward to getting to work. Wishing you all the best for your first day in London. Cheers, Patrick. It's so quiet here. Just. Write. Something. Dear Patrick. No need to apologize for my forgetfulness. I'm sorry to have been responsible for a bumpy start to your trip. My first day of exploration has been absolutely thrilling! There's so much to do here, it's a little overwhelming. Now that I've seen most of 'iconic London', I'll need to be more discerning with my time, or I won't have the 'living like a local' experience that I was hoping for. My father grew up here, and I'm so curious as to what his life was like. I'd love any suggestions that you might have for a good fish and chips spot. I'm told that they were his favorite. Eternally hungry, Molly. Certainly we can help her with that. What? It's not procrastination if I'm just pausing momentarily to help a friend. Are we watching the clock because you can't buy sweets until a certain hour? What? Oh. No. I'm just trying not to barge in at the wrong time. Clarington's, I mean. Oh... Clarington's publishing. Yeah. So. What? You some famous author, then? No, uh, no. Still at the 'want to be editor' stage. Oh. Well. Good luck. I'm sure you'll be fine. Thank you. Hi. Um... excuse me. I'm sorry. I emailed my resume. I just wanted to stop by and introduce myself. I'm Molly. Molly Cooper. And I would do anything... If we want to be in touch, we'll be in touch. Right. Wonderful. Umm... It's just that I’m actually only in London until Christmas, and, well, I could even start today! I mean obviously Clarington's is a prestigious publishing house, and I would do, I would do anything to gain even a morsel of experience here. I could intern. I could get coffee, even... Unfortunately, this isn't a self serve window. You don't just turn up here and order the job you want. No, of course not, I didn't think that... I will not be treated like a toddler! It's just a few notes! Darling, you are the Jewel in our crown. It's just all starting to feel a little... -Irrelevant. -Oh, please! I've been writing best sellers since before you were born. Exactly. Times have changed. Millennials are the hot market now. Jules we need you to bring them on board. Jules blossoms! Don't you... no no no no. Sorry. Hi! Oh my gosh! I have read almost all of your books at least a couple hundred times. See? Millennial! Yeah. My gran was a huge fan of yours. She actually taught me to read with your Buckingham affair series. Thank you, I think. And Jules is completely relevant! She's the reason I am in London. Number five on my life road map: "Go on a date with a handsome English gentleman that would make even Jules blossoms blush!" Good luck with that. Well, that is crazy, but quite frankly, far more intriguing than this draft. Jules, you haven't had a best seller in eight years. We both want the same thing. Just bring us a draft with a modern twist and we'll be in business. Excuse me. Jules! I don't do autographs! Some people just don't know when to start teaching. Ahem... ahem! Thanks so much for stopping by. Some crushed dreams today. Let's just say I'm not exactly taking London by storm. You're definitely going to need some green ones. What am I doing here? Dear Molly. A few suggestions for you. "Molly's must see in London." Hampstead hill garden, postman's park, Neal's yard in covent garden but for the very best fish and chips, you must go to malt and chips! Thank you, Patrick! Your enthusiasm about London makes me feel like a bit of a fraud, having lived in the city my whole life, and not fully appreciated it. It's funny how a stranger can make you take a second look. It makes me wish I was there with you seeing it for the first time. Enjoy! "The withdrawal account" by Patrick Kensington. Now... That is the title of a best seller. Yeah? Jeffrey Brandon was no ordinary banker. He was an extra-ordinary... No. That's not good at all, is it? Yeah. That's not very good at all. Yeah, somehow I think this is going to be harder than I thought. Oh, you want to type now? You got a book idea? Patrick! Welcome to America! Sorry I didn't come by earlier. Andy and I have been swamped at the furniture shop. I build 'em, he sells 'em. Hey, you settling in okay? Yeah... Oh, come here Harry. Ah, he's a good boy. Yeah. Who are you mate? I'm Jim. Andy's husband. I'm here to pick up Harry. Oh. I wouldn't want to be responsible for kicking the dog out of his home. Are you sure? Molly said she didn't want him getting in your way. No, we've been getting along quite nicely. Yeah, I always fancied having a dog but I never had time to care of one. So, I think it's a positive solution for both of us. Okay. Well then let's go for a beer. I can show you around the town, introduce you to some people. I sorta just got in the flow of writing. So... Yeah. Better get back to it. Writing huh? About what? It's a novel. It's a thriller set in the banking world. Yeah. Banking? Huh... I don't like banking. But if you can make debt repayment thrilling, sir, you are a genius. I'm trying. Hey. When you need anything, we're the next house over. -The one with the pond. -I'll keep that in mind. Isn't that right, Harry. You know where to find us. Back to it! Oh. Yeah yeah yeah. Sure. Good luck, man. Jim. Hampstead hill... You're right, Patrick Kensington. That was the most beautiful park I've ever seen. Well if you don't have proper milk then I will take my business elsewhere! Ah... we have some. Do you? Yeah, let me just check in the back. Excuse me. Maybe I can help? Oh, well thank you. These American chains have made getting a proper coffee a real challenge. I think what you is a semi shot Espresso flat white. That sounds about right. Okay. Coming right up. You're that American girl from Clarington's. Yes. I was trying to see if I could get an internship. Ah yes. What the world needs is yet another aspiring writer. Where on earth did that man go? Oh, um, you know, I've never actually written a full novel. I work as an editor at a local paper back home. Why must the world not keep itself tidy? You know they were wrong. I mean about your work being out of touch. If you're trying to help here, you're not. It's just... Your characters. They are so real. And your endings are always somehow... It's okay! Your endings are always somehow so surprising and yet inevitable. Maybe just with a few updates... Look. I'm not interested in modern romance. It's boring. It's lazy. Technology has ruined the art of conversation and the element of surprise. A Buckingham affair would never work today. One text, "running late," and the whole story doesn't happen! No but technology can access even more. There's more opportunities because of it. Believe me, I've done my fair share of swiping right, but it's not fodder for great romance. It's not just about dating apps! I am only here with you in this cafe right now because I went online and I swapped my house for a London flat in hopes of meeting a perfect stranger who could quite possibly be my dream date. Did you really travel across the planet to go on a date with some man you've never met? What can I say? Romance is still alive. Tell that to my three ex-husbands. You never know. You're fourth could sweep you off your feet at any moment. Your blind optimism is nauseating. And oddly refreshing. Look. Is your fan-girling going to get in the way of reading a few pages and giving me some feedback? What? Umm... no! No, I promise. Come by my flat on Monday. Ten sharp. Thanks for the coffee. Wow. Hi. All right, Harry. Smile. Harry sends his congrats on conquering the tube! Ohhh! What is it? Patrick just sent me this. It's my dog Harry. Awwww! Good man, Patrick! Also, please don't apologize for your messages. For some reason I didn't expect writing this novel to be such a lonely venture. The ping of your messages always comes as a relief. Happy to be of service. Is this too much? You're texting with Patrick? Yeah, I mean we're just helping each other get settled. Oh. I miss him. But honestly, this swap of yours was the best thing that could've happened to him. I just hope he's able to log off workaholic mode and actually relax a little bit. Is this too much? Ah! You two! How did you two meet? At school. But we didn't date until after university. She finally let me take her out on a proper date, and now, lucky me, I get to spend the rest of my life with my best friend. I'm sorry to say Molly, but the most wonderful man in London is already taken. By me! Got it. Guess where the tube took me today? Malt and chips! And...? It is by far the best fish and chips I've had yet. Although I am not quite ready to crown a champion, it does definitely hold a top spot. Okay. Since your advice has been so spot on this far... Might you be able to tell me where a young lady could go to meet a proper English gentleman? Isn't this setting back the feminist movement a few decades? My whole life I've had my heart set on a dream date night in London. No suitable suitor yet. A man in a nice suit, with manners and a smooth accent? An evening of culture and romance, fancy drinks, live music, the ballet. Hardly asking too much. Molly, I hesitate to offer advice on how to engineer this 'dream date'. I'm not sure it's a good idea. Don't expect that any man who speaks with received pronunciation and wears an expensive three-piece suit will behave like a gentleman. Hey love. You ready to go? Yup yup. I'm sorry. I know that's a grim thing to say about my fellow countrymen, but I do feel responsible. And I'd hate for you to be upset. My best advice is to focus on the city and just let London guide your heart. I'm going on a coffee run. You want anything? Oh, ah, yeah. An americano with soya. Thanks Nico! Ta ta darling. You almost finished? It might help to have more than the first 20 pages, just to know where the story's going. You'll start with the first 20. Okay. So far I think it's great! No, it's "out of touch", remember? Okay, well, you have Benjamin and Emma trying to hail a cab at the corner. Um. Maybe they both order a ride share and happen to get in the same car? No one stands in the rain anymore. Are you kidding me? Your characters are there. And I totally felt like these two wanted to be standing out in the rain. It's not about the cab, it's about getting away from your problems. I'll get you the next 20. Honestly, I don't know why I thought I’d be good at writing a novel. It's always been a dream but... I'm not sure I'm cut out for it. I have no doubt that you're a brilliant writer! Is it maybe possible that you're over-thinking your writing the way that I was over-thinking the tube? Just saying. Maybe you should take a break from work. You know I've heard that walks can be good for writer's block. The unmarked trails around my house can be daunting, so... Harry, do you want to go for a walk? Suit yourself. Jim and I share our morning chores and I'm sure Jim would love the help if you want to do some mucking out. Benny is my favorite horse. ♪ oh, Christmas tree, oh Christmas tree ♪ ♪ how true your leaves unchanging ♪ This is where my parents were married. They died when I was really young. I used to come here to feel close to them. Something about how the wind blows through the trees here, it's magical. I can't believe it but I actually had a moment of homesickness today. Longing for home, Andy and Jim. It's certainly more beautiful here than I had anticipated. Even when it snows. Didn't you say your father was from London? Maybe you're closer to home than you think. There you go. Hello darling. What can I do you for? A pint of... something. You look like a cider girl to me. Coming up! -There you go. -Thank you. I am a perfect judge of the drink. People not so much! You're right. I am a cider girl. Actually I do have a people question though. All right. I'm, ah, I'm looking for some information on my dad. He grew up on this street. Oh, if he lived around here, this would be his local. You're Charlie's girl! You knew my dad? My stars! You look exactly like him. Me and Charlie, we was the best of mates! Look, can you come round on Saturday night? And I'll have some cover behind the bar and we can have a nice chat. That would be great! Thank you. Charlie's girl. Ah! This isn't any good. What do you mean it's not any good? You were right. Home was a lot closer than I thought. -Jim. -Patrick! Hey, man. How're you doing? Good. Good. How're you doing? Good. Ah, question. Um... Molly said that I could come over and borrow a snowblower? Oh sure. Right over there. -Ah...? -Yeah. You know how to operate that thing? Yeah, you just, like... You've never seen one in your life. I haven't. I better give you a hand. Here you go. Pages 60 through 80! Thanks. You've met your British gent. Sorry? For your dream date. Oh. No. Not yet. Then what you so smiley about? You look exhausted, but you're chipper than ever. I don't know. I'm having a Christmas party at my club. A select few friends but there will be some glittery guests coming. You're helping with my novel, I'll help with your life road map. I'm sorry. Was that an invite to... Got it. So don't worry about the chickens. Okay they don't bite. They all have their own personalities. So you got to study them to get the right approach. That's the trick. Ah... I'll be there in a second. Tonight I meet my English gentleman! Oh, beautiful work! Yeah, that was a good day. Today is a good day! Any last words of advice? Take care. Take care? What am I her brother? All right. Thank you. I appreciate that. I appreciate you. Hey! You okay over there? -I've just spoken with Molly. -Oh good. Tonight she's meeting British gents. Oh! Good for her. She deserves the best. She has been so great helping Jim and I out with our adoption papers. I mean, she's a super star! Yeah. She is. That kid's been through a lot. Yeah, she mentioned her parents. Yeah, she, um, she also recently lost her gran. She was running the farm with her. They were like peas and carrots. It's been really hard on her. Yeah. I guess she feels quite alone in the world? She is but, you know, she's got Jim and me and eternal optimism. You never know, she might just meet that handsome Brit she's been dreaming about. -Yeah. -You never know. I wish her all the best. Good to see you darling. Several eligibles here tonight. Oh, let me introduce you to Matthew. Matthew, Molly. Molly, Matthew. Have fun. So, what is it you do Holly? Oh... it's Molly. That accent! How quaint. I'm American. What do you say we take this conversation to the mistletoe? Oh look. Umm. Excuse me. Playing coy? No. I think I just didn't have the right opener. Not to worry. We'll find you your perfect English gentleman. But hands off of Raymond. He's mine. What about Nico? Oh darling. I don't do relationships anymore. Writing romance is easy, living it is a constant disappointment. Sorry. How do you write such beautiful stories if you don't believe in them? It's called imagination. Fantasy. I give readers what they want, but can't have in their own lives. Oh! Excuse me. -Molly Holly. -Oh, it's you. So what do you say? Do you want to get out of here? Actually, yes. Um... Not with you. Okay. Can we jam now? Yeah. When the alarm goes off. Right? That was the rule! Ten minutes of jamming and ten minutes of finance. Fine. I think I've found a way for you to pay off these credit card debts because the interest, it's killing you. There's no point in saving money if you're just losing more money in interest, right? Okay. That makes sense. You know, you're actually saving my life here. Andy and the adoption agency are going to be really impressed. I'm just glad I could... Ah ah ah! Jam time. Come on! Get over here. Let's go. Pick up that bass man. Let's go. Yeah yeah yeah. I'm a bass player. You are today. -Oh! Sorry. -Sorry. How is it in there? Oh, it's nice. It's just not my cup of tea. You're American? Yeah.

The newbie gets the crown! ♪ On Christmas day ♪ ♪ you'll find it on Christmas day ♪ It's like a financial mystery... Patrick. We're heading home. Already? Well. It's almost eleven o'clock! Nothing good happens at a party after eleven. You see, I gotta get my cookie here home for some rest. Hey, we're going to swing by and grab Harry, if that works for you. Yeah, brilliant. Yeah. I should be back from London on Monday. Good. Say hi to Molly for us. You think that she'd want to see me? Are you kidding? She'd love to meet the mystery man staying at her house! Uh huh! Good night, Patrick. Good night. Yeah, I mean London is cool, right, but it's not the states. Maybe that's what I love about it! It's different. The culture, the architecture. Yes, it's beautiful. You're beautiful. And so not like the last woman I dated. -Oh no? -No. She was... 'Oh so British.' she was obsessed with romance. Would not stop talking about it. I never need to hear ' Hey Brad let's go somewhere romantic' ever again in my life. You want to get some food? Sorry. I have to go. I have a date with the bartender. Enjoy your food. Oh, no! Look at his hair! Your father considered himself a trendsetter. Ahead of his time! He totally would fit in on the streets of London today, huh? Charlie was quite the character. And boy, he loved your mother. He should be thanking me. It was my idea to go down to the pub that night. The pub? Yeah. The night they met. Don't you know the story? Yeah. I know it really well. They were at the library... Your father and your mother found themselves in the same aisle, reaching for the same dusty book, at the exact same moment. And when their hands touched, it was magical. Library? Charlie wouldn't have been seen dead in a library. Rest in peace, Charlie boy. So they fell in love in a pub? This one! I dragged Charlie down here to play trivia. He was a useless partner. And once he caught sight of your mum, that was it, I was on me own. None of us dreamt that I’d be landlord here one day. Maybe Charlie wouldn't have lost touch if he knew I could give him a brewery discount. Cheers. Cheers. To you. Molly, it's entirely too early! And now I don't know what to believe! Gran told me the story of how they met hundreds of times, word for word for years! The quiet library in Leeds, How they both found themselves in the same aisle, reaching for the same book. What book? A book on ancient ruins! It was beautiful. You couldn't have written anything better. I hate to be the one to tell you this. You said your gran was my biggest fan. One of my best sellers. I love a library love story. Come in. You made it! Wow! Straight from the airport. Am I too wrinkly? No, look at you. You're like a new man! I feel like a new man. Dare I say the time off has been good for me? I don't know if I've ever actually seen you smile before. Stop. I've met someone. I mean sort of. It's complicated. My flat swapper, Molly... Oh! She's lovely. -You two been hanging out? -Yeah. You should have brought her! Well, I mean... We haven't actually met yet. But we've sent emails and loads of texts, but listen... It's not about me. It's your wedding day. No, you've got to meet her! I want to but now that I'm actually here, I'm not sure it's such a great idea. Well, you're welcome to stay after the ceremony and dance with my drunk uncle Dan, but something tells me that you'd have a better time if you spent it with Molly. We had a business agreement. Didn't involve me just showing up unannounced. Patrick. You're here! So why wouldn't you go and see her for yourself? What if she doesn't want to see me? What's the worst that could happen? The two of you meet, and she might actually feel the same way about you? Look Patrick, please, go to her. Be as happy as Tim and I are. Okay? All right. Yeah. Thanks. After the wedding. -You look gorgeous. -Thank you. Patrick, where are you? Go away! What? Uh. Hi! Are you okay? Pretty sure you have the wrong flat. Positive I don't. I'm... Look. Patrick's not here. He's in America. Uh, well... -I'm sorry. -No, I'm sorry. I, I should just... No wait. I'm being rude. Any friend of Patrick's is a friend of mine. I'm Molly. Yeah. Molly. I'm Patrick...'S friend... Peter. Peter... Kirkland. Sorry, Peter Kirkland. -Pleased to meet you. -You too. Um, listen, Molly... Would you care to have a drink with me? Oh, um... Yeah, sure. Please. So you brought Patrick a Rose? Ah... yeah. Yeah I did. Are you two...? Ah, no no no no no. Wow, no. Um, just an old school boy prank. Yeah. Old joke. Old tradition. That's all. Yeah. Okay. Oh. I didn't think Patrick would mind. I love Christmas trees. My gran and I always decorated them together. I actually put one in my place for Patrick. We did this house swap thing. I'm surprised he didn't tell you. I love it. I'm sure he will too. Yeah. Well, I just need five minutes. Uh huh. Idiot! Idiot! Idiot! You okay out there? Uh, yeah. All good! Patrick, you are not going to believe this. The most handsome British gentleman just showed up at your flat! He says he's your friend. Peter Kirkland. What am I doing? What am I doing here? Don't. It'll break her heart. Okay, I'm almost ready! Molly, I have to tell you you... You look stunning. The dog pajamas were a marvel, but um... Yeah, um... Shall we? Yeah. The cocktail list reads like science fiction! Yeah, um... What do you think? Rosemary smoke or essence of bacon? I think I'd just prefer a plate of bacon. Ah, that can be arranged. Pardon me can I... No, please stop! Please have a heapin' plate of bacon for the lady. Please stop! So, Peter, what is it that you do? Ah... I'm in banking. Oh! Like Patrick! Yeah, very much like Patrick. Well I hope you don't overwork yourself like he does. He's so hard on himself. Yeah. I know he's trying to change that. Um... Molly. How's London been so far? It's been, it's been a roller coaster. I've dreamt about it my whole life, and it's been absolutely amazing. I came with this list of things that I wanted to accomplish, and nothing has gone to plan. But somehow it's all just... Sometimes it's better that way. Yeah. And luckily I have Patrick. He's been amazing. He's so nice and supportive. He actually talked me through taking the tube. Which I was terrified of. And he sent me a list of hidden gems that I probably would have never seen. He's probably tired of hearing from me by now. I highly doubt that anyone could ever get tired of you. Anyway... In school I was banished to the tuba section, but recently taken up the bass guitar. Oh? Are you any good? No, I'm rubbish. But surprisingly, that's half the fun. What about your family. Are you close? My father was in finance as well. One day, I was five years old, and he took me to see big Ben. And he said, "son that there's your life ticking away. "None of us know how much time we've been allotted. Time is precious, so use it wisely." That was dad. That's an awfully grim message for a little boy. Yeah, I guess. Yeah. But it stuck. So does that mean you don't waste any time? Well. My whole life I've been trying to use each minute in a productive way. It wasn't until recently I've realized I've devoted all my time to entirely the wrong things. Well, you should try living on a cozy farm in a small town. Does time stand still on this cozy farm of yours? Yeah. It can if you let it. Patrick, he is so perfectly lovely. Absolutely nice. Can this actually be happening? I'm seeing him again tomorrow. Tell me. Be honest. Is Peter Kirkland too good to be true? Patrick, why aren't you texting me back? Wow! Not going to lie. Those are pretty tiny. Yes. That's why they bring heaps of them. You know, I have dreamt about this city ever since I was young. I have only seen it in romantic movies and now... I mean, now it's real! It's really real! -Yeah. -You think it's silly. No. I was... I was just thinking how happy I am we met. I can't believe this. I mean, just two days ago I found out that the story that my gran always told me about how my parents met, right, the story that set the romantic standards to which I held every single relationship... It was nothing more than fiction. And I was devastated. And now here you are. Why was that story so important? Well, it's all I really have of them. I just feel like maybe the fantasy of that story it... Gave me hope, you know, that anything is possible. Maybe that's why your gran told you that story. How did you parents meet? Apparently it was at the queens crown during trivia night on Christmas Eve. Garret told me the real story. Garret? Who's garret? He was a friend of my dad's. They grew up together I'd love to meet him. -Really? -Yeah. You know what? Yeah, I would. Let's do it now! Yeah, I'm gagging to have a proper pie. -Okay! -Yeah. Come on. -Yeah! Let's do it. -Grab a sandwich. Here. You need some too. Hello. I see you're making a new friend. Garret, this is Peter. I was telling him about my parents. Oh, listen. I found some more photos here. This is one when me and Charlie decided to form a rock band because we thought it would make it easier to pull the birds. What about the birds? -He means women. -Oh. And this is one of Charlie and your mum. Look at how happy they are! Like the only two people in the room. Looks to me like they didn't need the 'fantasy'. Their love was real. Thank you for sharing these with me. Oh no no no no no. You keep them. I got plenty of memories of Charlie up here. Thank you. These have been hands down the best few days. Yeah. For me too. Would you stay for a drink? I absolutely want to, but I’m... What's wrong? I'm sorry Molly. I can't do this. I'm not who you think I am. You're married. You're married aren't you? I knew you were too good to be true! Of course you're married! I'm not married! I'm Patrick. Patrick Kensington. No you're not. Yeah... Jim, Andy and Harry say hello. I had to come back to London for Kate's wedding, and I couldn't get you off my mind. Why would you lie to me? I was trying to surprise you! But when I arrived you were all upset and I realized it wouldn't be your ideal dream meeting scenario. And I panicked! And I was suddenly terrified that I wouldn't measure up to be this "ideal gentleman". I trusted you! I confided in you, and you used that against me. No I wanted you to have your dream date because I... Because what? You felt sorry for me? Because I was falling for you, Molly! I just wanted you to be happy. I'm such a fool. The fancy drinks, the caring talks. None of that was real! No! Yeah, I gave you a different name, yeah, but the rest of it, my feelings for you are real. No. Get out of your house. New life road map. Eat weight in cheese and wine. Consider adding chocolates. Ugly cry only in private. Pack sunglasses for discreet tears in public spaces. I can't accept those. Because I’m allergic to lies. -Hey Patrick. -Hi. Um... Andy thinks it's best that Harry stays with us now. Oh. Yeah. Dude. Yeah? What happened over there? Well I fell in love with her. And then I completely ruined it. I don't know, molls, I honestly don't think what he did is all that bad. He lied to me! He wanted to give you your dream date. It's actually pretty romantic. I can't believe you're not taking my side on this. Hon, I'm always taking your side. He royally messed up! But we're the ones who suggested he meet you. His eyes lit up every time he mentioned your name. You can't fake that. Urgh! We had the best time. You wouldn't stop talking about how wonderful he was. He was wonderful. Incredibly wonderful! It wasn't real! Right? Hey, buddy. Harry missed you, so ten minute chat, ten minute jam? I brought egg nog. Andy said Molly was pretty upset. So that's it. I just get on a plane. Forget I met the love of my life. Beg for my soul sucking job back and analyze investments until the end of time. Well. What about your writing? I'm a banker. I'm not a novelist. You're like a genius with numbers and managing other people's money. Our adoption would be in serious trouble if it weren't for your advice. Jim... You're a genius mate! Yeah, I know. I could write a practical step by step guide to finance for our generation. Yeah! I'd buy that book! Well, you'd give me that book because I gave you the idea. Hey baby! You're not going to believe what... I have news! Sarah chose us. We're having a baby! Hey hey! It's a Christmas Eve day miracle! What what what? Hold on, baby, I'm coming! I'm coming! Andy spoke with the agency. They mother we met... She chose us. -We're getting a baby! -You're getting a baby! Yes! Jim Jim Jim. We're having a baby now. I was signing the papers when Sarah's water broke. We're at the hospital. See you soon. Dad to be. Breathe, man, breathe. It's good. This is all good. Here. You drive me to the hospital. I've had way too much eggnog. Okay? I haven't driven in years! It's okay. It's an American truck. They practically drive themselves. That is one mighty, thoughtful look. Patrick was right. It can't always be like it is in gran's romance novels. Hang on hang on hang on. Who's Patrick? That is a whole cider-explanation. One cider coming up. Thanks. It's Andy! Hi little lady! Andy, she is precious. Yeah. It's a Christmas miracle. The agency said we were Sarah's first pick. Must have been the well written reference you did for us. Well she is lucky to have such wonderful parents. You were almost born on our front porch, weren't you? Patrick was a real life saver. What? Patrick is still there? He left an hour ago. You two haven't talked? No. He hasn't called me back. I think I waited too long. And at this point, he's probably thinking, why bother, you know? It's just easier to go back to our old lives and pretend like it never happened. I'm sorry molls. Me too. But hey, I could not be happier for you and Jim, okay. I can't wait to meet her. I'll see you soon. Bye. So he flies across the planet, pretends to be someone else, takes you on your dream date, you find out he's him, kick him out of his own house, and then what? Then what happens? I don't know. -Ms. Blossoms! -Call Gillian. Jules, I don't have time right now. This will just take a minute. Jules, darling. Gillian, darling. I assume you got the latest draft? I knew you had another best seller in you. I loved it. Loved every page! Well if you want even one page of this book or any other book I ever write published at Clarington's, you'll set Molly here up with a job in your New York office. She will be editing all of my future novels. Absolutely. Um... Molly, was it? Ah, we were just looking at your package and we loved it! I don't know if I'm up for the job. You are a hell of a good editor. And you've succeeded in making me blush. I've no doubt you'll be making millions of readers blush too. I ruined my own happily ever after. Then re-write it. You are in control of your own story, Molly Cooper! You're right. Thank you. Thank you. So, let's talk about this book. All right. Harry? I'm home. Harry? Merry Christmas, Molly. Welcome home. Don't worry. Harry is with Jim and Andy. I've watered your plants and they're still alive! Note new growth. Victoria has a new friend. I've named him Albert. Champagne and chocolates for the eternally hungry. This window now closes properly. Individuals who wish to break and enter are out of luck. What is this? The reasons why I must see Molly Cooper again. To tell her how sorry I am for stuffing things up in London. To explain that I would never willingly hurt her. To tell her that her emails have brightened my days. ...Brightened my days. And my nights. To tell her that meeting her in person has changed me. To tell her that I need to kiss her again. And again. And again. Patrick? How are you, Molly? I'm fine. Thank you. Have you settled in? Not quite yet. I've been a little busy cleaning up this mess. Mess? Yes. There was someone staying here, and he's left little pieces of paper everywhere. It's been a nightmare. Well, that's thoughtless. I'm sorry. That fellow owes you an apology. No! No he doesn't owe me an apology. I loved the notes. Where are you? You weren't on your flight. How do you know that? I waited for you. I really wanted to see you before I left. Well, that's too bad. 'Cause I wanted to be here when you got back. As a present. A real Christmas present. You're here? Take a look out by the arbor. I love you, Molly! I love you. Merry Christmas. -Here you go. -Is that what I think it is? Thank you. Yeah. Raised pages, as requested. Now I do love you, I'm not going to take it easy on you. All right? I'm still going to be a tough editor. I'll be back on Friday. I can't wait. Um. Harry and I will just be here just writing away. Okay. Friday can't come soon enough.
