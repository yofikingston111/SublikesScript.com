NO, I DECIDED THAT I HAD TO COME DOWN HERE BECAUSE I HAVE SOME GREAT NEWS -- SO GREAT THAT I BIT THE BULLET AND BOUGHT A PLANE TICKET AND CAME DOWN HERE TO TELL YOU BOTH IN PERSON. SO WHEN THE BOUTIQUE CLOSED, I MIGHT HAVE TAKEN A COUPLE LOOKBOOKS, AND LAST WEEK, I SHOWED THEM, PLUS EVERY PIECE OF THE KRISTIN PARSON COLLECTION THAT I OWN TO THE BOSSES AT THE DEPARTMENT STORES. BUT -- BUT -- BUT WHY? BECAUSE YOU ARE A DESIGNER, AND YOU NEED A PLACE TO DESIGN. AND, KRISTIN? THEY'RE GONNA GIVE YOU ONE. I DON'T UNDERSTAND. BUTLER WANTS TO BRING YOUR LINE TO THEIR STORES.

EM, WAIT! ♪ WELL, IF IT ISN'T EMILY PARSON FROM LOS ANGELES. YEAH, EXACTLY, THAT'S THE PROBLEM. DID I MISS SOMETHING? YOU SAID IT WAS OKAY TO CHANGE MY CHRISTMAS WISH, BUT...IT FEELS LIKE YOU'RE GRANTING THE FIRST WISH -- THE ONE I DON'T WANT ANYMORE. I'M GRANTING YOUR WISH? IT'S OKAY, THOMAS. I THINK I FINALLY FIGURED OUT WHO YOU REALLY ARE. OH, HAVE YOU? WELL, YOU LOOK JUST LIKE HIM, AND YOU WERE MY ONLY FRIEND WHEN I WAS ALL ALONE. OKAY, THEN. IF YOU REALLY THINK I'M SAINT NICK, WHY WOULD I BE WORKING AS A CUSTODIAN? HAVEN'T FIGURED THAT OUT YET. BUT...I'M MORE WORRIED ABOUT THE CHRISTMAS WISH I MADE. OH, HOW SO? WHEN I MOVED HERE, I WROTE A LETTER TO SANTA ASKING HIM TO HELP ME GO BACK TO L.A. BUT THEN I STARTED WRITING A NEW WISH. WITH YOUR SONG? IS... IS THE PROBLEM THAT I WASN'T TOTALLY HONEST? WHAT DO YOU MEAN? I SAID THAT I WANTED MOM TO FALL IN LOVE WITH MR. COLLIER BECAUSE SHE WOULD BE HAPPY, AND I DO. I MEAN IT. BUT ALSO, I DON'T WANT TO MOVE BACK TO L.A. THE LONGER I'M HERE, THE MORE I LIKE IT. I HAVE A SOLO IN THE SNOWFLAKE PAGEANT. MR. COLLIER'S THE BEST SINGING TEACHER I'VE EVER HAD, AND MOM AND ME HAVE DINNER TOGETHER EVERY NIGHT. YOU KNOW WHAT? I THINK I KNOW WHAT YOUR PROBLEM IS. YOU MAILED THAT FIRST LETTER, RIGHT? YES. BUT YOU HAVEN'T SUNG YOUR SONG YET. UNTIL YOU DO, YOU HAVEN'T REALLY MADE YOUR NEW WISH. SO YOU MEAN WHEN I DO... WELL, I'M NOT MAKING ANY PROMISES, EMILY. WISHES ARE SPECIAL AND HAVE TO BE CAREFULLY CONSIDERED. BUT DEEP DOWN, YOU HAVE A VERY IMPORTANT DECISION TO MAKE. WHAT IS IT YOU REALLY WANT? I HAVE A FEELING THAT ONCE YOU SING YOUR SONG, EVERYTHING'S GONNA WORK OUT JUST THE WAY YOU WANT.
