THE HERALD ANGELS SING ♪ ♪ GLORY TO THE NEWBORN KING ♪ OKAY, THIS IS IT. I NEED A STORY FOR THE CHRISTMAS ISSUE THAT REALLY POPS, AND ALL I GOT IS AN EMPTY CHAIR. I'VE GOT TWO PULITZER PRIZE WINNERS, A PEN AWARD WINNER, AND TWO BEST-SELLING NOVELISTS ON MY STAFF. SO I ASKED THEM FOR SOME STORY IDEAS. THEY LOOK AT ME LIKE I'M THE GHOST OF CHRISTMAS PAST. I'M SERIOUS. YOU GET ME RIGHT, LENA? THERE'S A LOT THAT'S GOING ON IN THE WORLD RIGHT NOW, AND PEOPLE NEED A BREAK FROM ALL THAT NOISE. I KNOW I CERTAINLY DO. I ABSOLUTELY AGREE. I WAS JUST HOPING THAT ONE OF THEM WOULD VOLUNTEER. I COULD FORCE ONE OF THEM, YOU KNOW? I'M NOT SURE THAT WOULD BE IN THE CHRISTMAS SPIRIT. HMM. I-I MEAN... JUST THAT, UH... I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN, AND YOU'RE RIGHT. JUST LIKE I'M RIGHT ABOUT THIS CHRISTMAS STORY. I COULD FEEL IT IN MY GUT. MY GUT IS NEVER WRONG. I WANT NEWS IN THIS NEXT ISSUE. AND I WANT THIS CHRISTMAS STORY TO HAVE, YOU KNOW, THE VIBRANT WAY WITH LIFE, STYLE, SOUL. I COULD WRITE IT. YOU? DID YOU READ THAT WRITING SAMPLE THAT I SENT YOU YET? THE ONE ABOUT THAT SOCIAL WORKER IN THE TENDERLOIN? LENA, I KNOW YOU DON'T WANT TO BE MY ASSISTANT FOREVER. SO YOU DID READ IT. UM... VIVIAN. WHAT? READ IT TONIGHT. PLEASE? IF YOU DON'T THINK IT'S ANY GOOD, I WON'T MENTION IT AGAIN. AND WHAT IF I DO THINK IT'S GOOD? LET ME WRITE YOUR CHRISTMAS STORY. OH, WOW. OH, THAT'S A BIG LEAP, LENA. FROM MY ASSISTANT TO A FEATURE ARTICLE. I CAN DO THIS, VIVIAN. I PROMISE YOU. I'LL CALL YOU TONIGHT. YEAH. OH, BABY, I'M SO PROUD OF YOU. IT'S NOT DEFINITE YET. NOW, LOOK, WHAT DO I ALWAYS SAY? GET UP. STAND UP, GET UP, STRUT. YOU GOT THIS. I STILL HAVE TO THINK OF SOMETHING. I MEAN, IF SHE LIKES MY SAMPLE STORY. DO YOU THINK SHE WILL? NOW, SHE STRIKES ME AS A VERY BRIGHT WOMAN. NOW, IF SHE CAN'T SEE THIS LIGHT IN YOU, THEN YOU JUST GOT TO SHINE BRIGHT UNTIL SOMEBODY ELSE DOES. BUT I HAVE A FEELING SHE'LL BE CALLING. OH. HELLO? HEY, MAYA. YEAH. OH? OH. OH, THAT'S WONDERFUL NEWS. WELL, YEAH, OF COURSE SHE CAN. COME ON. HE'S GONNA BE FAMILY. OH, OKAY. WELL, CONGRATULATIONS. THAT'S AMAZING. OKAY, YEAH. OKAY, I'LL SEE YOU THEN. OH. YOUR COUSIN JUNE IS GETTING ENGAGED. SHE'S BRINGING HER FIANCé TO THE CHRISTMAS PARTY. HERE I THOUGHT I'D BE BRINGING MY FIANCé TO THE CHRISTMAS PARTY. OH, NOW, WAIT A MINUTE. JUST WAIT A MINUTE. THAT WAS SIX MONTHS AGO. I KNOW IT'S NOT EASY BEING SINGLE AT CHRISTMAS, BUT I ALSO KNOW THAT THE RIGHT PERSON FOR A WONDERFUL WOMAN LIKE YOU IS STILL OUT THERE. BUT WHAT IF HE WAS THE ONE, MOM? THE ONE? GIRL, WHAT AM I GONNA DO WITH YOU? DAD WAS YOUR ONE, RIGHT? AND GRANDMA FOR GRANDPA. THOSE TWO. DAD AND MOM. YEAH. IF THERE WERE EVER TWO PEOPLE MEANT TO BE TOGETHER, IT WAS THEM. MM. THEY'RE TOGETHER FOREVER NOW. TOUGH YEAR. YEAH. FIRST CHRISTMAS WITHOUT THE BOTH OF THEM. BUT WE'VE STILL GOT TO CELEBRATE, RIGHT? YES. OKAY. OH, BABY, NOW, THERE'S A FAVOR I WANT TO DO FOR ME. THERE'S A BUNCH OF POP'S STUFF. WE PUT IT UP IN THE ATTIC. I'M GONNA GO THROUGH ALL OF IT SOMEDAY, BUT THERE'S A SANTA HE USED TO PUT ON THE PORCH. IT'S UP THERE SOMEWHERE. THAT SANTA? YES. NOW, COULD YOU GO UP THERE AND JUST TRY TO FIND IT? IT'LL SORT OF BE LIKE HE'S STILL HERE. OKAY. THANK YOU. HMM. "MY LIFE, LOVE AND SOUL." A CHRISTMAS FOR MARY. "ALWAYS, CLARENCE." MM. WOW, GRANDPA'S PALETTE. WONDER KIND OF MUSIC HE LISTENED TO. LOOK HOW HANDSOME HE WAS. WHAT'S THIS? GRANDPA'S JOURNAL. YOU'RE NOT GRANDMA. YOU MUST BE MARY. ALOHA, SANTA CLAUS. I STILL REMEMBER WHEN MOM AND DAD BROUGHT HIM BACK FROM HAWAII. I WAS IN COLLEGE. THEN I WENT AWAY TO COLLEGE, AND MOM AND DAD STARTED ACTING LIKE THEY WERE A COUPLE OF COLLEGE KIDS AGAIN. SMELLS LIKE CHRISTMAS. YOUR FAVORITE PIES IN THE OVEN. ALRIGHT, NOW, APPLE CRUMBLE. THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. AHH. I SEE YOU FOUND CLARENCE'S SANTA. THOUGHT I'D HIDDEN HIM BETTER THAN THAT. JUST KIDDING. I'M GLAD YOU BROUGHT HIM OUT. WHAT'S THAT, LENA? I FOUND THIS, TOO. IT WAS WITH SOME OTHER PAINTINGS. OH, THE PAINTINGS. DAD'S OTHER LIFE. YOUR GRANDPA, HE WAS A TRUE RENAISSANCE MAN. SHE'S BEAUTIFUL. MM. I MEAN, NOT AS BEAUTIFUL AS YOU, OF COURSE. DOESN'T LOOK MUCH LIKE YOUR MOM, THOUGH. THAT'S DEFINITELY NOT MOM. "MY LIFE, LOVE AND SOUL." A CHRISTMAS FOR MARY. "ALWAYS, CLARENCE." WHAT? THAT'S WHAT IT SAID. WELL, WHO IS MARY? YOU KNOW. IT'S YOUR DAD. I FOUND THIS, TOO. I THINK THIS IS HER. - THAT'S HER, ALRIGHT. - HMM. - HMM. STOP IT. - WHAT? HMM. I KNOW WHAT HMM IS. THIS IS NOT A HMM. THIS IS... WHAT? NOT A HMM. DO YOU THINK IT'S SOMEBODY THAT GRANDPA WAS DATING? I SAID IT'S NOT A HMM. I DIDN'T KNOW THAT'S WHAT A "HMM" WAS. LOOK, IT'S ALRIGHT FOR YOUR DAD TO HAVE ANOTHER GIRLFRIEND. THIS IS NOT ANOTHER GIRLFRIEND. BABY... HMM? ALL FAMILIES HAVE SECRETS. YEAH, MAYBE YOUR SIDE. NOW, DEBBIE, YOUR DAD WOULD BE THE FIRST TO ADMIT THAT HE HAD A PRETTY SPIRITED YOUTH. LOOK, MOM AND DAD WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL TOGETHER. BUT YOU SAID THEY GOT MARRIED AFTER HIGH SCHOOL. DID YOUR GRANDDAD EVER TELL YOU THAT STORY ABOUT HARLEM JAZZ CLUB? NO, GRANDPA, JAZZ CLUB? MOM WAS WITH HIM THEN. SHE CALMED DAD DOWN FOR THE BETTER. HE MENTIONED THAT ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION. BUT SHE DOES LOOK ABOUT 20-SOMETHING, DOESN'T SHE? SHE'S SOMETHING. I GIVE YOU THAT. STOP. DAD. OH. PINEVILLE. PINEVILLE? YEAH, I BET YOU ANYTHING, THAT'S WHERE THIS PHOTO WAS TAKEN. IT'S A LITTLE TOWN ABOUT THREE OR FOUR HOURS AWAY FROM HERE. THERE'S A TRAIN STOP THERE, AND IT'S KIND OF HIDDEN AWAY. YEAH, DAD USED TO STOP THERE WHEN HE WAS TRAVELING AND WRITING, PAINTING. WHAT ELSE DID HE SAY ABOUT IT? IT'S LIKE HE MARKED HIS LIFE BEFORE PINEVILLE AND AFTER. I NEVER KNEW EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED THERE. HE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT IT MUCH, BUT HE MENTIONED IT A COUPLE OF TIMES VAGUELY WHEN I WAS GROWING UP. THAT ALWAYS STUCK WITH ME, THOUGH. THE LAST CHRISTMAS IN PINEVILLE. DO YOU THINK IT'S POSSIBLE THAT HE MIGHT HAVE FALLEN IN LOVE WHEN HE WAS IN PINEVILLE? WELL, I NEVER THOUGHT MY DAD HAD EYES FOR ANYBODY BUT MY MOM, BUT... WHAT WAS HE WORKING ON IN PINEVILLE? I'M NOT SURE. BUT, YOU KNOW, I KNOW THAT HE STARTED WORKING AT THE "EAST BAY TIMES" SOON AFTER. "CHRISTMAS IN PINEVILLE"? HMM. YOUR GRANDFATHER WROTE THOUSANDS OF STORIES IN HIS LIFE. YOU PROBABLY KNOW SOME OF THEM BETTER THAN I DO. BUT WITH HIS CRAZY SHORTHAND, IT'S HARD TO PUT ANYTHING TOGETHER, ESPECIALLY STUFF THAT'S DECADES OLD. THE WAY YOU KEEP YOUR JOURNAL, YOU REMIND ME OF HIM. - "25 - K SAVINGS, ONE-BEDROOM APARTMENT IN THE CITY. WRITER AT VIBRANT." IS THIS YOUR CHRISTMAS LIST? GOAL. AND WHEN I THINK ABOUT ALL THAT GRANDPA ACCOMPLISHED BY MY AGE, I MEAN, ALREADY PUBLISHED, WRITING, PAINTING. I DON'T EVEN KNOW ABOUT THE JAZZ CLUBS. YOU'LL MAKE YOUR OWN WAY IN YOUR OWN TIME. NOW, WAIT. NOW, WHAT'S THIS? IN GRANDPA'S JOURNAL, IN BETWEEN THE SHORT STORIES AND THE CRAZY SHORTHAND, I FOUND SOMETHING ELSE. DID HE EVER MENTION A CRIME STORY HE WAS COVERING IN PINEVILLE? CRIME? MY DADDY DID A LOT OF REPORTING LIKE THAT. I KNOW FOR THE PAPER, HE COVERED EVERYTHING. BUT... I'M SO SORRY. I ALWAYS MEANT TO GET HIM TO OPEN UP ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED IN PINEVILLE, BUT I NEVER DID. HMM. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT A STORY, AND I KNOW FOR CERTAIN HE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING TO ME ABOUT A LOVE AFFAIR. YEAH. HE MENTIONS THIS MARY IN THE JOURNALS, BUT ONLY IN BITS, FRAGMENTS. CHRISTMAS IN PINEVILLE. IT'S LIKE HE HAD ANOTHER LIFE. THAT'S WHAT I'M WORRIED ABOUT. WELL, EXACTLY WHAT DID HE SAY? WERE THEY... THERE'S NOT A LOT OF REAL DETAILS, AT LEAST WHAT I COULD MAKE OUT. WELL, THAT'S A PRETTY BIG DETAIL. I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW. WHAT IF... WHAT IF HE AND THIS OTHER WOMAN... OH, I JUST WISH I KNEW FOR SURE. ME TOO. IT'S VIVIAN. YOU GOT THIS. VIVIAN? YOU'VE GOT HEART, YOU'RE RAW, BUT YOU'RE TALENTED. I AM? Drop the question mark, Lena. YOU NEED TO BUILD CONFIDENCE, AND I'M GONNA GIVE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT. YOU ARE? I MEAN, YES, YOU ARE. THATAGIRL. NOW, TO PROVE THAT YOU'RE NOT A FLUKE, I'M GONNA GIVE YOU A CRACK AT THE CHRISTMAS STORY. And if you deliver, I'm gonna put you on staff first of the year. YOU'RE GONNA PUT ME ON STAFF? I MEAN, YOU WILL PUT ME ON STAFF. I GOT TO SEE YOUR STORY FIRST. NOW, WHAT DO YOU GET? THE LAST CHRISTMAS IN PINEVILLE. OKAY, NICE LOCATION. LOVE STORY? I'M NOT SURE. I FOUND THIS PORTRAIT MY GRANDPA PAINTED OF THIS WOMAN. OOH. AND THIS WOMAN, NOT YOUR GRANDMOTHER? MAYBE THE ONE THAT GOT AWAY? She's beautiful. Decorating a Christmas tree. HMM. SPICY. I THOUGHT THAT YOUR GRANDPA WAS A WRITER, THOUGH? WRITER, PAINTER, PHOTOGRAPHER. HE WAS A RENAISSANCE MAN. MM. I LOVE A RENAISSANCE MAN. AND HE WAS WORKING ON SOME STORY. I'M NOT SURE HE EVER FINISHED IT. THERE'S SOME PIECES MISSING. I'M TRYING TO FIND OUT EXACTLY WHAT WENT ON THERE. LOVE, ROMANCE, MYSTERY, CHRISTMAS. SOMETHING IN MY GUT TELLS ME IT'S SPECIAL. I DON'T KNOW. IT'S... NO, NO, NO, NO. YOU DO KNOW. THIS IS YOUR STORY, AND IT'S CALLING YOU. YES, YOU COULD SAY THAT. I WANT YOU TO SAY IT. YES, IT'S CALLING ME. THEN GO TO PINEVILLE AND FIND THAT STORY AND BRING IT BACK TO ME. OKAY, I WILL. THANK YOU, VIVIAN. YOU'RE WELCOME. TALK TO YOU SOON. ♪ YOU'RE ON YOUR WAY ♪ OH, I'M SO PROUD OF YOU, LITTLE GIRL.

SOMEONE SAID RECORDS HAD TO BE SEARCHED IN PERSON. THAT'S RIGHT. I MIGHT BE ABLE TO HELP YOU OUT. WHO ARE YOU LOOKING FOR? WOULD YOU HAPPEN TO KNOW A MARY? - WELL, THAT'S MY NAME. - REALLY? AND THEN THERE'S MARY WHITE AND MARY BOYD. MARY RUTH LYNN. OH, AND MARY CORNWELL. A LOT OF MARYS HERE. MM-HMM. YOU WOULDN'T HAPPEN TO KNOW THIS MARY? MARY PAYTON. YOU DO KNOW HER? I KNEW HER. SHE JOINED HER BELOVED RICHARD FIRST OF THE YEAR. HE PASSED AWAY A FEW YEARS AGO. GOSH, THOSE TWO WERE INSEPARABLE. SUCH A LOVE STORY. DID YOU KNOW HER? SHE KNEW MY GRANDPA. I THINK, UM, HE PASSED THROUGH HERE A LONG TIME AGO. WELL, I'VE BEEN HERE 10 YEARS, BUT MARY AND RICHARD WERE ALREADY LIKE AN INSTITUTION AROUND HERE, ALWAYS HOLDING HANDS. WOULD I BE ABLE TO CHECK YOUR OLD LOCAL NEWSPAPERS? OR IN OUR CASE, PAPER. THE ONLY LOCAL PAPER ANYMORE IS THE "PINEVILLE PRESS." OH. HAS THAT ALWAYS BEEN THE CASE? NOT ALWAYS. YOU KNOW, A LONG TIME AGO, PINEVILLE HAD AS MANY AS FOUR NEWSPAPERS. CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT? BUT "PINEVILLE HERALD TIMES" SHUT DOWN IN 2010. OH. OR WAS IT 2012? THAT'S... ACTUALLY I WAS HOPING TO CHECK YOUR OLDER PAPERS. OH, WELL, WE HAVE A COUPLE OF HARD COPIES. ALL THE OTHER ARCHIVES ARE ON MICROFICHE AND THE COMPUTER, OF COURSE. THAT'S GREAT. SO YOU SAID YOUR GRANDFATHER LIVED IN PINEVILLE? NO, HE WAS HERE WORKING ON A STORY... I THINK. HE WAS A REPORTER FOR THE "EAST BAY TIMES" FOR FOREVER. DID YOU LOOK THROUGH THEIR ARCHIVES? WHAT I COULD BEFORE I LEFT. YOU KNOW, I TRIED GOOGLE, AND I COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING. AND THEN WHEN I CALLED THE PAPER, THEY SAID THAT A FIRE IN THE '70s HAD PRETTY MUCH WIPED OUT EVERYTHING BEFORE THAT. OH. WHAT'S WRONG? PINEVILLE ACTUALLY DIDN'T GET THEIR LOCAL PAPER UNTIL 1958. OH, THAT'S FINE. BUT THE OLDEST ARCHIVES WE HAVE ARE ONLY 25 YEARS OLD. YOUR OLDEST ARCHIVES ARE FROM 1995? THAT'S LAST CENTURY. WE DO HAVE A FEW PIECES THAT ARE OLDER, BUT NOTHING SUBSTANTIAL. JUST BIG EVENTS, MAN ON THE MOON, THAT KIND OF THING. I'M SORRY. THAT'S OKAY. I MEAN, YOU DO HAVE A PRETTY NEAT TOWN HERE. THAT WE DO. DOES MARY HAVE ANY FAMILY LEFT IN TOWN? OH, YES, MARY'S CAFE. THAT'S ONE OF THE OLDEST BUSINESSES IN TOWN. HER FAMILY RUNS IT NOW. THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO HELP YOU. THANK YOU. - GOOD LUCK. - THANKS. HO, HO, HO. HEY, HEY, HEY. UH... I MEAN... I'M SORRY. WE'RE A LITTLE BIT SHORT-STAFFED RIGHT NOW. I'M GETTING READY FOR THE BOOK EXCHANGE. HOW CAN I HELP YOU? COFFEE? NO, NO, THANK YOU. UM... MY NAME IS LENA JONES. I WAS LOOKING FOR SOME INFORMATION ABOUT A MARY PAYTON. THAT'S MY GRANDMOTHER. SHE PASSED AWAY EARLIER THIS YEAR. YES, I HEARD. I'M SORRY. I'M MICHAEL. MICHAEL PAYTON. VERY NICE TO MEET YOU. MY GRANDFATHER PASSED AWAY EARLIER THIS YEAR, TOO. OH. WELL, I WAS GOING THROUGH SOME OF THESE THINGS AND, YOU SEE, I THINK OUR GRANDPARENTS MIGHT HAVE KNOWN EACH OTHER. HOLD ON TO THAT THOUGHT. I THINK MY COOKIES ARE ON FIRE. YOU CAN SAY THAT AGAIN. FOCUS, LENA, FOCUS. NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO. OH, MAN. ELLA. OH, YEAH. THAT'S MY FAVORITE CHRISTMAS ALBUM. I HAVE THE SAME ALBUM. YOU HAVE GOOD TASTE. BUT DON'T TASTE THESE. OH, NO, I'M SORRY. NO, DON'T BE SORRY. IT'S OUR FIRST BOOK EXCHANGE WITHOUT GRANDMA. WE ALL BEEN A LITTLE SCATTERED. LAST TIME, THE SPRINKLERS WENT OFF. YEAH. SOMEHOW GRANDMA DIDN'T MANAGE TO PASS ON HER BAKING INTO THE NEXT GENERATION. YEAH. MY DAD'S THE ONE THAT SET OFF THE SPRINKLERS. AND AS YOU CAN SEE, IT DIDN'T SKIP AND LAND ON ME EITHER. SORRY, YOU DON'T NEED TO HIT US. NO, I DO ACTUALLY. THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I WANT TO HEAR. I'M WRITING A STORY. A STORY ABOUT MY GRANDMA? I WORK AT VIBRANT MAGAZINE. OH, VIBRANT. I'VE BEEN READING THAT FOR A LONG TIME. BIG FAN. THANK YOU. LOOK, I WOULD LOVE TO TALK TO YOU, BUT I DO HAVE TO GET BACK AND CLEAN UP AND MAKE ANOTHER BATCH OF COOKIES IN A HURRY. MAYBE YOU COULD COME BACK LATER. WHERE DID YOU GET THIS? THAT'S MY GRANDPA STANDING NEXT TO HER. WOW. THEY LOOK LIKE A COUPLE. YOU KNOW, I COULD HELP YOU MAKE A NEW BATCH OF COOKIES, AND YOU COULD TELL ME A LITTLE MORE ABOUT YOUR GRANDMOTHER. YOU COULD? YEAH, LET ME GO MAKE A QUICK PHONE CALL WHILE I GRAB THE PAINTING. THE PAINTING? OF YOUR GRANDMOTHER. WAIT, YOU HAVE A PAINTING OF MY GRANDMOTHER, TOO? HI, MOM. CAN YOU TEXT ME YOUR CHRISTMAS COOKIE RECIPE? Which one? Little soldier boy? THE CHOCOLATE GONNA KNOCK YOU OUT, OR MY SWEET DREAMS OF CHRISTMAS? THE GINGERBREAD. AH, SUGAR AND SPICE AND, OH, SO NICE. OH, WAIT A MINUTE. YOU'RE MAKING COOKIES? I thought you had a story you were working on. MICHAEL HAD A LITTLE ACCIDENT. MICHAEL? WHO'S MICHAEL? IT'S NOTHING. HE'S MARY'S GRANDSON. MM-HMM. MOM, IT'S NOT A MM-HMM. HE'S CUTE. I CAN HEAR IT IN YOUR VOICE. OH, HE'S GORGEOUS. I MEAN, MOM, I'M WORKING ON A STORY, OKAY? YEAH. WHAT DID HE SAY ABOUT DAD? WE JUST MET. I'M GONNA ASK HIM. OKAY, I'M GONNA TEXT YOU THE RECIPE. Good luck. THANKS, MOM. AH. DEFINITELY MY GRANDMOTHER. SHE'S BEAUTIFUL, MICHAEL. THE BOOK EXCHANGE WAS SOMETHING SHE STARTED WAY BACK. SHE WAS A TEACHER, TOO. COMMUNITY AND LEARNING, THAT'S WHAT SHE WAS ALL ABOUT. AND WE WANTED TO KEEP THE SAME TRADITION. AND THAT'S WHY I'M DRESSED LIKE THIS, BY THE WAY. I THOUGHT YOU WERE JUST GOING FOR A NEW LOOK OR SOMETHING. I'M SANTA A COUPLE TIMES A YEAR. REALLY? IT'S A PERK OF THE JOB. HEY, IF THERE'S ANYTHING YOU WANT FOR CHRISTMAS, LET ME KNOW. WOW. THEY REALLY REMIND ME OF GRANDMA. YOU KNOW, WHEN I WAS LITTLE, I USED TO HELP HER BAKE. YOU DIDN'T LEARN ANYTHING WHEN YOU WERE HELPING HER OUT? I WAS 5 AND MAINLY LICKING A BOWL AND SPOONS. CHRISTMAS WAS HER FAVORITE, AND THE FAMILY LOVED HER COOKIES. SO DID THE TOWN. SHE SOUNDS LIKE MY MOM. I CAN'T LIE. THIS IS HER CHRISTMAS COOKIE RECIPE. MM. SHE'S LIKE THE QUEEN OF CHRISTMAS. EVERY YEAR, COOKIES, CAKES, PIES, BIG CHRISTMAS PARTY, THE WORKS. WHAT IS IT? IT'S JUST THAT, UH, DO YOU REALLY THINK THERE'S MORE TO OUR GRANDPARENTS' RELATIONSHIP THAN JUST FRIENDSHIP? I DON'T KNOW. IT'S... IT'S HARD TO EXPLAIN. I... YOU KNOW, I WENT THROUGH THE ATTIC AND WENT THROUGH SOME OF HIS THINGS, AND THERE WERE UNFINISHED PAINTINGS AND STORIES AND FRAGMENTS OF IDEAS. AND MARY WAS SOME BIT OF THAT, BUT... SEEING ALL THAT STUFF, IT OPENED UP A LOT OF MEMORIES FOR ME, BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW IT ALL FITS. AND YOU THINK GETTING TO KNOW MY GRANDMA COULD HELP YOU PUT SOME OF THE PIECES TOGETHER. MAYBE. A LOT OF MY GRANDMA'S STUFF IS IN HER OLD ROOM. I MOVED IN A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO, BUT I HAVEN'T BEEN READY TO GO THROUGH ANY OF HER STUFF YET. ARE YOU SURE SHE NEVER MENTIONED A CLARENCE COBB? I MEAN, I'LL ASK MY DAD, BUT THAT'S HIS MOM. HOW LONG YOU IN TOWN FOR? JUST A FEW DAYS. MAYBE YOU COULD COME BY TOMORROW FOR LUNCH. - DAD WILL BE HERE. - THAT'D BE GREAT. I'LL GO THROUGH SOME OF HER STUFF TONIGHT. I'LL LET YOU KNOW IF I CAN FIND ANYTHING. OH, NO, YOU DON'T... I JUST MEAN, I DON'T WANT YOU TO DO ANYTHING YOU'RE NOT READY FOR. IT TOOK ME A WHILE, TOO. TALKING TO YOU REALLY GOT ME THINKING ABOUT HER. I WANT TO. HOPEFULLY I'LL HAVE SOME NEWS FOR YOU TOMORROW. HEY, BEFORE YOU GO, DO YOU MIND IF I TAKE A PHOTO OF THE PAINTING? I COULD SEND IT TO MY DAD NOW. NO, NOT AT ALL. PLEASE. OH, COOL. NICE. WOW. YEAH, THAT'S MOM, ALRIGHT. YEAH. I BET YOU THE REAL THING'S INCREDIBLE. YEAH. IT'S JUST AMAZING THAT THIS WOMAN WOULD HAVE A PAINTING OF MOM. I TOLD LENA THAT YOU'LL BE HAPPY TO SPEAK WITH HER ABOUT IT. LENA, HUH? BEAUTIFUL. LENA'S BEAUTIFUL? THE PAINTING, DAD. I'M TALKING ABOUT THE PAINTING. SO WHERE IS THIS LENA FROM? SHE FROM NEW YORK? NO. WHY YOU SAY THAT? WELL, BECAUSE WHEN YOU SAID HER NAME JUST NOW, YOU LIT UP THE SAME WAY YOU DO WHEN YOU SAY "NEW YORK." SHE'S CUTE. WELL, YOU KNOW. YEAH, I KNOW. YOU TO KEEP YOUR HEAD ON STRAIGHT, THOUGH. YEAH. I CAN'T BELIEVE NEW YORK IS FINALLY HAPPENING. HMM. NEW YORK, NEW YORK. I REMEMBER HOW EXCITED YOU WERE WHEN THAT ACCEPTANCE LETTER CAME IN FROM COLUMBIA. I WANTED NOTHING MORE THAN TO BE ABLE TO SEND YOU THERE BACK THEN, BUT, YOU KNOW... IT ALL WORKED OUT, DAD. AND IF THIS JOB TURNS OUT AS GOOD AS I THINK IT WILL BE, MAYBE YOUR GRANDKIDS WILL BE COLUMBIA GRADS. YOU TALKING ABOUT MY WHAT NOW, GRANDKIDS? SOMETHING YOU WANT TO TELL ME, SON? YOU SURE? NO, NO, NO. ONE THING AT A TIME. ALRIGHT. PRIORITIES. YES, AND NEW YORK IS AT THE TOP OF THE LIST. BOYS, TIME FOR DINNER. "MARY, I JUST WANTED TO WRITE YOU A NOTE" AND THANK YOU FOR THE WONDERFUL PICNIC ON SUNDAY. EVERY DAY WITH YOU HAS BEEN A TREASURE. TIME SEEMS TO STAND STILL AND AT THE SAME TIME MOVE TOO FAST WHEN WE'RE TOGETHER. I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING YOU AGAIN. "ALWAYS, CLARENCE." AND WHO WERE YOU EXACTLY, CLARENCE? MICHAEL SEEMS LIKE SUCH A NICE GUY. THE FAMILY'S A LOT LIKE OURS. SHOULD I SET ANOTHER PLACE AT THE TABLE FOR CHRISTMAS? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? YOU'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT MICHAEL, WHAT, FOR THE PAST 10 MINUTES? THAT DOESN'T MEAN I WANT YOU TO START PLANNING OUR WEDDING. HE SOUNDS WONDERFUL. MOM. He really likes Ella Fitzgerald? MOM, I'M WORKING. OKAY? Okay, okay, but I think you can multitask AND FORGIVE ME IF I'D RATHER TALK ABOUT YOU AND A NEW GUY THAN MY FATHER AND A NEW WOMAN. I'M SORRY, MOM. OH, WELL, IT'LL BE WHAT IT'LL BE, RIGHT? THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE THERE TO FIND OUT. I'M TALKING TO MARY'S SON TOMORROW. MM. ARE YOU STILL THERE? YEAH, IT'S JUST... IF I DO FIND OUT THAT GRANDPA HAD SOME OTHER LIFE or some kind of affair or something, do you really want to know? WELL, YOUR GRANDPA MAY HAVE, AT ONE TIME, BEEN IN LOVE WITH THIS MARY, but I have to believe that my mom was his one true love, his one. I've got to believe. I got to believe that my father, WHATEVER THIS WAS, IT WASN'T SOMETHING UGLY. IT WAS BEAUTIFUL BECAUSE MY FATHER WAS BEAUTIFUL. HE REALLY WAS, WASN'T HE? LENA, BABY, I KNOW YOU'RE WORKING, BUT MAYBE WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR IS RIGHT THERE, RIGHT THERE IN PINEVILLE AND LIKES ELLA FITZGERALD. DAD, LENA DOES SEEM WELL-INTENTIONED. AND HOPEFULLY SHE IS. I JUST THINK WE SHOULD HOLD OFF ON MENTIONING THESE LETTERS TO HER JUST YET. THAT'S HER GRANDFATHER. YEAH, BUT THEY'RE LETTERS TO MY MOTHER. I DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF PRIVATE SECRETS ARE IN THESE THINGS YET. LOOK, YOU HAVEN'T READ ANY OF THIS, HAVE YOU? NO, NOT YET. I FELT A LITTLE... GOOD. WHERE'D YOU SAY YOU FOUND THIS ANYWAY? I FOUND IT IN HER OLD TRUNK WITH THE REST OF HER STUFF. YOU DO UNDERSTAND WHERE I'M COMING FROM, RIGHT? I JUST THINK I SHOULD HAVE A CHANCE TO LOOK THROUGH ALL THESE MYSELF FIRST. MM-HMM. I'D LIKE TO AT LEAST HAVE A CHAT WITH LENA BEFORE WE SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THEM, THAT'S ALL. MICHAEL, THIS GIRL... IS SHE NICE? KATHY. ALLEN. I'VE GOT NOTHING. ZERO, ZIP. HI. SO HOW'S IT GOING? GREAT. SEND ME SOMETHING. Oh, God, no. I MEAN, IT'S REALLY ROUGH RIGHT NOW. YOU DID INTERVIEWS, RIGHT? JUST THE GRANDSON, REALLY. GRANDSON. SO HOW'S THE LOVE ANGLE? UH, WELL, VIVIAN, HE SEEMS REALLY NICE, But trying to be professional. ARE YOU REALLY? I WAS TALKING ABOUT THE LOVE ANGLE BETWEEN YOUR GRANDFATHER AND HIS GRANDMOTHER, BUT NOW THAT YOU BRING IT UP... I'M CONDUCTING INTERVIEWS WITH THE REST OF THE FAMILY TODAY. IN FACT, I SHOULD PROBABLY BE GOING. OKAY, KEEP ME POSTED. I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING WHAT YOU GOT. ME TOO. TONI MORRISON. ONE OF MY FAVORITES. MINE TOO. MOM, DAD, THIS IS THE WOMAN I WAS TELLING YOU ABOUT, LENA JONES. LENA, WE'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT YOU. I'M ALLEN. THIS IS MY WIFE, KATHY. WHAT A LOVELY SWEATER. THANK YOU. MICHAEL TELLS ME YOU WRITE FOR VIBRANT MAGAZINE. IT'S NOT OFFICIAL YET, BUT I'M HOPING THIS STORY WILL CHANGE THAT. THIS IS A STORY ABOUT MY MOM AND YOUR GRANDFATHER? YES. DID YOUR MOTHER EVER HAPPEN TO MENTION A CLARENCE COBB? WHY DON'T WE TAKE A LITTLE WALK? OKAY. BYE. SEE YA. SO YOU'RE FROM THE BAY AREA? OAKLAND. MY WHOLE LIFE. YEAH, MY WIFE, KATHY, IS FROM OAKLAND, TOO. OH, YEAH? WHAT PART? SHE GREW UP IN MONTCLAIR. - I'M FROM MONTCLAIR. - REALLY? YEAH. HOW LONG HAVE YOU TWO BEEN TOGETHER? WOW. ALMOST 35 YEARS. WOW. WERE YOUR PARENTS TOGETHER FOREVER, TOO? SURE SEEMS LIKE IT, BUT... YOU KNOW, LENA, EVERY RELATIONSHIP HAS ITS TRIALS. YEAH. AND... WOW. THIS IS ACTUALLY REALLY HARD TO TALK ABOUT. UM... MICHAEL DOESN'T KNOW ANY OF THIS, BUT THERE WAS A ROUGH PATCH THERE BEFORE HE WAS BORN. MOM AND DAD, THEY WERE GOING THROUGH SOME THINGS. I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS ANYTHING SERIOUS. I CERTAINLY DIDN'T THINK MY MOTHER HAD AN AFFAIR OR ANYTHING. BUT NOW ALL OF THIS COMING UP WITH YOUR GRANDFATHER MAKES ME WONDER IF MAYBE THERE WAS SOMETHING TO THOSE ARGUMENTS THEY HAD BACK THEN. AND TO BE HONEST, I DON'T KNOW IF YOUR GRANDFATHER HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH THAT OR NOT. MY MOM SEEMS TO BE WORRIED ABOUT THE SAME THING. MAYBE I AM, TOO. I ALWAYS THOUGHT MY GRANDPARENTS WERE SOUL MATES. MICHAEL SAID THE SAME ABOUT YOUR PARENTS. GROWING UP, DID YOUR MOM EVER MENTION ANYTHING ABOUT A CRIME STORY OR REPORTER? NO, BUT YOUR GRANDFATHER WAS A CRIME REPORTER, I ASSUME? WRITER, BUT IT SEEMS HE WAS WORKING ON A STORY HERE. WELL, MICHAEL FOUND SOME LETTERS. HE DID? FROM MY GRANDPA? THAT'S AMAZING. I DON'T KNOW WHAT STORY YOUR GRANDFATHER WAS WORKING ON, BUT TO BE HONEST, I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE WHAT KIND OF STORY YOU'RE WORKING ON. WELL, ME NEITHER, REALLY. I LOVE MY GRANDPA. YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT I KNEW HIM PRETTY WELL. AND THEN I FOUND THAT BEAUTIFUL PAINTING OF YOUR MOTHER, AND IT JUST OPENED A WORLD OF THINGS I NEVER KNEW. I JUST WANT THE STORY BEHIND IT, WHATEVER THAT MAY BE. WELL, THEN I IMAGINE THESE LETTERS WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL TO YOU. BUT IF IT'S ALL THE SAME TO YOU, I'D JUST LIKE TO HAVE THE CHANCE TO LOOK THROUGH THEM MYSELF FIRST. I JUST LIKE TO FIND OUT ON MY OWN IF THERE WAS ANYTHING GOING ON DURING THEIR MARRIAGE RATHER THAN READ ABOUT IT IN A NATIONAL MAGAZINE. UNDERSTAND? OF COURSE. THANK YOU. YOU WOULDN'T HAPPEN TO HAVE THE PAINTING, WOULD YOU? MICHAEL SENT ME A PICTURE, BUT I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THE REAL THING. WOW. IT'S BEAUTIFUL. IT WAS PAINTED HERE. - WHAT? - WHAT? THERE USED TO BE A WALL RIGHT HERE. THEY KNOCKED IT DOWN. I REMEMBER IT LIKE IT WAS YESTERDAY. I'M GONNA GO THROUGH THE REST OF THE LETTERS TONIGHT. LENA AND I HAD A LITTLE CHAT. WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME OVER FOR DINNER TONIGHT? I MEAN, IT'S BEEN A WHILE SINCE I'VE TALKED TO SOMEONE FROM THE BRIGHT SIDE OF THE BAY. THAT SOUNDS GREAT. 7:00? 7:00 IS PERFECT. I THINK I'M GONNA BE A LITTLE LATE. OH, DID SOMEBODY INVITE YOU? STEPHANIE IS RETURNING TONIGHT. I WAS GONNA PICK HER UP FROM THE TRAIN STATION. OH, THAT'S SO NICE. I'LL GET TO MEET YOUR SISTER. SHE'S NOT MY SISTER. SHE'S MY GIRLFRIEND. YOUR WHAT NOW? AND HE LIKES TONI MORRISON? AND HE HAS A GIRLFRIEND. YOU'RE GOING TO DINNER, RIGHT? YEAH, I STILL HAVE A STORY TO WRITE. HOPEFULLY MICHAEL'S DAD WILL AGREE TO LET ME READ THE LETTERS. LETTERS? GRANDPA APPARENTLY WROTE MARY, LIKE, A STACK OF LETTERS. WELL, LOVE LETTERS? I don't know, Mom. THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO FIND OUT. MICHAEL FOUND THEM WHEN HE WAS GOING THROUGH HER STUFF. AND YOU DIDN'T FIND ANY LETTERS UP THERE WHEN YOU WERE LOOKING AROUND? I DIDN'T LOOK THROUGH EVERYTHING. I AM SO GLAD YOU COULD MAKE IT. OH, THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. OF COURSE, HONEY. YES. IS MICHAEL HERE? NOT YET. CAN I HELP YOU IN THE KITCHEN? OH. NO, WE ARE GOOD. THANK YOU. THIS IS SUCH A LOVELY TOWN. YEAH, WELL, IT'S NOT OAKLAND. NO, IT'S NOT. COULD YOU EVER SEE YOURSELF LIVING IN A PLACE LIKE THIS? I DON'T KNOW. YOU KNOW, MY FAMILY'S IN THE CITY. IT'S MY HOME. MM-HMM. I GUESS... NO. RIGHT. OKAY. NO, I... I KNOW I'M YOUNG, AND I HAVE A LOT TO LEARN, BUT I KNOW ONE THING... OAKLAND IS MY HOME. I LOVE IT. I LIKE YOU, LENA. MICHAEL WAS GONNA MOVE TO SAN FRANCISCO, YOU KNOW. OH. MAYBE I'M OVERSTATING. HE HAD A JOB OFFER THERE AFTER COLLEGE. NOW HE'S TALKING ABOUT NEW YORK AGAIN. NEW YORK. WE'LL SEE. HE'S BEEN TALKING ABOUT MOVING TO NEW YORK SINCE HE WAS A LITTLE BOY. BUT SOMETHING ALWAYS CAME UP, TOOK HIM IN ANOTHER DIRECTION, YOU KNOW? MM-HMM. IT'S A DREAM OF HIS. I HOPE HE FINALLY MAKES IT THIS TIME. YEAH. WELCOME HOME, STEPHANIE. HOW WAS YOUR TRIP? UGH. WELL, LET ME TELL YOU, I WAS SITTING NEXT TO THIS MAN WHO'S SNORING... I WAS TELLING MY SISTER THAT IF SHE DIDN'T WANT TO GO 50-50 ON THE TICKETS, THEN WE'D HAVE TO FIGURE SOMETHING ELSE OUT. I MEAN, IF WE'RE ALL GOING ON THIS VACATION TOGETHER... HELLO. HI. HI. EVERYONE'S GOT TO PITCH IN. STEPHANIE, THIS IS THE WRITER I WAS TELLING ABOUT, LENA JONES. HI. I USED TO WRITE FOR THE PAPER IN HIGH SCHOOL. OH. IT'S SO MUCH FUN. THOSE WERE SUCH GOOD DAYS. SO ARE YOU WRITING A STORY ABOUT US? UM... WELL, MICHAEL'S FAMILY TECHNICALLY, BUT MAINLY HIS GRANDMA. HIS GRANDMA LOVED ME SO MUCH. Lord. I MISS HER. ANYHOO, WE WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IF WE'RE GONNA GO TO THE OUTER BANKS AGAIN OR TO MYRTLE BEACH. I HAVEN'T BEEN TO MYRTLE BEACH, EXCEPT... STEPHANIE, THAT IS NICE. IT IS. BUT WE WEREN'T REALLY TALKING ABOUT YOUR VACATION SO MUCH. WE WERE ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT LENA'S GRANDFATHER AND HIS LETTERS. AND WHEN I READ THEM, HE DID OCCASIONALLY KEEP MENTIONING "THE STORY." I CAN ONLY ASSUME THAT'S THE STORY YOU MENTIONED EARLIER, LENA? DO THE LETTERS GO INTO ANY MORE DETAIL? NOT MUCH. YOU SEE, YOUR GRANDFATHER WAS CONVINCED SOME MAN WAS INNOCENT. WAS THIS PERSON IN TOWN? NO, BUT HIS BROTHER WAS. I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY WHY HE STOPPED HERE TO BEGIN WITH. BUT THE MAN HE WAS TRYING TO HELP WAS ACTUALLY IN SAN FRANCISCO, AND THAT'S WHY HE LEFT PINEVILLE SO ABRUPTLY. WAS THERE ANY MENTION OF THE PORTRAIT? I MEAN, WAS IT WHILE THEY WERE MARRIED? NEAR AS I CAN TELL FROM LOOKING AT THE DATES, HE CAME THROUGH TOWN FOLLOWING THIS STORY. MOM WAS DEFINITELY LOOKING FORWARD TO HIM RETURNING AFTER HE FOUND WHATEVER IT WAS HE WAS LOOKING FOR, BUT IT SEEMS HE GOT A JOB WHILE HE WAS AWAY AND HE NEVER CAME BACK. MOM AND DAD GOT MARRIED SHORTLY THEREAFTER. THE LAST CHRISTMAS IN PINEVILLE. YEAH, I DON'T THINK IT WAS CHRISTMASTIME, THOUGH. I THINK HE JUST PAINTED THAT PORTRAIT WHILE HE WAS AWAY AND NEVER SENT IT. THAT'S PROBABLY WHY YOUR FAMILY HAS IT. LOOK, AT THE END OF THE DAY, I'M JUST RELIEVED TO KNOW THERE WAS NOTHING GOING ON DURING MY MOM AND DAD'S MARRIAGE, BUT YOU CAN READ ALL THAT FOR YOURSELF IN THE LETTERS. - IT'S OKAY? - ABSOLUTELY. IF YOU DON'T MIND, I'D LIKE TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE LETTERS, TOO. WE CAN SPLIT THEM UP IF YOU LIKE. SOUNDS GREAT. HMM, WHAT'S FOR DINNER? MM. TRADE TOMORROW? SURE THING. I THANK YOU FOR DINNER AND EVERYTHING. OUR PLEASURE. HEY, MOM. I THINK I MAY HAVE FOUND SOMETHING TO HELP YOUR STORY ALONG. It's coming along great now. I'M READING GRAMPA'S LETTERS. I JUST FOUND MARY'S. WHAT? MM-HMM. THERE ARE, LIKE, ALMOST A DOZEN HERE. MOM, CAN YOU DO ME A FAVOR? SCAN THEM AND SEND THEM TO ME. SURE, SURE, AND YOU DO THE SAME WITH DAD'S. YOU GOT IT. "CLARENCE, I ADMIRE YOUR COURAGE." EVEN THOUGH IT'S ONLY BEEN A FEW WEEKS, I FEEL AS THOUGH I'VE KNOWN YOU FOREVER. I DO HOPE YOU FIND THE TRUTH IN SAN FRANCISCO, "BUT I ALSO HOPE THAT YOU KEEP YOUR PROMISE AND RETURN TO ME." "I'VE BEEN HALFWAY AROUND THE WORLD" AND WHO KNEW THAT I WOULD FIND SOMEONE IN PINEVILLE? ROSA'S BROTHER WAS INDEED THE MISSING CLUE. "AND THANKS TO HIM, HE'LL BE A FREE MAN." "I KEEP THINKING OF THE NIGHT" WE DANCED TOGETHER. "DO YOU REMEMBER THAT SONG?" "A-TISKET, A-TASKET." MARY, MY LOVE, I'M SORRY TO SAY, IT'S GONNA BE A LITTLE LONGER BEFORE I'M ABLE TO RETURN TO PINEVILLE. A GENTLEMAN FROM THE "EAST BAY TIMES" WAS IMPRESSED WITH MY STORY AND HAS APPROACHED ME ABOUT A JOB. "BUT I PROMISE THAT I WILL RETURN." "I'M SO HAPPY THAT YOU'VE KEPT IN TOUCH, CLARENCE." I HAVE BEEN KEEPING AN EYE ON FERGUSON'S LITTLE GIRL, CLAUDIA, THESE PAST FEW DAYS. I MUST BE SPEAKING OF YOU RATHER FONDLY AS SHE KEEPS ASKING WHEN YOU ARE COMING BACK. I KEEP ASKING MYSELF THE SAME THING. "I CAN'T WAIT FOREVER, CLARENCE." FINISHED YOURS? YEAH. JUST NOW. YOU? YEP. READY TO TRADE? SURE THING. WHAT'S THAT? MY MOM. SHE WANTS A PICTURE OF MY SMILING FACE. WELL, I CAN'T SAY I BLAME HER. OH. YOU CAN'T? NO. UM... WHERE'S STEPHANIE THIS MORNING? SHE LEFT EARLY THIS MORNING. SHE DOES A LOT OF DAY TRIPS FOR WORK. YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND TAKE YOUR PHOTO FOR YOUR MOM. I DON'T MIND. YOU DID NOT JUST PHOTOBOMB MY SELFIE. HEY, I COULDN'T HELP MYSELF. MY BAD. YOU CAN RETAKE IT. OH, NO, I'M SAVING THAT FOR POSTERITY. IT'S THE SAME ONE, THE SAME ONE THAT'S IN THE PAINTING. HMM? I MEAN, IT LOOKS LIKE IT FOR SURE, BUT... I DON'T UNDERSTAND. I THINK YOUR GRANDFATHER DID COME BACK. HE WORKED AT THE "EAST BAY TIMES" FOR 50 YEARS. HE GOT THE JOB AND NEVER CAME BACK, LIKE YOUR DAD SAID. THIS IS A SPECIAL ORNAMENT. I MEAN, THERE'S A LOCAL EMPORIUM WHERE YOU COULD PAINT YOUR OWN ORNAMENTS. IT'S BEEN HERE FOREVER. YOU SEE THIS GOLD FRAME AROUND THIS ORNAMENT? I THINK YOUR GRANDFATHER DID COME BACK TO PINEVILLE AND PAINTED HIS PORTRAIT. YEAH, BUT HOW DO YOU KNOW IT WASN'T PAINTED BEFORE HE LEFT? LOOKING AT THE DATES ON THESE LETTERS, OTIS' STORE DIDN'T OPEN UNTIL AFTER YOUR GRANDFATHER WAS SUPPOSED TO BE GONE. OUR FAMILY HAD QUITE A FEW ORNAMENTS JUST LIKE THIS ONE. AND THEY'RE ALL FROM THE SAME SHOP. IS THE SHOP STILL AROUND? YEAH. AND THE GUY WHO RUNS THE SHOP, HE MIGHT... YOU MIGHT REMEMBER YOUR GRANDPA. MICHAEL. OTIS. - HOW ARE YOU? - DOING GOOD. HOW ARE YOU? - GOOD TO SEE YOU. - GOOD TO SEE YOU. HI. YOU'RE NOT STEPHANIE. - YOU CAN SAY THAT AGAIN. - OH. - I'M LENA. - NICE TO MEET YOU. DO YOU GUYS NEED ANY HELP SELECTING AN ORNAMENT TO PAINT? ACTUALLY, WE WANTED TO... I'D LIKE TO PAINT A RUDOLPH ORNAMENT, IF YOU HAVE ONE. YOU WOULDN'T HAPPEN TO HAVE A LITTLE CHRISTMAS BELL. ABSOLUTELY. HMM. SORRY, I GOT SIDETRACKED. JUST SEEING EVERYTHING, I GOT REALLY EXCITED. IT'S OKAY. OTIS SEEMED A LITTLE BUSY NOW ANYWAY. I DON'T MIND WAITING. I LOVE PAINTING. MY GRANDPA AND I USED TO PAINT TOGETHER. IT SHOWS. I AM NOT QUITE AS GOOD AS HE WAS. YOU'RE NOT BAD. THANK YOU. OH, I HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING LIKE THIS IN A LONG TIME. ME NEITHER. STEPHANIE DOESN'T PAINT ORNAMENTS/ OH, SHE DOES. SHE'S PRETTY CRAFTY, BUT... YOU KNOW. YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY IT. I'M BETTER COMPANY. MAYBE. THANK YOU. THAT WAS SO FUN. THANK YOU. MERRY CHRISTMAS. OH, SORRY. I HAD TO TAKE CARE OF A CUSTOMER. SO WHAT DID YOU WANT TO ASK ME ABOUT? AN OLD ORNAMENT. DOES THIS RING A BELL? I FOUND IT WITH SOME OF MY GRANDMA'S STUFF. THIS IS ONE OF MY FIRST ORNAMENTS. YEAH, MY THIRD ONE. WHO ARE YOU? I'M CLARENCE COBB'S GRANDDAUGHTER. DO YOU REMEMBER HIM? REMEMBER HIM? CLARENCE COBB SAVED MY BROTHER'S LIFE. YOU KNOW, MICHAEL, I KNEW YOUR GRANDFATHER A LITTLE BIT BACK IN THE DAY. HE BOUGHT THAT ORNAMENT AND GAVE IT TO YOUR GRANDMOTHER, MARY, WHEN HE ASKED HER TO MARRY HIM. WAIT. MY GRANDPA PROPOSED? NO, NO, NOT YOUR GRANDPA. MICHAEL'S GRANDPA, RICHARD. THEY DID GET MARRIED, YOU KNOW. CLARENCE HAD ALREADY LEFT TOWN. YES, I KNOW. I-I'M CONFUSED. I THOUGHT MY GRANDPA GAVE MARY THE ORNAMENT. ARE YOU SURE? IT'S THE SAME ONE FROM THE PORTRAIT. I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT A PORTRAIT. OH, THAT'S... THAT'S DEFINITELY THE ORNAMENT AND THAT'S DEFINITELY MARY. GOD, SHE SURE WAS A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN. CLARENCE AND MARY DID SPEND A LOT OF TIME TOGETHER BEFORE HE LEFT TOWN. I MEAN, HE WAS SO WORLDLY, SO CHARMING, YOU KNOW? MY GRANDFATHER KNEW HIM? NO, HE WAS STILL SERVING IN THE ARMY. AS A MATTER OF FACT, HE CAME TO TOWN RIGHT AFTER CLARENCE HAD LEFT FOR GOOD. WHY WAS MY GRANDPA IN PINEVILLE IN THE FIRST PLACE? YOUR GRANDFATHER, CLARENCE, WAS WORKING ON A STORY ABOUT MY BROTHER WILSON, WHO HAD GOTTEN INVOLVED IN A VERY SERIOUS CRIME IN SAN FRANCISCO. AND YOUR GRANDFATHER WAS CONVINCED THAT HE WAS TOTALLY INNOCENT, AND HE CAME INTO TOWN BECAUSE HE WANTED TO TALK TO ME ABOUT MY BROTHER. HE WENT OUT AND FOUND A CRITICAL WITNESS TO THE CRIME. HE JUST UP AND LEFT. HE WAS GONE. MICHAEL, YOUR GRANDFATHER CAME TO TOWN, AND HE STARTED SEEING MARY. AND THEN OUT OF THE CLEAR BLUE SKY, YOUR GRANDFATHER, CLARENCE, CALLS ME AND TELLS ME THAT MY BROTHER WILSON IS RELEASED FROM PRISON. - AHH. - YEAH. AFTER THE TRIAL, YOU KNOW, I NEVER SAW HIM AGAIN. MY BROTHER AND I WERE IN EUROPE CELEBRATING UNTIL THE NEW YEAR. CLARENCE NEVER CAME BACK. I THINK THAT MUST HAVE BROKE MARY'S HEART A LITTLE BIT. BUT YOUR GRANDFATHER, RICHARD, MADE SURE THAT BROKEN HEART MENDED, AND THAT'S FOR SURE, BECAUSE THEY WERE TOTALLY INSEPARABLE. SOUNDS LIKE A BIG STORY. NO ONE EVER MENTIONED A CLARENCE. NOR A CLARENCE AND MARY. OH, NO, NO, NO. WE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT CLARENCE OR MARY OUT OF RESPECT TO YOUR GRANDFATHER. WOW. MAYBE HE PAINTED IT AND WAS GONNA SEND IT TO HER FROM OAKLAND. MAYBE. MY GRANDPA WAS A GOOD PAINTER, BUT I CAN'T IMAGINE HIM PAINTING SOMETHING THAT DETAILED FROM MEMORY. - YEAH. - HE HAD TO HAVE BEEN THERE. OR AT LEAST HAD A PHOTO. HMM. BUT OTIS SAID HE NEVER CAME BACK. BUT READING THOSE LETTERS... THEY REALLY SEEM TO CARE ABOUT EACH OTHER. I WONDER WHY SHE DIDN'T GO WITH HIM. IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE MY GRANDMA WITH ANYONE ELSE, BUT IT'S EVEN HARDER TO IMAGINE HER LIVING ANYWHERE ELSE. HOW SO? SHE LOVED THIS TOWN. SHE WASN'T MUCH FOR TRAVELING. DID THAT SKIP A GENERATION AND LAND ON YOU? NO, LIKE THE BAKING, I HAD MY FILL OF PINEVILLE. IT'S TIME TO MAKE A MOVE. REALLY? YEAH. YOUR MOM MENTIONED SOMETHING ABOUT NEW YORK. STEPH GOT A JOB OFFER THERE. WHAT'S SHE DO? SHE'S IN PHARMACEUTICAL SALES. SHE'S DOING PRETTY WELL FOR HERSELF. SHE GOT THIS JOB OFFER THAT SHE CAN'T PASS UP. I VISITED NEW YORK IN HIGH SCHOOL ON A CLASS TRIP, AND I FELL IN LOVE WITH IT. I WAS GONNA THERE FOR COLLEGE, BUT WE COULDN'T AFFORD IT. SAN FRANCISCO IS NICE, TOO. YOUR MOM MENTIONED YOU HAD A JOB OFFER THERE? MOM THINKS THAT. I ALMOST HAD A JOB. THERE WAS THIS RECRUITER. BIG FINANCE COMPANY. I STUDIED FINANCE IN COLLEGE, TOO. YEAH, BUT... WHAT? I KNOW THIS MAY SOUND SILLY, BUT I DIDN'T KNOW ANYONE THERE AT THE TIME. GRANDMA AND GRANDPA WAS STILL AROUND THEN. GRANDPA GOT SICK, SO THEY NEEDED MY HELP. I FELT LIKE I CAN WAIT. PINEVILLE, THAT'S FAMILIAR. A LOT OF FRIENDS STILL IN TOWN? A LOT SINCE MOVED TO SAN FRANCISCO AND OAKLAND. OH, YEAH? YEAH. FRIENDS IN OAKLAND, HUH? A FEW. WELL, NOW YOU HAVE ONE MORE. HMM. - MICHAEL. - HEY, THERE. I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR KEEPING THE BOOK EXCHANGE GOING. YOUR GRANDMA WOULD BE SO PROUD. YEAH. AND THIS YEAR'S COOKIES WERE DELICIOUS. THEY WERE ALMOST AS GOOD AS HERS. - DID YOU BAKE THEM? - AS A MATTER OF FACT, IT WAS THIS YOUNG LADY RIGHT HERE. HI. LENA JONES MEET CLAUDIA FERGUSON. MY GRANDMA USED TO TAKE CARE OF HER WHEN SHE WAS A LITTLE GIRL. AND WHEN SHE GOT OLDER, SHE STARTED HELPING OUT WITH MY GRANDMA. CLAUDIA. SHE WAS IN THE LETTERS. WHAT? YOU KEPT ASKING WHEN MY GRANDPA WAS GONNA COME BACK. I ONLY READ IT IN THE LETTERS, BUT I JUST KEPT IMAGINING THIS LITTLE GIRL SO DISAPPOINTED THAT MY GRANDPA NEVER CAME BACK. YOUR CLARENCE'S GRANDDAUGHTER? YEAH. BUT HE DID COME BACK. CLARENCE. GRANDPA. I REMEMBER WHEN HE SHOWED ME THOSE INITIALS. I WAS JUST TICKLED PINK. THINKING ABOUT IT, THEY PROBABLY HAD TO DO IT THE FIRST TIME HE CAME OUT TO VISIT. I REMEMBER YOUR GRANDMOTHER BEING SO EXCITED WHEN SHE WENT TO THE TRAIN STATION TO PICK HIM UP. SHE WAS WATCHING ME THAT DAY, SO SHE TOOK ME WITH HER WHEN SHE GOT HER HAIR DONE. SHE GOT A NEW DRESS. SHE SEEMED SO GROWN UP. YOUR GRANDMOTHER WAS ACTUALLY REALLY PLAYFUL WITH ME, KIND OF LIKE A BIG KID. SHE WAS MY KINDERGARTEN TEACHER, YOU KNOW. HMM. AND I REMEMBER THINKING THAT YOUR GRANDFATHER WAS JUST SO HANDSOME AND TALL. YEAH, WE SPENT THE DAY TOGETHER. I REMEMBER ASKING THEM, "YOU GONNA GET MARRIED?" YOUR GRANDMAMA, SHE HUSHED ME. THAT'S THE FIRST TIME I'VE EVER SEEN HER EMBARRASSED. COME TO THINK ABOUT IT, IT'S PROBABLY WHY I REMEMBER IT. IT WAS A PARTY IN THE TOWN SQUARE. IT WAS CHRISTMASTIME. WHAT IS IT? EVERYONE SEEMED SO HAPPY TO SEE CLARENCE AGAIN. YEAH. EXCEPT YOUR GRANDFATHER, MICHAEL. SEEMS THEY GOT IN A LITTLE BIT OF A DUST-UP. CLARENCE AND YOUR GRANDFATHER. WHAT HAPPENED? I HAD TO GO HOME, BUT DON'T GET THE WRONG IDEA. YOUR GRANDFATHER WAS A VERY NICE MAN. YEAH. AND YOUR GRANDMOTHER WAS JUST BEAUTIFUL. NO WONDER SHE HAD ALL THE BOYS FIGHTING FOR HER AFFECTION. YEAH. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE IN TOWN WHO WOULD HAVE KNOWN THEM AT THAT TIME? GABE SMITH SPENT A LOT OF TIME WITH YOUR GRANDFATHER FROM WHAT I REMEMBER. OH, GABE SMITH. GABE SMITH? YEAH, WHEN HE WASN'T WITH MARY, HE WAS WITH HIM. I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHY. I JUST REMEMBER THEM SPENDING A LOT OF TIME TOGETHER. - IS HE STILL IN TOWN? - GABE SMITH. YEAH, HE HAS A CHRISTMAS-TREE LOT. THIS IS HIS BUSIEST TIME OF THE YEAR. WHICH REMINDS ME, I STILL HAVE TO GET A TREE FOR THE CAFE TONIGHT. WELL, LET'S GO GET A CHRISTMAS TREE. LET'S GO GET A CHRISTMAS TREE. DO YOU SEE HIM? NO, HE'S AROUND HERE SOMEWHERE. HE KNOWS ME. HE'LL FIND US. I FEEL LIKE A BIG KID AT CHRISTMAS. THIS IS SO EXCITING. YEAH. ARE YOU OKAY? YEAH, YEAH, IT'S JUST HEARING ALL THE STORIES AND READING ALL THE LETTERS, IT SOUNDS LIKE YOUR GRANDPA WAS CRAZY ABOUT MY GRANDMA. OH, I CAN'T BLAME HIM. NOW, I AM GLAD HE WOUND UP WITH MY GRANDMA... OBVIOUSLY. I KNOW THIS SOUNDS SELF-CENTERED, BUT BEFORE THESE PAST FEW DAYS, I JUST NEVER GAVE MUCH THOUGHT TO MY GRANDPARENTS BEING YOUNG. YEAH. IT'S LIKE, YOU KNOW, SEEING THE PICTURES AND HEARING THE STORIES ABOUT ALL THE WILD NIGHTS AND PARTIES, KIND OF LIKE HAVE YOU THINKING, LIKE, WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN. I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE TO HELP. HELP? WITH THE TREE. OH, GRANDMA WOULD NEVER FORGIVE ME IF I FORGOT TO PUT A TREE UP IN THE CAFE. I HAVEN'T PICKED OUT A TREE SINCE I WAS A LITTLE GIRL, SO I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH HELP I'LL BE. YOU SAID YOUR MOTHER WAS THE QUEEN OF CHRISTMAS. OH, SHE IS. AND WHAT THE QUEEN WANTS, THE QUEEN GETS. WELL, HOW ABOUT YOU WOULD LIKE TO BE A QUEEN FOR A DAY. I'D LIKE THAT VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. THIS ONE. UH, YOU SURE? WHAT'S WRONG WITH IT? TALL AND SLENDER. AND IT WOULD BE CALLED THE LEANING TOWER OF PISA. I'LL GIVE YOU A TIP, YOUR HIGHNESS. THE KEY TO PICKING OUT A TREE IS THE NAME THAT COMES TO MIND WHEN YOU SEE IT. MM-HMM. THIS ONE'S PERFECT, MICHAEL. WHAT NAME COMES TO MIND WHEN YOU SEE THIS? ♪ A-TISKET, A-TASKET ♪ ♪ A BIG, BRIGHT CHRISTMAS BASKET ♪ THIS IS THE ONE. MICHAEL. MERRY CHRISTMAS. SOMEBODY SAID YOU'RE LOOKING FOR ME. CLARENCE WAS A DEAR FRIEND. HE USED TO COME OUT HERE AND WRITE, PAINT THE TREES. WE'D STAY UP LATE SOME NIGHTS TALKING. WHAT DID YOU TALK ABOUT? EVERYTHING, LIFE, LOVE, WHAT WE WERE GONNA DO. LOOKING BACK NOW, HECK, I REALLY HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT IT FOR SUCH A LONG TIME. CERTAINLY NOT CLARENCE AND MARY AND THE BREAK-UP. WHAT EXACTLY HAPPENED BETWEEN THEM? HOW DID THEY BREAK UP? WHY DID THEY BREAK UP? CLARENCE WAS GOING BACK TO THE BAY. IT WAS AS SIMPLE AS THAT. HE GOT A JOB. SHE WOULDN'T GO? SHE WAS THINKING ABOUT IT. ALL HE HAD TO DO WAS COME BACK AND GET HER. BUT HE KEPT DELAYING HIS RETURN. BY THE TIME HE CAME BACK TO PINEVILLE THAT CHRISTMAS, YOUR GRANDMOTHER HAD FOUND RICHARD. IT WAS OVER. MARY LOVED CLARENCE. BUT SHE LOVED HIM AS A FRIEND BY THE TIME HE CAME BACK. - AND IT WAS TOO LATE THEN. - YEAH. SHE HAD FALLEN FOR RICHARD. BAD TIMING. WELL, MAYBE. BUT NOTHING WAS GONNA STOP CLARENCE GOING BACK TO THE BAY. MARY WAS NEVER GONNA LEAVE PINEVILLE NOW THAT SHE FOUND RICHARD. THAT SEALED THE DEAL. SO MARY AND CLARENCE, JUST... PASSING SHIPS IN THE NIGHT, HUH? OH, NO, IT WAS MORE THAN THAT. HECK, THAT'S WHY HE PAINTED THAT PAINTING. I STILL REMEMBER WHEN HE GAVE IT TO HER. WAIT. HE GAVE IT TO HER? - SURE. - WOW. IT WAS SKETCHED DURING A PARTY AT THE CAFE WHEN MARY WAS DECORATING THE TREE THE LAST TIME HE WAS IN TOWN. HE CAME BACK OUT HERE TO FINISH IT. GIVING IT ONE LAST TRY, YOU KNOW? TO GIVE IT TO HER BEFORE HE LEFT TOWN, HOPING THAT MAYBE THAT WOULD CONVINCE HER TO COME WITH HIM BACK TO THE BAY. SO CLARENCE GIVES MARY THE PAINTING. SHE TAKES A LOOK AT IT, SAYS, "CLARENCE, I KNOW WHAT I LOOK LIKE." IF YOU DON'T WANT TO FORGET YOU, SEND ME A PAINTING OF YOU SOMEDAY. I LOVE YOU. I ALWAYS WILL. "BUT MY HEART BELONGS TO RICHARD." CLARENCE'S BROKEN HEART LEFT TOWN NOT LONG. THE LAST I HEARD, HE'D RUN INTO HIS OLD HIGH SCHOOL SWEETHEART. GRANDMA. I IMAGINE. LOST TRACK OF HIM NOT LONG AFTER. YEARS GO BY, LOSE TOUCH. LIKE I SAID, WE ALL MOVE ON. AND FROM WHERE I'M SITTING, CLARENCE AND MARY MOVING IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS WAS FOR THE BEST. YOU KNOW, IT DOES FEEL LIKE CLARENCE IS HERE AGAIN WITH US. THANK YOU. HOW MUCH DO WE OWE YOU FOR THE TREE? FOR CLARENCE'S GRANDDAUGHTER? IT'S ON THE HOUSE. MERRY CHRISTMAS. - MERRY CHRISTMAS. - MERRY CHRISTMAS. SHOOT. WHAT'S UP? I HAVE TO HEAD TO THE TRAIN STATION. OH. SO HOW'S YOUR STORY ABOUT US COMING ALONG? ABOUT YOU? DID MICHAEL TELL YOU ABOUT THAT TIME MARY AND I DECORATED THAT CAKE TOGETHER? I DIDN'T GET AROUND TO THAT YET. YOU SHOULD TELL HER. MAYBE AT THE SANTA. WHAT TIME IS IT? SANTA? I DON'T THINK I'M GONNA BE ABLE TO MAKE IT TONIGHT, BABE. IT WAS A LONG TRIP, AND I HAVE TO HEAD OUT AGAIN FIRST THING TOMORROW MORNING. YOU TRAVEL A LOT. REALLY, JUST LATELY. IT'S ESPECIALLY BUSY THIS TIME OF YEAR. BUT AFTER TOMORROW'S TRIP, ONE MORE TRIP OUT OF TOWN, THEN I'M BACK. WOW. AND WE'LL BE MOVING TO NEW YORK AFTER THE FIRST OF THE YEAR. BUT AFTER CHRISTMAS, WE'RE FINALLY OFF ON OUR LONG OVERDUE VACATION. WHERE ARE YOU GUYS GOING? - THE OUTER BANKS. - NOT SURE YET. HEY, ARE YOU SURE YOU CAN'T COME? BABE. I COULD REALLY USE A HAND. I'M BEAT. I DON'T THINK I'LL BE MUCH HELP AND I HAVE TO HEAD OUT AGAIN FIRST THING TOMORROW MORNING. I NEED MY REST. ALRIGHT. YOU MIND GIVING ME A LIFT BACK TO THE CAFE? I WASN'T GONNA BRING THE TREE BACK TO MY HOTEL. THEY ALREADY HAVE ONE. YOU KNOW, IF IT WASN'T FOR YOU, I DON'T THINK I WOULD HAVE FOUND OUT SO MUCH ABOUT MY GRANDPA. THANK YOU. AND THANK YOU. HEARING ALL THESE THINGS IS LIKE MY GRANDMA'S HERE AGAIN.

BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE I AM. YOU KNOW, LENA, I WAS TALKING TO MY MOM ABOUT ALL THE STUFF WE LEARNED ABOUT OUR GRANDPARENTS AND HOW THAT WAS REMINDED ME OF... WHY DID YOU DO THAT? BECAUSE YOU WANTED TO, AND I KNEW YOU WOULDN'T. LOOK, LENA... AM I WRONG? IT'S COMPLICATED. AM I WRONG? LENA... YOU ARE AMAZING. BUT... STEPH AND I...

I CAN'T WAIT TO EAT SEAFOOD. STEPHANIE, I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE A CHAT. WE'RE CHATTING NOW. NO, YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A VACATION THAT I'M NOT INTERESTED IN. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT US. WHAT ABOUT US? STEPHANIE, IT'S BEEN SOMETHING I'VE BEEN WRESTLING WITH FOR A WHILE. MONTHS, REALLY. BUT I WASN'T TRYING TO BREAK UP AROUND CHRISTMAS. WHAT? BREAK UP? ALRIGHT, DO YOU WANT TO DO THIS ON-AGAIN, OFF-AGAIN THING AGAIN? STEPHANIE, IT'S BEST WE DO OFF FOR GOOD. AND, YOU KNOW, YOU WANT TO GO TO THE OUTER BANKS, YOU KNOW? YOU DON'T? NO, I DON'T. BUT THE TICKETS ARE NONREFUNDABLE. WELL, YOU CAN GO WITH A FRIEND. TASHA. I HAVEN'T SEEN HER IN FOREVER, AND WE WERE TALKING ABOUT HAVING A GIRLS' NIGHT. WE CAN HAVE A GIRLS' TRIP. OH, THAT WOULD BE SO MUCH FUN. I'M GONNA GO TELL HER. - MERRY CHRISTMAS. - MERRY CHRISTMAS. WHAT'S HER HURRY? WE JUST BROKE UP. REALLY? I MEAN, OH, ARE YOU OKAY? I'M FINE, MOM. WE'VE BEEN GOING THROUGH THE MOTIONS FOR A WHILE NOW. SO YOU'RE NOT MOVING THE FIRST OF THE YEAR? Y'ALL KNOW I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT NEW YORK FOR A WHILE. JUST BECAUSE STEPHANIE AND I BROKE UP DOESN'T MEAN I SHOULD CHANGE MY PLANS. RIGHT? STEPHANIE'S NOT THE KIND OF GIRL YOU CHANGE YOUR PLANS FOR, SON. BUT I KNOW A WOMAN WHO IS. YOU BETTER LISTEN TO YOUR MAMA. CONGRATULATIONS. OH, I'M PROUD OF YOU, BABY GIRL! I KNEW IT. I KNEW YOU COULD DO IT. I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE YOUR STORY ON THE PAGES OF VIBRANT. OH. OH, OH. ARE YOU OKAY? YEAH. WHAT IS... IS THIS ABOUT MARY'S GRANDSON? HMM? YOU TWO DO LOOK GOOD TOGETHER. WE WERE GOOD TOGETHER. HE'S SO SWEET... AND DECENT AND KIND AND A REALLY GREAT KISSER. A GREAT WHAT NOW? I GUESS, JUST LIKE MARY WAS FOR GRANDPA, IT'S A REALLY WONDERFUL MEMORY. - HEY. - HI. - MERRY CHRISTMAS. - HEY, GIRL. - CONGRATULATIONS. - CONGRATULATIONS. THIS IS MY FIANCé, EARL. THIS IS MY AMAZINGLY TALENTED COUSIN, LENA. - LENA, I LOVE YOUR STORY. - THANK YOU. NOW, MOM TELLS ME YOU'RE ON VIBRANT STAFF WRITING NOW. - THAT'S RIGHT. - YOU EARNED IT, GIRL. THANK YOU, AND I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE ENGAGED. IT WAS LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT. NO, IT TOOK HIM A COUPLE OF MONTHS TO REALIZE IT. YOU GOT TO BE PATIENT WITH US GUYS. SOMETIMES IT TAKES US A WHILE TO COME AROUND. - HEY. - HEY, GIRL. DRINKS LATER? YOU GOT IT. - OKAY. SEE YOU. - ALRIGHT. I THINK I'LL HAVE DRINK NOW. HO, HO, HO, HO, HO! - SANTA! - SANTA! HEY, HEY, HEY. I AM SO GLAD YOU BROUGHT GIFTS. MY FAMILY'S NO JOKE. YOU WEREN'T KIDDING. YOUR COUSINS MEAN BUSINESS. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? I LOVE YOU. WHAT? I LOVE YOU. LOOK, I KNOW WE HAVEN'T KNOWN EACH OTHER THAT LONG, BUT I KNOW IT IN MY SOUL THAT I'M CRAZY ABOUT YOU, LENA. AND WHEREVER YOU ARE IS WHERE I WANT TO BE. MICHAEL, THAT'S ABOUT THE BEST CHRISTMAS GIFT THAT ANYONE'S EVER... AFTER LOOKING THROUGH A FEW MORE LETTERS, I FOUND THAT MY GRANDFATHER AND MARY CORRESPONDED JUST A FEW MORE TIMES, THEN THE LETTERS STOPPED. I WONDER IF THEY EVER SPOKE ON THE PHONE OR SAW EACH OTHER AGAIN. I CAN'T IMAGINE THEM SENDING E-MAILS TO EACH OTHER. BUT THEN AGAIN, BEFORE I STARTED THIS STORY, I COULDN'T IMAGINE EITHER ONE OF THEM IN LOVE WITH ANYONE OTHER THAN THEIR SPOUSES. TONI MORRISON SAID LOVE IS NEVER ANY BETTER THAN THE LOVER. I CAN'T IMAGINE TWO PEOPLE BETTER THAN CLARENCE AND MARY. WHILE THEY MAY NOT HAVE SPENT THEIR ENTIRE LIVES TOGETHER, THEY MADE MEMORIES THAT LASTED BEYOND THEIR LIFETIMES. THE STORY OF THEIR LIVES IS JUST ONE OF THEIR MANY GIFTS TO THEIR FAMILIES. AND PERHAPS THE GREATEST GIFT WAS BRINGING THOSE TWO FAMILIES TOGETHER AND SHOWING THEM THAT LIFE IS TO BE LIVED, LIFE IS TO BE CELEBRATED, AND LIFE IS TO BE LOVED.
