MAN: He'’s coming! Oh. Mr. Bullock is coming! Uh, excuse me, miss. Good morning, Mr. Bullock. Look alive, people! Look alive! The rooster'’s in the henhouse! Yeah? Yeah? Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. What is this? What are you doing? I'’m drinking coffee. No, no, no. There'’s no time. Mr. Bullock is on his way. Places, everyone! Why are these here? Why isn'’t the tree decorated? I thought Lottie was supposed to finish decorating the tree. Oh, my God, no. Mr. Bullock hates incompleteness. This is terrible. He'’s gonna kill us all. He'’s gonna murder me. If I go missing, you tell my family I love them. - Merry Christmas. - Get back to work. Oh! Good morning, Mr. Bullock! Excuse me? I said good morning, Mr. Bullock. I saved this one just for you. Oh. Well, that'’s-- Oh, no! [Shatters] Darn. Okay. Glad we had this moment, sir. ♪ Well, the snow outside keeps a-comin'’ down ♪ ♪ It'’s covering the trees ♪ ♪ Lately seems like every day ♪ ♪ Feels like Christmas Eve ♪ ♪ Oh, ho, ho ♪ ♪ Meet me underneath the mistletoe ♪ ♪ Oh, ho, ho ♪ ♪ Won'’t you spend Christmas here with me? ♪ ♪ Now Frosty'’s got his magic hat ♪ ♪ And Rudolf has his shiny nose ♪ ♪ And I'’ve got you to keep me warm ♪ ♪ While they'’re stuck in the snow ♪ ♪ And I say ho, ho, ho ♪ ♪ Won'’t you spend Christmas here ♪ ♪ Spend Christmas here with me? ♪ WOMAN: At the end of the day, we were able to intercept the new shipment and divert the product to a wholesale liquidator, who purchased all of the units at a windfall price, allowing us to at least recover our initial manufacturing costs. What was the impact on human resources? Sadly, we had to lay off all 150 employees, including the CEO, just prior to their Christmas bonus checks being issued. You canceled their Christmas bonus checks? My investment firm won'’t like that. No. I included the bonus checks into their employee severance package as a gesture of goodwill. The liquidation did, however, provide Bullock & Barnes a substantial savings, which allowed us to recover our initial investment into Flacco and realize a small profit of 2.5 percent. Thank you, Riley. Job well done. Thank you, sir. Others could benefit by your example. Meeting adjourned. Could I have my milkshake, please? Milkshake, yes, sir. What kind? Tan-colored. T-Tan milkshake. Yes, sir. Oh, when you'’re done here, swing by my office, will you? I have something I want to discuss with you. Yes, sir. Of course. Looks like you scored big. Congratulations. Ms. McCormick. Please, just call me Dana. Of course, Dana. Did you need to see me? Well, I just wanted to hang back for a few extra minutes and talk to you. Talk to me about what? Holding firms like Bullock & Barnes tend to only look at the financial side of companies under their control. I know that. I would be lying if I said that I approved of what we just did to the Flacco Company. Laying off 150 people at Christmastime? It'’s not the kind of business I enjoy being in. I know. You did what they asked you to do. I just hope you don'’t start liking it. Thank you, Dana. Well, you don'’t want to keep Mr. Bullock waiting. No, I don'’t. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas, dear. Good luck. Thank you. Hello? Hey, beautiful. How'’d it go? Pretty well, I think. I completed the assignment in record time and saved the company a boatload of money, and we even made a small profit by the time the smoke cleared. Fantastic. How'’d the old man take the news? Good, I think. He asked me to come see him. Ah. Oh, speaking of bosses, mine'’s on the other line. You want to meet at DeLorie'’s after work and fill me in on all the nitty-gritty? Maybe we'’ll have something to celebrate. Either way, I'’m buying the drinks. Love you, sweetheart. You too. Ah, Riley. Come in, sit down. Mr. Bullock, you wanted to see me, sir? Yes, I did. I think after your performance in the conference room, you might know why. Sir, if this is about the Christmas bonus, I can explain. You did great. Handing out those bonus checks was genius. You might be executive material. Executive material? Normally I wouldn'’t say this, but you remind me of me. Wow. What do you know about one of our smaller holdings, a company called OutWear? It'’s a boutique outerwear company, designed one of the most popular hiking jackets of the 1970s. I think my dad had one. I think we all did. Fine jackets too. Did you know my late business partner Brian Barnes was from that same town? No, sir, I didn'’t. That sounds quaint. Yeah, of course it'’s quaint. It'’s Vermont. Barnes was so moved by the company'’s designs that he wanted it to be the first place we invested in. That'’s really nice. Yes, the very definition of small town success. But I never liked Barnes. I want you to shut the company down. What? OutWear has been underselling for the last five years easily, and it'’s time to cut the dead weight. And you'’re handing this to me? Riley, what do you think I'’ve been talking about here? Yes, I'’m handing it to you. You came to the right girl, sir. I will get right down to the file room and start pulling the fiscal reports. That won'’t cut it, Thomas. I think you need to go there. I-I'’m sorry, go there? To Vermont. Mr. Bullock, I'’ve never been north of 78th Street. Well, me neither, so don'’t think of it as an assignment. Think of it as a vacation. Now, if you pull this off, you and me will be just like this, understand? I understand. A complete closeout. Employees, stock, equipment, everything. Everything. Consider it done, sir. By Christmas, Riley. I'’ll get right on it, sir. Oh, and one more thing. Take a heavy coat with you. It'’s pretty chilly up in Vermont this time of year. Great. Bring me another straw! - Hey, Wyatt. - Oh, hey. Is that the new prototype for the skiwear line? Yeah, just picked it up from the factory. - What do you think? - Wow. Good stitching. Nice insulation. Great work, Randy. Thanks, Wyatt. [Phone chiming] OutWear. This is Wyatt. Hi, Wyatt, this is Cyril from Preston Bullock'’s office at Bullock & Barnes. - Oh, hey. - Hi. Mr. Bullock asked me to give you a call and just sort of let you know that we'’re gonna send somebody down there to take a look at the company. Look, Cecil-- It'’s Cyril, actually. My parents were hoping for a girl, and they really wanted to name her Carol, so... Right, um... I know the numbers haven'’t been great. Tell Mr. Bullock that we'’re launching several new products, and I'’m confident that things will turn around by the end of the quarter. Yes, absolutely, and I actually-- I did tell him that already. And what'’d he say? He said to send a consultant as soon as possible. Okay. And when is he arriving? She arrives first thing tomorrow morning. We'’ll... We'’ll be ready. That'’s gonna make Mr. Bullock very happy. Talk to you soon. MR. BULLOCK: Cyril! Yes, sir? My computer'’s not working! Is it turned on, sir? Thank you, Cyril! Anytime, sir. Anytime. Hello. Mom. Mrs. Faust needed a ride to do some errands, so I just thought I'’d stop by. Well, thanks, but it'’s not a very good time. Oh, when is it ever really a good time? You know, you work too hard. Did you have breakfast? You look pale. I had a coffee-- have a coffee. I'’ll get you something. No, that'’s not necessary. How about dinner? I'’ll make chicken-fried steak. - Mom-- - Chicken-fried chicken? I just need to do my job. Everybody around here'’s trying to tell me how to do my job. No offense. Okay, what'’s wrong? This company'’s been around for 50 years. We have a reputation for quality and integrity, and whatever downturn we might be in, I can handle it. All right, well, you promise me one thing. What'’s that? You promise me that you will also take care of you. Yes. Thank you. All right. Mwah! Oh. Dinner tonight, 7:00? Rain check. You work too hard. - Okay. - [Laughing] Ha ha ha ha ha. [Sighs] Oh, boy. - DAVID: Vermont, huh? - RILEY: Yep. Well, so isn'’t that where the cheese comes from? No, I think that'’s Wisconsin. New England produces maple syrup. I don'’t know. But Vermont too. They invented cheddar or something. - Does it matter? - No. I'’m not going there for the cheese. I'’m gonna liquidate a failing company. And if I do a good job, there'’ll be some nice dividends. See, that sounds like fun. I wish I could be there for it. Why do they have to fire everybody right before Christmas? Why can'’t they just wait until after the holiday? Hey, Christmas is just a commercialized holiday designed to separate you from your wallet. You know that. Besides, you didn'’t cause this business to fail. Companies open and close all the time. It'’s just the ying and yang of commerce. Yeah. No, you'’re right. I didn'’t cause the company to fail. I just wish I didn'’t have to go there. Well, if it were me, I would not tell them the bad news until the very last moment, use a cover story to get what I want and then give them the ax when I'’m on my way out the door. Yeah. No, you'’re right. Of course I am. Besides, how bad could it be? Yeah, how bad could it be? ♪ Oh, the countdown'’s on ♪ ♪ Just a few more days till Christmas comes ♪ ♪ Gotta get ready '’cause soon comes Christmas Eve ♪ ♪ Sounds of reindeer from above ♪ ♪ We'’re all inside with folks we love ♪ ♪ Here he comes ♪ ♪ Here comes Santa Claus ♪ I think you'’ll find me more than qualified-- Well, boys. Hey, Nick, how'’s it look? - It'’s looking good. - Thanks. How can one be more than sat-- Talking to yourself, Nick? Oh, it'’s just practicing. - Gotcha. - Let me ask you something. Do you think it'’s possible for someone to be more than qualified for something? Not if you'’re working here. Ho, ho, ho. I think you'’ll find me more than qualified-- Merry Christmas, Mr. Harper! Merry Christmas to you. Slow down! Sorry! Ohh! Ooh. Here, take my hand. Stop those kids! They attacked me! Aw, I think they were just not paying attention - to what they were doing. - Are you kidding me? They took my bag. This one? Well, um, yes. Thank you. - New in town? - What gave it away? Well, most locals don'’t need a map to find their way around. Right. I don'’t suppose you know where OutWear is located? Well, I just might. I was on my way there myself. - You were? - Yeah. Gonna apply for a job. Why would you apply for a job two weeks before Christmas? It'’s the time when people need extra help the most. That'’s a good point. I'’m Riley. Nick. Well, mind if I tag along, Nick? Not as long as you watch your step. That'’s very funny. - We'’re going this way. - Yeah, I got it. - Hey, Nick. - Steve. Hey, good to see you. Hello! Can I help you, miss? Yes, hi. I'’m Riley Thomas. I'’m just in from New York, from Bullock & Barnes. I believe I'’m expected. Oh, Bullock & Barnes. You'’ll be wanting to talk to Wyatt. Let me go get him. Can I get you some coffee? No. This is their corporate office? Yeah. "OutWear. For a better life out there." That'’s not bad. I'’ve grown kind of fond of it myself. You like it? He ought to. He wrote it. Wyatt. Oh, here, I'’ll take her. [Dog whines] Mr. Harper. I don'’t understand. This is Nick Harper, founder of OutWear. Founder? You said you were coming to apply for a job. I am. I haven'’t worked here for years. After I sold the company to your boss, they retired me. Nick, you know things are too slow around here to bring on anybody new. I hardly think of myself as someone new. You know what I mean. As for your boss, I appreciate the fact that he thinks we need help, but we'’re doing just fine. I think this whole trip was just a waste of time. Help? What exactly did Bullock tell you about my coming here? Well, we only chatted briefly, but he said you'’d be coming down to make some adjustments for profit, so I assume that meant helping us end our holiday quarter on a high note. Yes, that is it. Exactly. Well, like I said, we don'’t need the help, so... I'’m glad you feel that way, but the holding company has a controlling interest, so unfortunately you don'’t get to make those decisions. Well, technically, I have operating authority. For now. For now. Okay, why don'’t we discuss this in my office? Upstairs. Fine. Fine! Right this way. Hey, where you going? If there are any major decisions to be made about the company, I'’d like to sit in. Nick, I can handle this. Okay, I'’d like to stick around if that'’s okay with you. Fine, but you can'’t come into the meeting. Okay, as you like. So what do you want me to do? I don'’t know. Talk to Edy. Okay. This way. You like my tinsel? Look, I apologize if I was a little short out there, but I'’m pretty protective of this company, and this season hasn'’t been the kindest. Fair enough. OutWear hasn'’t produced a breakout product in sometime, and for a company that employees almost the entire town, I'’m well aware that we need a little boost. Did you say this place employs the entire town? Yeah, a good number. It is a small town after all. Of course. And what makes you think I'’m not the boost you need? Well, no offense, but I'’ve dealt with you corporate types before, and you people look at places like bugs under a microscope. So what you'’re saying is I lack the ability to see this company for what it really is. In so many words, yeah. Well, as I said before, you don'’t really have a choice. However... - I do agree. - You do? Well, you'’re right. I mean, I don'’t know this place, and if I'’m going to get a proper assessment of what'’s in front of me, I'’m gonna need the assistance of someone who does. But since you don'’t seem to want to help me, I will find someone who can. Okay, um... What? Hold on. Wait a minute. You, Nick, you wanted a job? - Yeah. - You'’re hired. What? You can'’t just hire anybody. Actually, I can. As the appointed representative of Bullock & Barnes, you work for me. What? That'’s right. I'’m the boss now, and I choose to hire him. - That'’s insane! - No, actually it'’s perfect. Who better to teach me the inner workings of OutWear than the founder of the company? Oh, sure, and we'’re gonna pay him with what money? Or did you forget the entire reason that you'’re here is because we'’re in a financial bind? Apprentice? A what? Interesting. An apprentice. An apprentice. - Are you in? - No! - I am in. - Nick, crazy though it may be, welcome to the new OutWear apprenticeship program. - Thank you. When do I start? - Two minutes ago. I need you to gather all the information you can dig up, and I want to know where every body is buried. What just happened? Looks like there'’s a new sheriff in town. But I thought the whole point of this trip was to close the place down, not hire new people. Yeah, I know, but what can it hurt? Besides, Mr. Bullock wants me to look at the saleable assets of OutWear, and I found just the perfect person to help me do that. Even if he doesn'’t realize what he'’s doing? I didn'’t lie to him. I didn'’t lie to anybody. I just left a few things out. I hear you. I would'’ve done the exact same thing. Really? So how'’s the town? Small, cold. The people seem nice enough. There'’s this one guy, oh, he'’s a handful. But his days are numbered, right? Right. That'’s my girl. - Talk soon. - Bye, gorgeous. I know you won'’t be thrilled with me going back to work again, but it did feel awful nice, hanging out around the old offices again. I guess a part of me never really left there. Don'’t figure to put up a tree this Christmas. There'’s nobody to help me decorate it. Never was very good at much of anything without you. Still the same. I love you. Morning, Edy, Katie. - Morning. - Morning. Morning. Steve. Steve, right. - It'’s a pleasure. - Likewise. What is this? That'’s an invitation to OutWear'’s party. Oh! Can you afford to be throwing a party right now with the company doing so poorly? What are you celebrating? We'’re celebrating Christmas. Thank you, Edy, but I don'’t think I'’ll still be around on Christmas Eve. WYATT: Don'’t take off your coat! You'’re not staying. As I told you yesterday, I'’m not going anywhere. You and I have an appointment to go to the prototype floor. Do you want to see the various parts of OutWear? Well... you get what you ask for. I see. I'’d like to wait for Nick to join us, if that'’s all right. I'’m way ahead of you. He'’s already on his way there. The factory'’s about six blocks that way, right past the theater. Can you tell me again why we'’re not driving? Are you kidding me? This fresh air is amazing. Excuse me. - Can I help you? - Oh, yes, thank you. - Thank you so much, Wyatt. - You'’re welcome. You'’re not cold or anything, are you? Of course I'’m cold. But if you'’re trying to get me sick, it'’s not gonna work. I have the constitution of a horse. Well, that explains everything. But seriously, I walk as much as possible. I love being out on the streets of this town. It'’s beautiful. - Wyatt! - Hey, Wendy! Just the person I was looking for. I need someone to try my new flavor. Yeah, sure. Mmm, Wendy... that'’s a winner. Mmm! Okay. That'’s amazing. What is in this? Wouldn'’t you like to know? Everybody gets really excited around Christmas. I think it'’s just too much sugar. Christmas is a commercialized holiday designed to separate you from your wallet. Whoa! What grouch said that? Someone who knows what they'’re talking about. Oh, well, how about we continue on with our pleasant day? Yes, it'’s so pleasant. - Wyatt! - Jim! - How you doing, pal? - I'’m good, Jim. I'’m doing, doing great. How'’s things on the floor? Have you got any new designs? We could really use some new designs. There'’s not much point in having a prototype plant if we don'’t have any prototypes. I do. I'’m working on some pretty important things. We'’ll have some new designs soon. You will? Yeah, sure, kind of. Jim, this is Riley. She'’s from New York. I heard about you. Howdy, ma'’am. Howdy, Jim. Nick here yet? Oh, yeah, he'’s out on the floor. He'’s waiting for you. Of course he is. Right this way. Would you mind getting rid of that for me? Oh, sure, no problem. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. That'’s a winner. - Hey, Wyatt. - Frank. How you doing? Nick! - How you doing? - Frank. You must be the New York gal who'’s come to give us one of those big, fancy city makeovers. I watch your shows on TV with my wife. Riley Thomas. Pleased to meet you. This is Frank. He oversees factory management for OutWear. - Been with us a long time. - Mm-hmm. - Since, uh-- - Well, since him. Well, we were younger then. That'’s for sure. Management comes and goes, but things here on the floor stay the same. Still, it'’s good to have you back, Nick, even if it is as an intern. - Apprentice. - Apprentice? Well, pay attention, son. You just might learn something. [Laughs] I'’m sure you guys don'’t want to sit here talking all day. Let'’s show Riley here the lay of the land. Follow me. After you. Check this out. Thank you so much for what you'’re doing. Yes, thank you! - What was that all about? - Beats me. Oh, very nice! Is there documentation for all of this equipment? Serial numbers, make, model, ID'’s? Yeah, absolutely. Great. These are in excellent condition. Thank you so much for showing me around. - Appreciate it. - No, ma'’am, thank you. Everyone here is very grateful for what you'’re doing. Don'’t mention it, Frank. - Bye. - See ya, Frank. - Nick. - Take care, Frank. You kids want a ride back to the office? - No. - Yes. NICK: Y-You walked here? I don'’t want to talk about it. RILEY: While we were in there, everyone kept thanking me. Why? Well, news travels fast in a small town. What do you mean? Look, it'’s no secret that OutWear has been in a tough place recently. A lot of people have been resigned to the fact that this could be it. That Christmas Eve party you'’ve been hearing about? People were pretty prepared for that to be the last hurrah. What changed? You, my dear. Me? Yeah, you. Like I said, news travels fast. When people heard somebody was coming from New York to help, well, they got pretty excited. I see. I think that we could'’ve pulled it off without you, but, hey, if people get pumped up, so be it. [Intercom buzzes] SECRETARY: Mr. Bullock, Miss Thomas on line one. Put her through. - RILEY: Mr. Bullock. - Thomas! - Did you get my email? - Of course I got your email. Are those numbers accurate? Yes, sir. I just visited the factory and got an itemized list of all the equipment on site. There is a lot of value on the property and a small profit to be made by liquidating the items there. Kaboom! Just what I wanted to hear. Thank you, sir. You take care of business, and we'’ll have you out of there by Christmas. Of course, sir, thank you. Mr. Bullock? Yes, Thomas? What happens to the people? - What people? - The people who work here. What happens to them when we close OutWear down? Thomas, I'’m not the Ghost of Christmas Future. I don'’t know where Tiny Tim will be a year from now. It'’s not our problem. I know, sir. Look, it'’s time to focus on Christmas present, not on Christmas past, got it? Yes, sir, I do. Good. Then we agree. - Yes, sir, we do. - Excellent. Now get back to work. - Thank you, sir. - Remember, Thomas, I gave you this job because you'’re the one person who wouldn'’t dare disappoint me. MR. BULLOCK: Oh, and get me a milkshake! Yes, sir. Whatever you want, sir. Fore! Uhh! [Groans] Be the ball. [Crash] Can I help you? I wanted some coffee, and the cup just flew out of my hand. There'’s so much paperwork to be done. I guess I just got ahead of myself. Accidents happen. You'’re probably just tired. It'’s already been a long morning. I just want to help. Do you really or do you just not want to be home? You are smart. You know what? Why don'’t we get out of here? Let somebody else make the coffee for a change. You'’re the boss. I am. Here we go. Look at them go. Don'’t got a care in the world. Nothing else matters. You ever try skiing? Me? No. It'’s a huge waste of time, like golf. Plus it'’s dangerous. I like to be in complete control of everything that is happening to me. Well, sure you do. Everybody does. But fate does have a way of sticking out its foot and tripping you from time to time. Well, that sounds like you'’re speaking from experience. I know a little bit about it. Tripping? Fate. My wife Miriam. Christmas was a very important time for her. It was the one time of year when we'’d set everything else aside and just celebrate what really mattered in our life. So what changed? She passed away two years ago. Oh. I'’m sorry. I wasn'’t thinking. To see Miriam at Christmas was like looking at a little kid. She was so full of anticipation and excitement. Everything old was new again. She must have really been something. She was. Still, I don'’t know how she'’d feel about you working over Christmas. Miriam believed that if people needed help, and you could lend a hand, you should do it, especially at Christmas. Food for thought, Nick. Kinda. Looks like we'’re the last ones here. Yeah, I guess so, thanks to your idea we play hooky. Well, I really shouldn'’t have done that. So much to do, so little time, but I'’m glad we did. Me too. Oh, that'’s mine. What is this? These are incredible. Did you draw these? Well, I scribbled them. Some of these designs are outstanding. I thought you said you quit? Well, they'’re pretty old, like me. Well, some things stand the test of time. Have you shown these to Wyatt? No, I wouldn'’t waste his time. Nick. Besides, I'’m happily retired. If you were happily retired, you wouldn'’t be standing here right now. You know what I mean. I still think you should show them to Wyatt at some point. Show me what? Oh, nothing, Wyatt. Just some old reports. I thought you'’d gone. I wish. I'’m done now. Good. We were just about to close up. Oh, really? You were about to close up? Then maybe I should ask, "May I be excused?" Or "Do you need anything else from me?" No. You'’re free to go. Whew! Nick? You coming? Sure, Wyatt, sure. Say, Riley, you need a ride? I can'’t believe I'’m saying this, but I think I'’ll walk. Well, let'’s face it, Nick. Ms. Thomas has had enough of us for the day. That'’s not fair. Just because you don'’t like me doesn'’t mean you need to involve my apprentice. It'’s time for you two to just let things cool out, you know? Tell you what, Wyatt. Why don'’t you walk Riley home? Make sure she doesn'’t get lost. - No way! - No, thanks. No arguments! You two get on with it. Where are you staying? The Jefferson Inn. Yeah, I know it. It'’s on my way, so fine. Don'’t bother. Try pretending you'’re human. It might be interesting, hmm? Be nice to each other. He'’s gone. You don'’t actually have to walk me home now. No, let'’s go. RILEY: All right. It'’s a cute little town, I guess. Well, it'’s no New York. That'’s true. Not that I ever get to enjoy it. I'’m always grabbing a cab or meeting a deadline. Still, Christmas in New York. Must be grand. Gosh! That must be tough, stuck here all by yourself without your friends during the holidays. Yeah. I dreaded this trip. Oh, I bet. That'’d make me angry. Why would you say that? I'’m not angry. Oh, no? No! Oh, okay. I'’m sorry. I guess you'’re not angry. So, um, what exactly do you call that face? Okay, you are really pushing my buttons. Now, why would I do something like that? I don'’t know, but I don'’t like it, so stop it. That'’s an order! [Scoffs] That'’s an order? Oh, okay! You know what? How about we just call a truce for the rest of the evening? You stop giving me orders, and I'’ll stop pushing your buttons. How'’s that? Fine. Truce. Truce. You know, at one time, I thought about moving to New York to do what you do. And why didn'’t you? I started weighing things out, started thinking about what it would really be like to leave this place. Yeah, but New York'’s got everything. Skyscrapers that kiss the sky. Watching the ball drop on New Year'’s Eve. Rats the size of dogs. Egos the size of elephants. Opportunity'’s always knocking. Maple trees turning gold in autumn. Neighbors who actually know each other. Smell of fresh pine and campfires. Taste of fresh cider. You know, New York'’s all still there, if you want it. See that'’s where I think you'’re wrong. I think it'’s all still right here. No offense to New York. Oh, please. You don'’t need to worry about insulting me. It'’s not like I'’m gonna move here and ruin your perfect little landscape. Wow. You are tough. Yeah, I am. But I'’m not angry. Well, here we are. Yep, here we are. Thanks for walking me home. I don'’t think anybody'’s done that for me since high school. It was, uh, it was nice. Seeing everything. Well, it'’s not New York. Yeah, you got that right. But, um... What? Oh, nothing. It... It was nice. It'’s no trouble, boss. Don'’t start. I meant that in the nicest possible way. Seriously. What a liar! [Laughs] Anyway, uh, good night. Good night. - [Phone ringing] - Sorry. Oh. Sorry. Can you hold on? Um, thank you so much again. I'’ll see you tomorrow morning. Yeah, sure, bright and early. Okay. Hi. Hey, you. How'’s it going? It'’s good. Long days, paperwork in triplicate, living the midtown life. How'’s Vermont? It'’s, uh... okay. What'’s wrong? You didn'’t get overly anxious and already fire everybody, did you? No, of course not. Things are going pretty much according to Bullock'’s plan. He seems happy. That'’s great. So what'’s the problem? I don'’t know. I'’m just starting to feel like maybe we shouldn'’t be in such a rush here to pull the plug, you know? Maybe this is a mistake. What do you mean? David, this whole community is based around this one company. Shutting it down might kill the entire town. Don'’t let this Christmas nonsense get you all fuzzy. Don'’t make this complicated. I already made things complicated. Any word from Riley yet? No, sir. I keep trying, but there'’s been no answer. Well, try again, and when you finally locate her, don'’t let her get away. Yes, sir. Yes, I will keep trying, absolutely, but I do have to tell you, something just doesn'’t smell right. Well, it'’s Vermont. It'’s probably just the cheese. Yes! The cheese. Good thinking, sir. Hi, Mom. Well, I just got of the phone with Kathleen Fogerty, and she said that she saw you walking through town last night with a very attractive young woman. What? Who? - Oh, uh, Riley. - Riley. Riley, Riley. Do I know a Riley? She'’s the consultant I told you about from the holding company, remember? So when do I get to meet her? She'’s only here for a couple days to help the company, Mom. You know, Kathleen made it sound a lot friendlier than that. Yeah, well Kathleen has been re-gifting the same present since 1982. Good point. But is she cute? I don'’t know. Wyatt! Yeah, okay, maybe she'’s a little cute. Ah, well, bring her over. I'’ll make my pineapple upside-down cake. - Mom. - Pineapple right-side-up cake. I don'’t care. Whatever she wants. It'’s just business. Besides, she'’s-- What? Smart, driven? Frustrating. If she'’s getting under your skin this much, she must be doing something right, just like what'’s her name, the one you met skiing on Ward Hill. Susan. Susan, yes. You said you couldn'’t stand her and two weeks later, she moved in. Yeah, and a week later, she moved out. Ma, I oughta get back to work. All right. I'’ll let you go. - Thank you. - But you could send a picture. - I'’m hanging up now. - Bye. - Yep, I'’m hanging up. Bye. - Picture! EDY: Steve'’s ready for you. Okay, I'’ll be right there! - Morning. - Morning. I have a big task. Up for the challenge? - Try me. - I need sales reports. I want to know exactly where this company sits financially. You got it. - Steve? - Yes. I want to see what you'’ve been working on, along with your ten best and most recent sketches. Sure thing. Edy. Edy, I need all the information we have on OutWear'’s current offerings, costs of good sold, products ranked by profitability, our best markets, demographically speaking. - The works. - Aye-Aye. What'’s going on? We'’re not just gonna save this company. We'’re gonna make it a success. Wow. These designs are boring. Nothing is popping. A jogging cell phone holster? Urban hiking trainers? Why are all of these products being designed for a metropolitan market? The money is in the big cities these days. Where are we with the numbers? This is accurate? Near as I can tell. OutWear needs to make $2 million by the end of the quarter. If we'’re gonna come out ahead? Yeah. Or we close. That'’s the reality. How are we gonna make $2 million by Christmas? We have to launch a new product. Launch a new product? In weeks? No, that'’s impossible. Well, with we currently have, I'’d agree, but we have to come up with something fresh. The first jacket that you designed for OutWear was a groundbreaking success. What changed? That was decades ago. They don'’t make things the same way today. The jacket was rugged. It was built to last a lifetime. And if it got damaged, we'’d fix it for free. It was more than just a jacket. It was my word of honor. Fashion changes, but style doesn'’t. I just feel like we'’re missing something.

The rose, it'’s pretty, huh? A single white rose blossoming in the middle of winter. That bush is over a hundred years old. It produces only one new rose a season. What did Nick say? What'’s old is new again. What'’s old is new again. That'’s it. That'’s what? A rose is a rose is a rose. RILEY: The answer has been in front of us all along. Okay, I'’m listening. Your products have all gone astray. They don'’t represent you anymore. - They don'’t? - No, they don'’t. How do you get people invested in something if you'’re not invested in it yourselves? You have to get back to what works. You don'’t export any old winter jacket. No, no. You don'’t export any old winter boots. You export Vermont. The shine of an apple. The sparkle of the night sky. The amber shade of maple syrup. Every thing that you love about Vermont. That is what OutWear is. What'’s old is new again. I'’m totally intrigued. Come on. We got a lot of planning to do. What exactly are we planning again? A Christmas miracle. Let'’s go! So today I saw something absolutely fascinating. While I was on my walk, I saw a couple, and the girl was enjoying an ice cream cone in the freezing cold, while the boy was drinking hot chocolate. So what does this all mean? Well, it means that people are unique. No two are alike, in spite of what some people would have me believe. And then I saw this single white rose blooming in the middle of winter from a bush that was over a hundred years old. And that'’s when it hit me. We need to stop looking at the future and start looking at the past. You used to export a lifestyle, and now you'’re just spinning wool. So we'’ve gotta turn back the clock. You'’ve lost me. Me too. Okay, it'’s simple. I am proud to introduce the flagship item of OutWear'’s new holiday line, and I found it right here under our noses. - Riley! - Please, Nick. Apprentices will only speak when spoken to. Now, we'’re not gonna reinvent the wheel here. We'’re just gonna roll out the old one. We'’re gonna bust out of here with the very first item ever produced by OutWear fifty years ago. The 50th Anniversary Limited Edition holiday sweater. It'’s the very sweater that launched the OutWear empire. We can even use the same ad. It'’s unique. It'’s collectible. It'’s retro. It'’s Nick'’s. I like it. Me too. It'’s outstanding. I'’d wear it. Well? You sure do remind me of somebody very special. Is that a yes? How can I stop you? I'’m just an apprentice. [Laughter] This is very true. Okay, everybody, let'’s get to work. We'’ve only got a few weeks till Christmas. Let'’s get to work, guys, all right? Okay. [Dog barks] Wow. I'’m impressed. You really mean that? Yeah, I'’m amazed that you took everything in, processed it, and came up with all that. Well, it wasn'’t all me. I mean, Christmas sweaters have been a novelty craze for a while now. I just realized that OutWear could take a step forward by taking a step back. Back to Nick'’s original design and Vermont in a box. A single item built to last a lifetime, one that evokes warm nights by the fire and good friends. Romance. Yeah, but still, I'’m a little embarrassed that I didn'’t come up with it myself. That'’s my job, to figure out how to save this company. Maybe I shouldn'’t be in charge. Don'’t say that. I just saw the rose, that'’s all. Don'’t get me wrong. It'’s a good idea. It really is. Congratulations. We'’re moving the launch up. Yeah, that'’s right. We'’ll need full exposure on all social media sites immediately. Yeah, we'’re gonna want 10,000 likes for starters. That'’ll get us on every social media feed. Oh, and make sure we'’re trending. We have to be trending by 5:00, okay? All right, get back to me with the good word as soon as you can. All right, thanks. Well? We'’ve got all the major social media outlets covered, and it'’s getting massive attention. It'’s moving fast. What about Internet sales? Our business website has been updated, and it'’s moving strong. Pre-sales have been rolling in. Pre-sales? January, February. But what about here and now? Well, we'’re still getting those orders, but since we'’re so late in the Christmas buying season, most of the retailers are thinking long term. Long term? I like that. Well, that'’s great, but we need immediate sales. I just placed a huge order with our off-site manufacturer. We'’re gonna be swimming in sweaters. What about our buyers database? We sent a blast out to all 20,000 buyers. Online wholesalers, boutique outlets. Trust me. It'’s working. I hear you, but is it working fast enough? I think we may need a miracle. Well, it is Christmas. If ever there was a time that miracles happen, this is it. Keep on it. Yes, sir. Hey, it'’s Steve from OutWear. Yeah, I wanted to see if we could get you to take some of these commemorative sweaters. They'’re the hottest thing this season. Christmas sweaters? Are you crazy? It'’s just sweaters to start. I'’m already looking ahead to non-holiday vintage wear. I really think that this is gonna turn OutWear around. I can'’t believe what I'’m hearing. I know, but maybe it'’s the right thing. Trust me, it'’s not. The right thing to do is what Bullock sent you there to do. What'’s he gonna say when he finds out? I don'’t know. I guess I'’ll weather that storm when it arrives. No, Riley, you won'’t. You'’ll get your head cut off along with the rest of them, and then you'’ll all be unemployed. That'’s not the girl I thought you were. I'’m sorry that I'’m not living up to your standards, David. I'’m sure you can find someone who will. Riley, their problems are not your problems. But they will be soon if you don'’t stop this. This is a stupid move. Not smart at all. Stupid? Really? Well, I guess we'’ll see, won'’t we?

I know! [Laughing] These sweaters are amazing. Your idea is working! Only because your team made it work! Get a room, you two. We still have a long way to go. We'’re not out of the woods yet. Still, I think we should celebrate. Dinner? A-Are you asking me out? Uh, dinner with us. With us. NICK: Good idea. [Whispering] Okay. I'’m sorry. What is happening? Oh, he'’s getting the car. We get to drive somewhere? Don'’t get too excited. Get your coat. Okay. It was sheer genius reviving my original design as an anniversary special. I guess I'’d forgotten I founded this company 50 years ago. I think we all had, Nick. We were so busy worrying about the future, we'’d forgotten all about our past. Till Riley came along. Yes, Nick, until Riley came along. Oh, don'’t sound so enthusiastic. I will be leaving soon enough. What'’s in the bag? Oh, this is, uh, this is for you. Really? For your work. You earned it. You guys, this is too much. Looks great on you. You really think so? Yeah. Aw. Look at that. You want to dance? Sure. Nick? Sure. Well, that was an interesting move. Well, I like to keep things interesting. Besides, he hasn'’t always been my biggest fan. Don'’t be too sure. You might be winning him over. I think it'’s gonna take a little more than a good idea to win him over. What would it take to win you over? - I really don'’t know. - Mm-hmm. What about somebody who'’s happy to see you come home at night and sad to see you leave in the morning? I already have a cat. Dang, woman. You remind me of another lady. Nick, I'’m not worthy of that comparison, but thank you. May I cut in? Not a moment too soon. Do you mind? What took you so long? You'’re such a mystery. I just can'’t figure you out. Well, then just dance, cowboy. You really like the sweater? I do. It looks beautiful on you. Yes, it does. I never did get the chance to say thank you. Well, we'’re standing here now, aren'’t we? We keep getting orders. - This is amazing. - We make a good team after all. Yes, we do. If we'’re gonna fill all of these orders, I don'’t think anybody is going home anytime soon. Yeah, it'’s gonna be a late night. Yeah. You... We should think about ordering food. Great idea. What do you want? Um, sushi takeout? Sushi takeout? This is Vermont. Italian? You got it. Pizza it is. - So I like pepperoni mushroom. - [Phone ringing] Hello? Mr. Bullock! Mr. Bullock! Mr. Bullock, I have Riley Thomas on line one. Finally. Thomas, what in the world is going on there? Have you lost your mind? Just one minute, sir. Mr. Bullock, can you please give me a chance to explain? Sweaters, Thomas? You disobeyed my direct orders, and you do it for sweaters? Yes, sir, I know, but those sweaters provided an opportunity to bring new business to OutWear. So what next, fuzzy mittens, cashmere nose warmers? That'’s not what I sent you there for. I know, but the people here, they rely on these jobs. This is a serious problem, Thomas. I saw an opportunity to do something good, and I took it. All you'’ve done is create more problems. I had to try. What if the sweaters are a success? What if they'’re not? What if they'’re just a hiccup in a failing company? Anybody see where Riley went? That way. These people have invested everything in this place. When I came here, they looked at me with hope. How could I tell them that my sole purpose in coming here was to fire everyone and dismantle the company and sell everything for scraps? That'’s going to happen anyway, Thomas. Maybe, but at least I tried. Riley, I want you on the first plane back to New York. Clearly you'’ve made a huge mess of things. Sir, respectfully, I disagree. I have to call you back. MR. BULLOCK: Hello? - Did she just hang up on me? - I-I don'’t-- I'’m supposed to hang up on her! I don'’t think she would have done that, sir. She didn'’t hang up-- Yes, she hung up on you. This younger generation, I swear, no respect. No respect whatsoever. No, I have respect, sir. I'’m younger, I have respect, I'’m a respectful guy. You'’re smaller. True. That is duly noted. I hate my job so much. Wyatt, wait! What you heard, I can explain all of that. You don'’t have to explain anything. I think I got the gist of it just fine. What'’s going on? Wanna tell him? Wyatt, please? She was never here to help us. She was sent here to lay everybody off, shut the company down and sell it for-- What'’d you call it? WYATT: Scraps. Is that true? Yeah. Initially. But then I came here and met all of you and saw this place. Please understand. Oh, I understand just fine. The cost reports, the itemization. You were just trying to find out how much you could sell us for! You never cared about this place, about us. We were just a stepping stone for you to get somewhere. You know what? Congratulations. You earned it. You are being unreasonable and unfair. There was always a chance that this place could close. You know that. That is how corporate business works. Is it corporate business to lie to everybody? To exploit people'’s hopes so that you can get ahead? It never mattered to you whether we raised that money or not. That'’s not your problem, right? That is not fair. We created a product together. Why would I do that if it didn'’t matter to me? Well, it'’s like you said. Things from the city don'’t work here. You'’re just another import from New York that doesn'’t belong. I'’m sorry. What? What'’d I do? Where do you want me to start? Let'’s give '’em some space. She lied to us, Nick. We'’re probably gonna lose everything. The company you built from the ground up. Doesn'’t that bother you? Well, nothing lasts forever, Wyatt. Riley may not have been totally forthcoming, but the girl was genuine. As for this place, it'’s been more alive the last couple of days than it has been since we opened. I know what I heard, Nick.

I hate to be the bearer of more bad news, but sweater sales have started to slow down. I don'’t think it'’s because of a lack of interest. It'’s just we didn'’t have enough time to get the word out. What should we do? Well, we all knew this could possibly be our last hurrah, but, uh, look... I just want to say something. It'’s been an honor working with all you guys. I want to thank you for your hard work and your dedication, and I'’m proud of all of you. We'’re proud of you. We got one last party to have under this roof, so let'’s make it a good one. Yes, absolutely. - We'’re with you. - Yes. Let'’s do it. RILEY: Oh, sales have stalled. Don'’t look so happy to see me. I might get used to it. Oh. Earth to Riley! I'’m sorry. What? Are you still thinking about the Land of Misfit Toys? Don'’t call it that. And yes, I am. I told you not to get too attached. Now look what'’s happening. Lucky for you, your little spike in sweater sales will help you find a job somewhere else. I don'’t know. It'’s not really about the job. Who cares? I do. I care. I wanted to help them, David. I wanted to help them so much. But you didn'’t, so end of story. I learned so much about myself while I was there. Like part of me that has been missing, that I didn'’t even know existed. I'’m sorry. What are you saying? I'’m saying that I am not like you. I thought maybe I was, but I'’m not, and I don'’t ever want to be. What? Riley... Those people, they help each other. Whatever world this is that we'’re living in, where we only look out for ourselves, I'’m done. I don'’t want to be part of it anymore. You can'’t be serious. I should go. I can'’t believe you'’re doing this. What'’s gotten into you, Riley? Christmas. Christmas has gotten into me. Riley? Riley Thomas! Dana, hi. I thought that might be you. I heard you were out of town. Yeah, I was. I just got back. Beautiful sweater. Thank you. My nephew gave it to me. Keeps me warm on a cold day. I know the feeling. Well, you'’re back just in time. It'’s nice to be where the heart is for the holidays. Yeah. I was gonna go into Delorie'’s. Care to join me? No, thank you. I actually just left. All right. Well, maybe another time. Yeah, I'’d like that. Merry Christmas, dear. Merry Christmas to you too. Dana? There'’s something I'’d like to talk to you about. Just not here. It'’s a little crowded tonight. All right, well, lead the way. I think I see a booth over there. Perfect. So have you met with Preston yet? I know he'’s been anxious to see you. No. I haven'’t dared show my face. Oh? Why? Well, he'’s gonna fire me the second he sees me. Oh, no. There you go. Would you ladies like to start with something to drink? Oh, just coffee for me, thanks. Me too. It'’s all right. I asked for it. Actually, I begged for it. But you know what? I don'’t care. I made a choice, and I stuck with it. Should I ask? What exactly did you do? Dana, you and I don'’t know each other that well. We'’ve had some business dealings since your firm decided to invest in Bullock & Barnes. We have, and I'’ve enjoyed watching your progress. You show a lot of potential. Thank you. But that is behind me now. I took on an assignment, one that was pretty important to Mr. Bullock. He put a lot of faith in me, and at the time, it seemed pretty cut and dry. But it wasn'’t. No, it wasn'’t. I didn'’t count on the human element. The faces and the smiles. The very lives of the people. The lives that I was about to turn upside-down. It can be pretty tough. It was impossible. Thanks. Dana, I'’m not the same person that I was when I left a few weeks ago. What'’s changed? It'’s difficult to put into words. I just don'’t feel the same anymore. Despite what I had promised Mr. Bullock, I did the opposite. I tried to right the ship and save the company. I almost did it too. But that isn'’t why Bullock sent you there. I came that close. A bold move, as they say. Sorry it didn'’t work out. Now, Riley, how can I help you with this? ♪ Christmas is coming ♪ ♪ It'’s that time of year ♪ ♪ When family comes calling ♪ ♪ From far and near ♪ [phone vibrates] Hello? How is that big Christmas party going? Oh, fine. I was just, uh... I was just finishing up some work. Wyatt, it'’s Christmas Eve. Believe me, I know. Honey, you will get through this. You always do. It'’s not that. It'’s just... everyone was depending on me, you know? When Nick hired me to take over, he trusted me with his life'’s work, with the town'’s work, and I feel like... I feel like I let him down. I feel like I let everybody down. Honey, anybody else would have walked away from this a long time ago, but not you. You did what you always do. You just hung in there till the bitter end because you'’re a fighter, Wyatt. And they are darn lucky to have you. Sure doesn'’t feel like it. Look, I know it'’s a shame, and this Riley girl sounded really special. [Chuckles] I really don'’t know what to do anymore, Mom. Riley'’s gone. I'’m unemployed. Well, you still have me. Thanks. And you are still coming over tomorrow, right? I mean, Uncle Gene is making his famous homemade eggnog. Sounds delicious. All right, I'’ll see you tomorrow then. - Sure. - And you know what? You might still get that Christmas miracle. Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. - I love you, Mom. Mwah! Wyatt. Where you been hiding? Come on. Oh, you know how it is. Wow! You look festive. You like that? I don'’t know if you noticed or not, but there'’s a little party going on downstairs. I know, I know. I was just following up on our Internet stats. We'’re so close. Yeah, close. But enough is enough. Look, people are waiting for you. It'’s getting late. You need to show your face. - But I don'’t-- - There is no but. You gave it your best. And for what it'’s worth, I think Riley did too. We all did. Riley? You too, huh? Yeah. Go. Look, all your friends are asking for you, and Nick'’s running out of excuses. All right. Might as well go out with a bang, right? Or two. Or two. Merry Christmas, Wyatt. I started this company 50 years ago, and if tonight'’s the night it all closes down, I don'’t want it to be with tears. I want it to be with a toast. I'’ll need another one of these. Steve, can we get a refill, man? Thanks. - Here you go. - Thanks, Steve You'’re welcome. Listen up, everybody. Most of you have probably heard this story, but for those who haven'’t, it'’s a true story. Way back in the first winter of World War I, soldiers from both sides ceased fire for a whole day so that they could come together to celebrate Christmas. Kind of reminds me that wherever we are, we can always use a little Christmas spirit. Took me a while to remember that. So... 50 years ago, I started this company with a sweater and a coat, and I never imagined that one day it would encompass all of you and your dedication, your creative energy and your wonderful work. So I say, as we stagger through the final hour, let'’s put aside any regrets we have about what we didn'’t do, and let'’s celebrate with joy for what we have achieved together. Merry Christmas, everybody. - Merry Christmas! - Hear, hear! Bullock wanted this place shut down by Christmas. So with the tolling of the clock, OutWear is officially... RILEY: Open for business. Riley? Riley? I'’m so sorry. I should have listened to you. I should have told you. I'’m sorry too. But what are you doing here? I came back because we'’re not done. It'’s not over. Unfortunately, my dear, it is done. You may have come back for nothing. Actually, I came back for everything. What are you talking about? When I got back to New York, I ran into a friend of mine who runs an investment firm. And the funny thing about investment firms is that they like to invest in things. A hint? I told her all about this wonderful place, full of wonderful people who try to put the wonder of Christmas into everything that they do, and... like me, she fell in love. And she was so taken by all of this that she has decided to invest fully in next year'’s OutWear classic line. - You mean... - Yep. OutWear is officially open for business. [Cheers and applause] Way to go. What about you? What about your boss? What does he think about all this? Why don'’t you ask him yourself? Merry Christmas, everybody! ALL: Merry Christmas, Mr. Bullock! - Nick, Wyatt. - Mr. Bullock. I don'’t know how you did it, Riley, but you managed to go around me and save OutWear from the scrapheap... for now. Thanks to Dana. MR. BULLOCK: Thanks to both of you. I have no choice but to allow the company to remain in business for the next year. Thank you, sir. That being said, there'’s still the matter of your job. You blew it, Thomas. You directly disobeyed me, and I can'’t have any free-thinkers working for me. It'’s unthinkable. [Chuckles] I wouldn'’t have it any other way, sir. That being said, Wyatt, don'’t be a fool. You'’ve got quite a girl there. I wouldn'’t let her get away if I were you. I think maybe we have room for one more apprentice. [Laughter] MR. BULLOCK: Good luck, Riley. I sure hope they know what they'’ve gotten themselves into. Somebody bring me a drink! Here you are, Mr. Bullock. I thought it would be a milkshake. Oh, okay, what kind? Tan, you idiot! - Tan, tan milkshake - Tan, it is. You know, a little of this, a little of that. Tan. There you are. I just... was taking everything in. There was a moment when I thought I might never see this place again. So you plan on staying? I'’m thinking about it. Something holding you back? Maybe. There'’s just one tiny little piece of the puzzle missing. Which one? You. Me? Yeah. I read somewhere recently that it only takes three seconds to fall in love, and the rest is denial. And? I don'’t want to live my life in denial anymore. Merry Christmas, Wyatt. [Applause] [cheering] [dog barking] [dog barks] I love it when a plan comes together. Hey, Gloria, any mail come in for me? - Yes, yes, here you go. - Thanks. Oh, and there'’s a package for you. - A package? - A present. - For me? - From Mr. Bullock. Mr. Bullock got me a present! Wha-- "Cyril." Wow. "Dear Cyril. Thank you for all your hard work. Here'’s a special something I know you'’ll get a lot of use out of in the years to come. Your boss and friend, Preston Bullock." Wow. Mr. Bullock, you shouldn'’t have. Mr. Bullock, you shouldn'’t have. "Tan." Merry Christmas, Mr. Bullock.
