Follow me into this wide wide world. Anywhere things are better than death. CONSTANTIN FILM presents a film by BERND EICHINGER "A GIRL CALLED ROSEMARIE" HÖCHST NEAR FRANKFURT, 1952 Suitcase on the table. The coat. One red dress. One black dress. Underwear. Two black bras. Pants, leopard print... One black garter belt. Aren't you a bit young for that? Becoming a big movie star, is that what you think of? That may be something for you. Those are my magazines. I paid for them. The belt. Shoes. Take the shoes off! Those are my shoes! - Come on, be good now. - Let me go! You little slut! You can go now. Sit down. Sit down, please. How can you behave like that? You'll get your things back. That's what you said last time. You're smarter than the other girls in here. Why are you doing this to yourself? I found foster parents for you. They're ready to take care of you. These are nice people. You'll stay with them when you get out of here... ...which will take a while this time. How long? One year, minimum. One year? The war ruined everything. All of us have to learn again what it means to live as a community. You, too. You'll be in an isolated cell first. You can go now. Look at this, you piece of trash! Oh, I see... ...that's what you want. You can have that anytime. You'll take me to kitchen now... you pig! And you'll unlock the delivery door. You're crazy! You think so? I'll say that you raped me. Nobody will believe you. What are you doing? Stop it! You won't get away with this, bitch. Hello, pretty woman. What is a little girl like you doing out on the street at night? Hey, what's the matter with you? Stupid cow. FRANKFURT, NORDEND, 1954 2 YEARS LATER Don't you ever stop, you slut. You need to be kept behind bars like a wild animal. For God's sake, stop it Hans! This doesn't make sense. Well, tell me what makes sense! She's out every night and looks like a whore. You're wasting away your youth in bars, with men that use you. You'll go to hell like all the other girls on the street. What you do out there is not living. And inside here, is that living? There you have it! Calm down, she's back now. She wants to work in retail. You promised me. Her - working? She thinks she's born a princess. You never had a penny in your whole life. It's not my fault that I don't have parents. We are your parents now! We probably aren't good enough. This is what she wants. Fancy dresses, expensive cars... - What's wrong with that? - We have to work for this, they don't! You're not a princess and no prince will marry you. If you continue this, you will never live a decent life. This is not our world. Rosemarie, he's right. You have to have an occupation... ...and look for a boy who'll marry you. So I can live like you? And die in a hole like this? You're telling me? We took you in like our own child! I work hard so you can live here! And stare at my tits and ass each morning. Or do you think I don't notice? I'm sorry. Where are you going, princess? Straight ahead. Good, that's exactly the way I'm going. FRANKFURT, 1956 2 YEARS LATER 16 glasses of Champagne, I've never seen anything like it. The cheapest dives are the best. At least here you can party, right? Look at me, Hartog, this is how it's done... Relax buddy, it's time to play, the night is young. Sorry, I didn't mean it. You are disgusting and pretentious! He finds me disgusting and pretentious. Why do you think I'm interested in what you have to say? Willie, stop it! Leave him alone. Get yourself and your lady something new. Something better looking... ...we do like some style around here. You can be unbearable. Come on Konrad, don't leave me hanging. You're the only bachelor. Over here! Manager! What is that? This is the curfew, sir. Throw out the mob over there and we'll have a private orgy. Money is freedom! That's why we love it, don't we, girls? And now, champagne for everyone! Cheers! I have to go. I promised Marga I'll meet her. You and your sister. She's already in the castle-moat with her prince. What is this with you and your sister? You have some sort of thing going on? Are you hurt? Are you injured? No, I'm alright, thank you. - Are you sure? - Yes. I was in a hurry. I didn't see you. I don't know... I'm sorry. I should take you to the hospital. You're trembling. Must be the shock. This doesn't happen to me every day. You're not from here. Is this an Essen license plate? Where do you live? Here, at the Palace Hotel. That's my direction. You can drive me, if that would make you feel better. Are you sure you're not hurt? Why didn't you stay at the bar with your friends? I have a date. I'm already late. Your friends seem to have a lot of fun. Those are not my friends, just business partners. I don't care much for that kind of pleasure. But all men like it. You don't like to have fun? This is gold. How much does it cost? I don't know. I really don't know what these things cost. What? Are you serious? You are funny. The men I know always talk about the cost of things. Really? Maybe you shouldn't get involved with those men. It sure is more interesting than working in a factory all day. And I make money, that's important. It was almost like you jumped in front of my car. I didn't see you at all. How do you know I didn't? You're crazy. You think so? I know girls who'd do more to meet a man like you. I already told you that this sort of pleasure doesn't appeal to me. Pull over. I want to show you something. It won't take long. Well? I just want you to look at me. You must have seduced many women. I don't know... Not really. Has a woman ever seduced you? I mean, really? I don't think I'd want that. I think you do. I can clearly feel it. Where have you been, love? Why aren't you in your room? I was worried about you. Brother dearest. We were supposed to meet five hours ago. You need a vacation. - I need lots I don't have time for. - You're silly. You know I'm game for anything. Who is she? How smart you are. Not smart, just more experienced. Judging by the scent, she's either on a budget... ...or very cheap. What's going on with you? You didn't fall in love... Aren't you going too far now? Sleep for a few hours. A lot is at stake tomorrow. I'll see you at breakfast. Hey, princess, think about it. Don't be dramatic, I'm not leaving the country. We can still see each other. That doesn't work. You owe me. For what? I picked you up, remember? Without me you'd have died out there. I think we did well. Listen, it worked, it was okay. Why are you leaving then? What do you want to hear? I said it was alright. I thought... I thought you liked me. I like you. So, there. But that's not enough, Tony. I thought we would build something together. Look at you. What am I supposed to build with you? You can't even iron your shirts. Tony, I have to move on. Move on. - What does that mean? - It means, I have to move on. You can't just leave me standing here. I can harm you. The police were asking if you lived here. Take care. See you. How are you? - You sinner... - How are you? Heavy negotiations all night, but quite successful... The Minister is already here. - Minister, nice to meet you. - Mr. Hartog. How are you? Gentlemen... You have to see this apartment. It is amazing! You'll like it. - And less than... - Hold on. Well... I'm so excited! Hello, are you still there? I can't talk now. - Hurry up. - I will come. I never had a TV before. I like this room. Everything else is so far away. It's as if we leave the whole world outside... ...as if time stood still. Sometimes in the Juvenile I felt the same way. You were in the Juvenile? Why? Maybe because I wasn't what people wanted me to be. I believe that. All they wanted me to do is marry and have children. Well? You don't want that? I do, but not just with anybody. If I ever get married, it will be to someone who has a lot to offer. Someone like you. I'll get some champagne. In three days when I'm back in Frankfurt, I will take you out... ...so you know what real champagne tastes like. That'll be the first time you go out with me. I want to buy something special, something great. All men will envy you and all women will be jealous. It's the most fun if everyone is annoyed. Of course. Which color do you think suits me best? - I don't know, black maybe? - Well, then... Cheers. Thank you. You're sweet. Don't say that! Only cheap girls say that. I will cost you plenty. Princess, where are you going? How is business? Come on, get in. I missed you. What is it you want? You look great. All expensive things... what do you have to do for that? Hey. As you can see, I need a new car. Why don't you buy one? I can ask your new boyfriend for one. - Keep out of this. - What? We always used to do business. We used to, not anymore. Here's a thousand Marks, that should last for a while. Tony, you have to learn how to make it on your own. One kiss? For old time's sake? Could it be you miss me too? Is that you? Get yourself a drink. I have to talk to you. I'm almost ready. Look up - the chandelier. Isn't it great? And so cheap. You want to go to the Ritz like that? I've never been to the Ritz. I thought you'd like it. - I'll put on something else. - Listen... I can't bring you along tonight. I'm sorry. I have to meet some business friends and their wives. Why can't I come? My fiancée will be there. You never told me you're engaged. Funny... ...I thought you knew. How was I to know? Are you angry with me now? No. I just thought... I don't really know what I was thinking. This doesn't have to change things between us. Is she pretty? Yes. Prettier than me? I don't know, you can't compare it. She is different. You won't marry her, will you? Come on, tell me about her. What does she look like? What do you like about her? Come on, tell me. What is she like in bed? Come on, talk to me. Is she gentle? Is she wild? Tell me... Come on, stop it. You're perverse. You know what? Your friends are right. Sometimes you're downright boring. I'll call you. We should put the top up. Why? It's raining. So what? This car needs to be driven top-down. Can't you drive a little faster? The car is brand new. I have to break in the engine. Let me drive. You don't have a license. - Pretty young. - Thank God. I mean the license, the day before yesterday. Alright then, let's try. But no faster than 80. A fast car needs to be driven fast. A great car! Don't be grumpy. I was looking forward to this trip. Have you gone insane? Pull over immediately. You call this a cozy restaurant? I don't want to stay. I'll tell you later. Now we might as well... Who is that? - She's very elegant. - My sister. Your sister? I'm just hoping it's not your fiancée. She's really my sister. I forgot that her equestrian club party is today. Excuse me a second, I have to say hello. Order anything you like. Sorry, I totally forgot about it. - It's just coincidence. - You're kidding. You forgot we're riding today and that Fribert is coming? That, too! I told you five weeks ago - you need a vacation. You're a basket case. Or is it the lady? Nonsense. Don't say that. She's pretty... ...but not for you. You can't handle her. What's her name? Rosemarie. - Rosemarie what? - She's not a princess. It's Nitribit. Sounds like an explosive. Is this her stage name, or something? Don't be so rude. The name is real. - I should say hello to Hans Bernhard. - Forget about it. Say hello when we start riding. - I can't go with you. - You have to. Hans Bernhard picked up Fribert at the airport last night. In the afternoon he met the Minister, and now he is here. The program has to go on. Okay, I'll join you. Not with her, are you? She's already here. I can't just send her off? Are you out of your mind? What're our acquaintances going to think? I don't care. I'm not married. What's wrong with you? You will send her away now. What is this tone you're using with me? Go on, she's getting impatient. Keep her happy, so you can get rid of her. She's a bit flashy. But lively. We'll meet in half an hour. She didn't want you at her table, right? She wanted to talk to me in private. She wants you to join the party without me. Yes. That is... no. What will you do? This situation is all my fault. I forgot something else. A French industrialist is coming. It's important. I have to meet him. In short, you have to go. What are your plans for me? I can't take you along. Why not? - You won't understand. - Then explain it. You furnish my apartment, you dress me up, and then you send me home. If you just want someone to fuck, you could get that cheaper... Don't talk like that. It's okay. How do I get home? I'll give you the car. Your car. And you? Marga will take me. When will you be back? The ride starts at three, one hour, and then Fribert. - Is that the French guy? - Yes. I would say, 7 o'clock at your place. Will she tell your fiancée? Marga? Never. She knows nothing about us. She knows everything. Is she married to the guy next to her? The guy is a Prince. Her husband died in the war. Lucky him. I don't like you like that. Likewise. You'll need some gas. - Fill'er up. - Certainly. I am completely lost. That happens. But I think you're going the right direction. Really, you're making me curious. You're going to the equestrian event. You're French. How come your German is so good? How do you know all this? I know you're expected in Arnoldsheim. Wonderful. Why don't you come with me? I'm not expected. A beautiful lady like you is always being expected. I don't ride. I don't intend to either. We'll watch the others as they fall. You're not French. I swear I am, but from the Alsace. Are you coming? That's fine. My name is Alfons Fribert. I know. My name is Rosemarie. Enchanted, my love. Why don't they start? You know it always takes a while. But it's worth it. This is too much. Look at this. That little slut. Do something. The guy next to her is Fribert. Well then, break a leg. Welcome, Mr. Fribert. You found it. I was completely lost. Fortunately, this young lady saved me. - Have you met? - I think not. Then allow me, Prince Oelsen, Miss Rosemarie... ...Nitribit. Sounds explosive. Pardon me, but do you have an invitation? Me? No. In France, the beauty of a woman is her invitation. With all respect, Sir, we are not in France. The lady is being escorted by me. Of course. Thank you kindly. Ah, our French guest. How are you? Nice to meet you. I hope you like our home. And you miss... A present from Paris... for us? No, Ms. Nitribit is not from France, unfortunately... That doesn't matter. You have to be French to make an entrance like this. Sir, I would like to meet Mr. Hartog. Konrad, Konrad! Konrad... ...your presence is requested. Mr. Hartog, Mr. Fribert. - My pleasure. - I'm pleased to finally meet you. So, to good company and good business. This is the young lady who helped me find my way. - Mr. Hartog, Ms. Nitribit. - Hello. Are you some sort of CEO? You're aiming too high, Miss. I have nothing to say around here. Shall we talk for a while? How do you like it here? I like it. A lovely person. So Not-German... Sorry. At first, I thought she belongs to your club. And where was that? At a gas station. Congratulations, I bet you were great. Mr. Fribert, my sister Marga. - Hello. - Pleasure. - Weren't you accompanied? - Yes. I wasn't sure of my success. Looks like the lady is being accepted into the club. It just looks that way. Stay - we're all going to Wiesbaden later. No, I'm afraid not. - May I walk you to your car? - That's not necessary. - I really have to go. - Well, then... You put me in a very awkward position. You are unbelievable! I don't like to be sent away. - The entire club... - Why so upset? Nothing happened. That's what you think. This is high society. You don't have a clue. I know where I'm from. I'm not part of this society. So what?! I'll become part of it. How difficult can that be? All your friends thought I fit right in. I could cheat on you with every one of them. I'll leave the car outside your hotel. Yes. Mr. Fribert, what a surprise. No I can't. I'm waiting for a friend. Yes, too bad. Some other time. I need a number in Essen. Hartog, Konrad. May I help you? No, no. Maybe you can. Is Mr. Hartog in? Mr. Hartog's not here. I haven't seen him in several weeks. Do you have a new reservation? I'm sorry. Fine. Miss. I'm so glad to finally see you again. - You're just being nice... - No, otherwise I wouldn't have called. I missed you. Everything was so boring without you. Each day a new dinner, a new factory. Mr. Hartog was tireless. Mr. Hartog. He opened all the doors for me. His fiancée is lovely by the way. But, getting back to us... Between us, people here generally don't have much of a zest for life. But with you here, it's already much more entertaining. I have to visit one more factory today. Thank God it's the last one. You know what? Come along! If you come along, it'll be fun! The head of the department has to ensure submission of production plans. I want to be informed about details at 10 AM and 3 PM. Mr. Fribert and a lady. How embarrassing. Why didn't you tell me it's 4 o'clock already? Come on, come on. I'm early. Hope it's not an inconvenience. Mr. Fribert, you'll always be received with open arms by a European brother... ...unless you're scared of a semi-nude Teutone. I'm used to quite a bit... The lady from the equestrian club. The angel with the SL... ...the French, always surrounded by beauty. You shall recognize us by our weakness. - How do you recognize us? - By your unlimited efficiency. Sounds terrible, but has some truth to it... ...my fortune is growing as tall as I grow wide. Champagne! He's harmless. His name is Champagne. I only need to call once, and dog and champagne come at the same time. Efficient to the extreme, right? Charming. May I take Mr. Fribert away for a moment? So we can talk about making a human being of myself. I like animals. We talked about your offer. And? You should rethink your terms since we let you join our business. We're contributing 50 million dollars. That may have impressed us five years ago. So, you don't want our business? What I want to say is, we don't need your money, but we can use it. You see the globe there? Push the top button. Colossal, isn't it? Make yourself a drink. My partners want to know what will happen to the 50 million. What can possibly happen? Defense contracts are a license to get rich. This license must be earned! Good morning, director. This thing shits 2000 tons a day. Do you see that? What do you say? - Impressive. - Impressive? It's huge! Production increase per year 1000%. Imagine that! 1945 this whole area was gone - nothing but a bomb crater. Come on. Two more years and we'll outdo the British. And they won the war! Let's go, so your pretty ears won't go deaf. A very impressive plant you have there. Can I say something? From time to time a war can do wonders, like a lighting storm. All the dirt gets washed away. You know what I mean. What do you say to that? Looks like a bomb. 80 of these came down here in 1945. This was a misfire. Now, the tomb of the unknown worker. Is this gold? Gold-plated. American? Of course, American. It had a note 'back to the stone age'. That's what they thought... today we export into 92 countries. Tell your people in Paris what you saw and tell them... ...we do our best when left alone. May I take pictures? Certainly. Miss, would you please... You have to promise me something. Bring Ms. Nitribit from time to time, even if we don't do business. At your service. Two golden bombshells. Thank God, this is done. Will you go out with me? Where? It's a surprise. Let's go. To the contrary. It'll be fun, you'll see. Good evening. Good evening, madam. Enchanted. Your shoes are interesting. Maybe a bit... golden. The Lady and I have a lot to talk about, have a nice evening. Have a seat. The menu and a bottle of Dom Perrignon please. Who does she think she is? She's right. Thank you. I recommend the Confit Canard. Two please, and we'll start with the soup. Yes, Sir. Some wine with the Confit? - Do you have a '47 Petrus? - Excellent. May I? You're an extremely attractive woman. What you're lacking is seemliness. I don't know what that means, but so far no man has complained. Not even Hartog? He hasn't been with you since the equestrian event, right? There are no prices on this menu. You see, that's what I mean. Hartog is a Romantic. He will marry in a few weeks. He will not continue relations with you. Did he tell you that? You are not presentable... You must have noticed. You shouldn't get mad when I tell you the truth, especially if we do business. You saw Bruster today, his home, his factory. They're all like him. In ten years they built giant factories. I'm explaining the connection between your bed and the economic miracle... ...but you don't listen. Connection between bed and economic miracle. You have to look like a Lady with international flair, elegance... Your dresses have to be from Paris, like your perfume and jewelry. Just the right thing for your economic miracle men. The Germans are great organizers, but they're square, and they know it. They want something exciting - a worldly Lady. Then they can feel like great Europeans. That, Miss, is your big chance. But you'll have to learn two things. First... ...stop dreaming about Hartog marrying you. And second? Second, you have to learn how to behave. Like Bruster? Bruster is a billionaire. Billionaires don't have to behave. And what is your job? I will teach you everything. How do I say 'no' in elite circles? In elite circles you never say 'no'. You say 'I will think about it'. I will think about it. Mr. Hartog. I have a business preposition. Then call my office and make an appointment. One more question... Do you know the number 3527 in Essen? I called it yesterday and a nice lady picked up. She told me you'd be at a congress in Munich today. And? I thought the lady may want to know you're here so she doesn't worry. You're wasting your time, boy. Stay as you are. You scared me. I haven't heard from you in a long time. This place has changed. Come, let me show you. I thought I better buy a larger one so you won't fall out. Come, let's give it a test run. Come on, I haven't had you in so long. I thought you wouldn't come back. That might have been better. What do you mean? You can't leave me alone for this long. Looks like you were doing just fine without me. The dear sister squealed. I should have known. It wasn't necessary. Everyone knows about your affair with Fribert. I don't have an affair with Fribert. He shows me things, takes me out. He's nice to me. It's not easy waiting around for you for weeks. But if you mind, I'll stop seeing him. It's not just Fribert. You're constantly jeopardizing my reputation. Are you jealous? Why would I jeopardize your reputation? Your little stint at the equestrian club, and your visit at Bruster. How can you just show up at residences of business friends? And you always go places that friends of mine frequent. You can't do that. You expect me to stay home and wait for your visit every few weeks? You even called me at home. Maybe next time you'll chat with my fiancée. There are rules. Those may be your rules, not mine. I'm paying so you follow my rules, don't forget that. Giving me money does not mean you own me. You can treat your boring fiancée like this, not me. Don't talk about her like this. If she means so much to you, why aren't you with her? - Why pay me if she's perfect? - Shut up. She will raise a few brats and you'll beg me for a good lay. I'm sorry. I know men, believe me. And I know your hidden side. You fall in love, you marry, but you still come to someone like me. You go nuts or you cry since your wives are so dull... ...and you're scared of aging. - Nonsense! - Love is only temporary glue. You can't think of something more trite? I thought we were different... ...that we had something special. I'm not as educated as you, but I know one thing... There are two things in this world that count... Money and sex. What you're saying is unbelievable. You can't be serious. But it's true and you know it. Be with me - we are a match. It won't work. Forget your fiancée. We'll be rich, have fun and no one can ever harm us. Not even the guy down there, trying to blackmail me? Son of a bitch! You piece of shit! I'll kill you! Are you out of your mind? My car. - See what you've done? - What did you tell him? - I do my business, you do yours. - Blackmail! Have you lost it? You mess with me again and I'll make sure you go to jail for a long time. Oh, yes? How? I know enough to put you away for at least 3 years. You're going to squeal? You don't have the nerve! Listen, asshole, if you mess with my business again you'll go behind bars. Even if I have to fuck the chief of police. He'll leave you alone. What's going on? I was thinking. We will end our arrangement. It's too complicated for both of us. I'm serious, it makes no sense. I can't afford you. You don't belong in my life and I don't belong in yours. I'm sorry. I should have never let it come this far. You still owe me money. What is that? My cash-book. How much? Give me the Mercedes. You want my car? I don't want to leave you. You want to leave me and that has to cost. If not for you, I could have made a lot of money. Fine. - I'll give you the money for the car. - I want the one down there. What does a car like this cost? Eighteen thousand, why? Spend the night, you paid for it. I want to be able to say I got 18,000 for one night. If we should meet somewhere... I don't know you. Put everything on the chair. - What do I do with a piano? - It's not a piano, it's culture. Indispensable, if you want to impress. But I can't play. It's simple. Is there something you can't do? The latest rage. The new rich are crazy for it. You don't have to do anything, but pick the song. Dior, Chanel... you will remember those names. You won't be wearing anything else from now on. That's the basic equipment. You are unbelievable! Stop it. What are you doing? Remember your first lesson. Don't mix business and pleasure. Sounds trite, but it's true. I didn't buy this so you sleep with me, but to sleep with others. By the way, you owe me 12,000 Marks. Do you know what this is? A tape recorder. A very special one. I want you to turn it on when you have visitors. Does that turn you on? In a way it does. It's important that the visitor's name is recorded on tape. Isn't that illegal? Put this stuff on. The men on this tape aren't likely to tell the police. Knowing you, I'm sure you have an outrageous plan. - I don't want to be dragged into this. - Don't worry, nothing will happen. Just do as I say. Well now... This already looks much better. And how fast it was. This is the list of your customers' names. These are all business friends of Hartog. The first thing you lose in war is your innocence. Here you go, Madam. I have an appointment here. My friend seems to be late. That is unforgivable! Why don't you join us? - This is Minister Hoff. - Pleasure. Dr. Waldmann, United Chemical Works. The panty hose you're wearing was probably made by him. If I knew this hose would dress these fine legs, I would've made them myself. And put them on me yourself? Since you're here, I have a photo you might like. This was taken outside my factory. This is a great advertising shot. Can I buy it? Oh, please, keep it. That's what I like. Champagne! Could I talk to you for a moment? Who would turn this down? I would like you to visit me tonight. I always found you... impressive. Good gracious. Don't get me wrong. I'd love to come, but I can't. I have a dinner date. Then come afterwards. What would it cost? One thousand. One thousand? Even in Paris I didn't pay that much. Fine. Let's say 2,000 then. Alright, 10 PM. We can marry if you want. Just promise you won't wear panties under your wedding dress. Better yet, nothing at all! I can't do anything with my wife. She only likes the missionary position, and I said... "Are we in Africa, or what?" All the cognac has taken a toll on her brain. I think sometimes she's doesn't even recognize me on top of her. 1000 years of royal incest. My big little Pooh Bear. I should tell you about Hickock and me in London, okay, but that's it. He says to my offer, "Absolutely not acceptable", and you know what I said... "Either you accept my offer or you'll be crossing Jordan." He asks me, "Crossing whom?" I could listen to your jokes for hours. What a lovely beast you are... ...with skin like powdered sugar... ...and small, sweet paws with small sharp claws. I may just bite them off one day. One after the other. You won't believe this, but I haven't had sex in three years. I think I disgust my wife. - That is sad. - It is, isn't it. Do you know what this does to a man? I am 48 and sometimes at night... ...I don't know... ...I lie next to her and I think, why don't you just strangle her? Thank you. - I'm sorry. - Don't worry. You think I'm a lunatic. Keep talking. I understand very well. I don't want to be just anybody coming to you. You are someone very special to me. Without you... I may as well kill myself. And Dubors reached out his arm to grab Justine... ...and press her against his loins. But the heart-warming creature freed herself and shouted in tears... "Dear Lord, is there neither decency nor charity among mankind?" Dubors opened up his coat, which so far hid his arousal, and showed Justine. Abracadabra... ...alacazan. Wait, wait. I can't wait. We'll marry if you want. Why not? Since you came along my body tingles all over. - I want to be submissive. - I want to be bad. - Make a love potion of my blood. - Nothing is important, nothing matters. It's in the past... What did I want to say? Oh yes - how much I thank you. I feel better than ever. My skin is breathing. If I knew just one song, I would sing. Don't laugh. Everybody just wants to be happy. The whole world talks about it... ...but no one is, believe me. Nobody I know, and I know many. They are far from happy, in fact... ...they are unhappy for the most part. All of them. And the whole world thinks Germans work around the clock. Happy? Yes. Not bad. All that talk made me forget time. I have to go. Your old friend Hartog invited me to the opera. He invited you? Why is that strange? I always get invited, you know that. I want to join you. Give me five minutes to change. I don't think Hartog would approve. His fiancée is with him. I'm with you. Since when does the opera interest you? No, don't say it, let me guess... You only want to go, because Hartog is there. You're still upset, because he left you. Right? - The things you say... - Admit it. You want revenge. Or do you still want to marry him? Unfortunately, I only have one ticket. I admit the thought of you next to Hartog and his fiancée is quite a thrill. You are disgusting. Hide the tapes somewhere, but not in your apartment. Please, be quiet madam. Your box is over there, but you can't go in right now. I'm sorry. Why? I paid for the ticket? Yes, but the opera has started. You'll have to wait till intermission. That simply can't be. What am I going to do now? Is there nothing you can do? It is strictly forbidden, but I can open the door a little so you can hear the music. Please, be quiet. I will lose my job. It's wonderful. Don't you think? What? You're crying! Well, Verdi. There's nothing more beautiful. When is the intermission? I don't see what you like about Verdi. He is pompous and sentimental. But I saw tears in your eyes, admit it. Nonsense. I had something in my eye. I usually agree with Marga, but Verdi pompous? No... Wagner. - I need a drink, I'll be at the bar. - I'll meet you there. Verdi - I remember a performance at the Milan Scala... A glass of champagne, please. We only have sparkling wine. Alright, that's fine. Since when do you come to the opera? Sorry, have we met? If you must know, I love the opera. I'm mad about it. I desperately need a drink. My throat dried out. Is this yours? Thank you. Konrad, won't you introduce me? Ms. Nitribit, my fiancée. Christine Bergmann. You look lovely. Is this from Paris? I believe so. - Do something - get her. - Yes. I know most of Konrad's friends. Why have we never met? In my line of work, discretion is essential. Easy. Come on, let's go. What line of work would that be? I believe it's called the 'horizontal one' in your circles. Excuse me... ...I have to steal you away. A few of my friends want to meet you. Don't say anything. We'll talk about it another time. Wait, Christine. I won't be there when you get home. Please, take me away from here. You deserve a slap in your face. I'd do it myself if there wasn't anyone around. That's why I love aristocrats. They always know how to behave... ...as long as they're in public. You are an excessively shameless person. I know. Alright. Alright. I want to talk to my brother. Why do you think he's here? He didn't come home to his cage last night? I'm telling you, your brother isn't here. I know exactly what you want, but it won't work. There's no room for you in his life. If you're so sure, why are you here? My brother's a child. You have to watch him. That doesn't mean he's retarded. Do you seriously think he would marry a whore? I wouldn't be the first whore to marry a director... ...though I would prefer a Prince. May I? The bedroom is in the back, to your left. - Marga! - Hans Bernhard! One day you'll go too far. That's exactly where I want to go! It took a long time, but we finally have an approval. Mr. Fribert didn't get everything he wanted, but that's the way of business. Let's toast to this successful business conclusion. One moment. There's something I want to make you aware of. As you know, I have an acquaintance that all of you visit from time to time. A few days ago, I found out that this lady has recorded your visits on tape. Not now, you idiot! I believe, however, that I can convince her to hand over those tapes... ...under certain conditions, of course. Sir, what you're doing here is blackmail. I will notify the district attorney about your statement. You're misunderstanding, Minister. I want to help... all of you. To your health! Christine, I have to tell you something. Our business cartel is being blackmailed. She recorded tapes of her customers' visits. She? We believe that Fribert has the tapes. He uses them to force his conditions. Practically everyone is involved. You, too? I don't think there're tapes of me. I never was in her new apartment. But I'm entirely responsible. Through me she gained access to our circle. A terrible situation. What will you do? My business partners need those tapes. Why don't you go to the police? That would make the scandal perfect, it wouldn't help - there's not enough time. Tomorrow the contracts with Fribert are supposed to be signed. He will not give us any bargaining room. Maybe she still has the tapes or knows where they are. Why don't you just pay her? Being bought is her profession. That's the plan. We'll offer a lot of money. I'm supposed to go to Frankfurt to talk to her. Why you? Bruster, Schmidt, Kaiser... all of them think that I may influence her the most. But I will try. The party at Bruster is in two days. I'll have the driver take you. Must we go to this stupid party? Bruster is giving it in honor of our wedding. He never misses a chance to show off. The heads of the royal and industrial society. How can we not go? I'm afraid you're right. You're the best thing that ever happened to me... ...and I almost lost you. We returned to each other, that's all that matters. Let's not talk about it again. I love you. I know, otherwise I wouldn't be here. You don't seem to have any luck today, Mr. Fribert. I'll try again tomorrow. Hello. Rosemarie. Who is it, Martha? The mailman. I have to run. I just wanted to give you this. What is it? How are you? You look like the ladies in the magazines. Come in. I'm doing fine, Mom. I got married. - You have... - Say hello to Dad. I'll stop by again. Open up. It's me. Fribert. Looks like somebody stopped by. Where were you? I tried to get a hold of you. Did you follow me in the garage? I parked my car outside your house. Why? Someone followed me. Looks like some honorable men try to save their honorable asses. Maybe they tried to find the tapes, what do you think? You told me not to leave the tapes in the apartment. Great, so let's get them. It's about time. I need to get back to the hotel, I don't want to keep the gentlemen waiting. I can't give you the tapes. Would you repeat that, please. You won't get the tapes now. If not now, when? Yes. No, I'm not interested. Leave me alone. No. Your offer doesn't interest me. Who's making offers? It suddenly dawns on me... ...could it be you want to sell the tapes and keep me out of the loop? You stupid bitch! You don't really think this will fly, do you? I'll do you in like that! Nobody will care. You're nothing but a little hooker. You are scum and filth. If I don't finish you, they will. You provoking society. You can't afford that. This lousy crowd? They'll throw you in the gutter where you came from. And you? You're part of this. Excuse me? I am the society. Enough now. Where are the tapes? Gone. Yours, too. I knew that one day I'll need one for you, too. Watch it. You're stepping on thin ice now. Very thin. Go on, I have plenty of glasses. It's more than a quarter after ten. Nasty situation. I'm telling you, Fribert's not coming. We should've given her more money. She didn't want to listen! Mr. Fribert. Let him in. Good evening. Good evening. Your presence tells me that your efforts with Ms. Nitribit failed. One should always try. I have to tell you that my persuasion technique wasn't successful either. Does that mean you can't keep your end of the deal? The items would be in your possession if I had them. Well, isn't that lovely. Feels like we're in a puppet show. Well, gentlemen... ...what are we doing now? What is it? She's downstairs in the bar. She wants to talk to you, Konrad. Mr. Hartog is coming. Gentlemen, I'll be back. Looks like the game is over. We'll see. The Martini is for you. Sit down. You look like a waiter waiting for the order. I want you back with me. Just so we're clear... I wouldn't be sitting here, if it wasn't for the tapes. That's what I mean. I have the tapes. I can give them to you. You just have to return to me. What are you saying? Marry me. You want to force me to marry you? Why not? You're crazy. - You're insane! - Why? I can be every woman to you. Rosemarie, I told you before... ...it's impossible. It's senseless to talk about it. But I want to talk about it. - You don't understand... - At the opera... ...when you gave me a light, your hand was trembling. That's of no importance. But I saw it! Listen... You'll get 200,000 Marks for the tapes. Leave Frankfurt for a few months. You can travel wherever you want and live like a rich lady. I don't need your money. I have enough money. Give me the tapes, Rosemarie. I'll give you 100,000 myself. That's 300,000 Marks. That's my last word. Is it Fribert? Fribert will leave. He was the reason you stopped seeing me. By now there are dozens, hundreds. When two men meet at the hotel or airport, they talk about you. It doesn't have to stay that way. It can change. Rosemarie, give me the tapes. You don't know what you're getting into. Think about it. All right. Your answer? Princess. What luster in my humble adobe. Not much has changed. You'll be surprised. Prosperity will come. Real Estate Loans. Big business, hey? Not insignificant. Let me do that. You look tired. I've never seen you this tired. You can lay down if you like. It may not fit your standards, but... I'd rather have a drink. If your pompous asses annoy you, tell me. I have connections everywhere. I can cause them a lot of trouble. You can count on that. Come here. This is more than 50,000 Marks. For you. You can keep it. I know you. Something's wrong. Is it Hartog? I'm just tired, that's all. You can stay with me, if you like. I'm now in the real estate business. The money comes by itself. There's nothing you can do wrong. Come, stay here. We had a good time together. We did. I'll make big money and we'll live like the rich. No one can touch us. The things you say... It will never happen. Stay here. We're a match. What do you want from those people? You shouldn't be with them. They'll just ruin you. And what happens if I stay? Something always happens. We could have a few kids. I have to go. Yes, you always have to go. Take care. Rosemarie! Stay! Who's going to iron my shirts? Do you recall an October with this much snow? We couldn't even get out of the garage. Darling had to shovel. I dream of cherry blossoms in Japan when it snows. Who's still going to Japan? We'll plant cherry trees in our park so we don't have to go to Japan, right? Then the Japanese will come to us. Your invitation, please. I think we have to check if the guests have enough to drink. She's unbelievable! Do something! How do I get rid of her without a scandal? How does she find the courage to just show up! Come on, let's go. She's finally where she wanted to be. The question is: for how long? Good evening. Good evening. He'll be right back. What is this? No idea... ...but she looks good. So so. Hello, Willie. What do you want? Nothing. Just some fun. You always told me about your parties and I must say, hats off. You look great. There you go. Now you dare to look at me. Chin up, Willie. And now, dear, I want to know if you really are a great dancer. No, you can't do that. Yes, I can. You're an excellent dancer, my big teddy bear. It all depends on who you dance with. Not so loud. I don't care. I should be allowed to have some fun at my own party. Willie... ...would you come? Yes, Mama, I'm coming. I'll be right back. Orchestra! Drum roll. Ladies and gentlemen, please move to the salon. Yes! What is this? Your husband desperately wants to dance with me. An impertinent person! Why doesn't anyone stop her? - Let's dance. - You never dance. Now I do. May I? Isn't it a wonderful party? Very nice. You have some nerve! It's wonderful to be loved by everyone. Rosemarie Nitribit was killed in her apartment the same night. It was October 29, 1957. The murderer was never found.
