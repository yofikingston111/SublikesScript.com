Let me see his face properly What a little darling! I am not in touch with Subir all that much today. But I think the last time... I met him was... when a foreigner came to take our photographs. We had gone to Boral. That's when I met him. The entire thing was organized by... Mr. Nemai Ghosh, Ray's still photographer. Filmmaker Bo Vanders had come from Brussels to make a documentary on me. They had "Pather Panchali's" Apu and Durga in their script. They were looking for Apu. I told them... of his ancestral home near Wireless Park (Kudghat, Tollygunge). That is where he lives now. They did find him there. And... This is Subir. He played good football. I don't know why he didn't continue! Dada(brother) is leaving for Dhanbad tomorrow. He found a job. Father is not very well either. How can I possibly leave town to play a match? You... give up too soon. Once you're off, Sujoy and Alok will get into the team. What else can I do? When you go, I can stay over at your place. Moloy, you're making it look like a World Cup match! You're in form this season. Manna says the Mohanbagan Club will absorb you. Mohanbagan? Me??- - I swear, he said so! Never. East Bengal Club. If I play at all. German Refugee Team? You are the typical Ghoti (orthodox townsman). We're refugees. So is our team. We score 3 for 0 in the league. That's an accident. An accident, is it? Heard of anyone getting allergies for eating Hilsa? No.- - Happens with prawns! Let's go. I've committed a blunder. Should've asked Pramod to give my proxy at attendance! He's not very friendly with... The opposite lane. Third house on the right. Second floor. But he's a very cranky fellow. Watch out! 'Cranky', or short-tempered? You'll know when you see him. Go on. All the best! Why don't you say so? Then I won't write my exam! That's not what I meant. You always misunderstand. I misunderstand? Always? You keep interrupting my study. And my exams are on Monday! You run out of turmeric, oil... Can't you ask me to get them all at once? I won't go out after this. - - Fine, then I'll go. A young lad will sit at home like a king... and the old mother will work like a slave! Now you're getting it wrong. Did I say I won't go? Have I ever refused? Your brother never shouted at me. Sure! He's your blue-eyed boy! Who couldn't find a job in Calcutta! Give me the match box.- - Can't!! Your father's run out of catechu. Don't always compare me to Dada(brother)! It irritates me! Who is it? Is Mr. Subir Banerjee home? Yes? What is it? Are you "Pather Panchali's" Apu? No. There's a letter for you. It's important. What letter? Sir, I'm... from the Satyajit Ray Film and Television Institute. For Apu, of Pather Panchali... Listen my boy... I have nothing to do with either Satyajit Ray or Apu. Don't disturb me. Go. Take it easy! Careful! Make way, please!! He fell down. Just met him this morning. He was fine. Careful! He's an aged man. Mr. Banerjee! Can you hear me? Open his socks. Yes. Please move aside. Kanak has gone to get Dr. Mitra. Are you in pain? He had a black-out at the rickshaw stand. Father! Looks like it's a stroke.- - A heart problem? Heart attack?- - Everyone makes the same mistake. A heart attack is different. And a stroke...- Please keep quiet. Let the doctor come. Please stand outside.- - Sure, my boy. Prashanta, let's go outside. Must be hurting a lot? Bunty, open the windows. Yes. Father? Father?! Sir...- - Cut them smaller. Sure. Throw the gills away. You don't understand the gravity of the matter, Sir! They've sent you a letter from Germany. The Ministry sent it to SRFTI... so that they can locate Subir Banerjee... and deliver this letter to him. There are thousands by that name in Kolkata. Done? The bag please.- - Here. No, this one is for you. This is your letter, sir! The child actor, Apu, in "Pather Panchali". It is for Subir Banerjee, Sir. The Dean has given me this responsibility. Take a look... I'm not interested. I have no connection with cinema now. Tell them he couldn't be found. 'Tribal folk song' That's it. Very good. Slow down a little more and then be steady. Okay? You were very good. Just don't look at the camera. Okay then? Everyone ready? Camera up! A little more. Up!- - Silence everyone! Start sound. Rolling. Roll camera.- - Rolling. Clap!- - 28/1, Take 1! Action! Excuse me. Hey cut it! Is this a circus? Take him away! Can't you see a shoot's going on! Get out! Let go. I'll leave.- - Yes, please do! Crane up!- - Silence! Out! Get out of here! Yes, I'm going! Disturbing the shoot!- - Silence! Ready? Start sound.- - Rolling. Roll camera!- - Rolling. Clap! Action! Give it to me.- - Oh no, please. Don't refuse, give it to me. Wouldn't I take it if you were my dad? So? Wait. Listen... I'm not going to receive that letter. Fine. The German Government's choice... for the most celebrated child character... is Apu. So they want to bring the child actor over... to felicitate him. When Pather Panchali turned fifty... Pt. Ravi Shankar too was felicitated by them. They want Subir Banerjee in Germany. You are 'Apu' to them, Uncle. What do I have to do?- - Nothing. Just read the letter and give me a letter of consent. Uncle... I'll take care of everything. You only need to sign on your letter-head. You do have a letter-head? Never needed one in my job. Will you finish by today?- - Yes. "The Bicycle Thieves" kid, Enzo Staiola... He was a Maths teacher at an ordinary school in Italy. Retired a few years ago. Even he doesn't have any connection with cinema now. And the child in "E.T."... He grew up to be a guitarist in a band. Then "Joy Baba Felunath's" Captain Spark. Jit Bose. Only one film. He's a top boss in a huge Bengaluru hotel. No one asks about them! The child in "The Kid". Where is he? Lost! You're not alone Uncle. Did cinema never attract you? For days Baba(Father)... lay paralysed in bed. Forget acting... I never even felt like watching films. This cannot go on, you know... There's a patient at home. Then there's housework. How's Aunt supposed to manage? Move aside. Our relative... The girl's from Burdwan. Good girl... educated. She's from a village, but... she's from a respected family. Well-groomed. Are you listening? Ashima. A Brahmin... though class divisions don't matter to you... Should I get her photograph and bio-data? Bio-data?? A job indeed! Why don't you take a look at the photograph? Give it a try. Bachchan Singh's hotel on Rashbehari Avenue? Bachchan Singh was a taxi-driver back then. He was to take me to Boral for the shoot everyday. He always came on time. After Kakababu's(Ray) work got over... Do sit down... After the shoot, he would drop me home on time. Here. Later... Father would often let me go alone. After all, Sardarji(Singh) was there! A father figure... You'd go alone? Yes. Dada(brother) too was young. Sometimes he'd visit during vacations. Four years of shooting! Four years! When money came, the shoot would resume. And when money got over, the shoot was stopped. Kakababu(Ray) took a lot of pains to make the film. Even I barely got anything. But... When Father... visited sometimes, I saw... Kakababu(Ray)... hand him a white envelope. I've held those envelopes against the sun. There'd be a hundred rupee note inside! Why don't you read the letter carefully to see... what exactly are they giving me? As in? See if they're giving some money as well. Babu(Son)!! Come quickly! Something's wrong with your father! The phone line is dead! Call Dr. Dutta immediately!! Apu! Apu get up! Get some water from the river(Ganges). Here! Take the mug. Get it quickly! New utensils for old clothes! New utensils for old clothes! Apu? He's on his way! Lord Shiva shall save us! Hail Lord Shiva! I'm sorry. What happened? What's happened?!! Shambhu, finish it and send it today. Okay. Meet me after work today. Okay. All okay?- - Yes sir. Good. Father's funeral is on the 12th. And then there's the fast-breaking ceremony. It's not really an invitation... Do come. After everything is over, I... say around the 17th... shall join work again. It's good to see... that despite being a boy of this generation... you are dutifully following all traditional rituals. Will you be shaving your head? You're shaving your head, surely? Half-communist? Who's name is this? Brother's. He's performing all rituals. There's one other thing, Dulal Babu... This factory, the machines, the noise... This environment isn't for me. Do give me some other reponsibility. If there's a vacancy in the Dharamtala office. I could appear for all necessary examinations. Finish your responsibilities as a son before that. How's your mother doing? Fine. I must go. Long Live Revolution! Long Live Revolution! Hurry up! Into the car! Come on! Revolution, huh? Come on! Get into the car!! They'd often ask me to join them. 'Subir, come when you have some time.' 'We need to talk...' About what? As always, brainwashing! Over here?- Jobless people. Useless. And what came of the revolt? Most of them... took up meaty jobs abroad. Pocketing fat salaries. That photograph of yours at Nemai Ghosh's house... It was natural that the police suspected you. I never bothered about the police. If I fell in front of them, I'd tell myself... "I'm not into all this. Why should I be scared?" That's it. No more signatures. Arko... You're doing so much to send me to Germany... What are you getting out of it? Nothing. Telling myself that I'm working for Pather Panchali. How many of us get that chance? Oh.. Uncle, do you have a small photograph? Do you? Open your eyes. How many copies? How many? About ten. And four for the VISA. Okay.- - Why so many? Keep them. Yes, keep them. The rates are low. Oh. When will you deliver them?- - Since these are digital... You'll get them right away. In ten minutes. Oh! Don't you ever have classes in SRFTI? Of course. You are always around me... Aren't you losing out on studies? There's still time Arko. Let me be. I've aged. I'm adjusted to a certain lifestyle. The crowds, the press, photographers... and this foreign trip. I'm nervous. Do you have a passport? Why? I do. You bunk classes anyway. A few more days won't matter. They did say they'll give me an escort! The light.- - Sorry. The groom's arrived! Come, see! Greetings! Welcome, Subir! Move aside. [Chants] Om Swasti. Om Swasti. Don't you have her photograph? Mrs. Ashima Banerjee's? No. How much is the tailoring charge for the suit? Along with the material... about 6000.- - God! I'll go bankrupt! Impossible. How cold will it be in Germany? 8 to 10 degrees(Celcius). I'll wear double sweaters. Come in. Uncle... Before you leave... how about meeting Satyajit Ray's family once? They'd be happy. No way. There's no need to overdo this. If I were you... I'd have a press conference. You're being given such a coveted award. Shouldn't people know? Look... Are you going to come up with new ideas everyday? Did the organizers bother to inform them? No. Then why should I... Listen... If we can do this under wraps, good. Or else... Fine. May I... open the window please? My eyes are smarting. I sprayed pesticides the other day. Open it. This room is never opened. You insisted, so... Which direction is this? South. Where are you lost? Where have I seen these drapes? Try and remember. You know? Where? At Uncle's house? No. In this house itself. In this house?? Yes my dear. On me. A sari from my wedding. Don't you remember? It got stuck to a nail and tore. So, I made curtains. Nice! Recycle. No! Not on a cycle! On a rickshaw! A rickshaw?- - What's wrong with you! The door's open!- - Ma won't come now. What if someone else arrives? I do want someone to arrive, but no one seems to! It's time we offered prayers. What? I forgot!- - What? Move! What's that? Father came on Wednesday. He brought this. A charm from Goddess Kali's temple. Very effective. Nothing can touch you if you wear it. Not even you? Go and bathe. Then I can put this on you. Your father... put a charm on me. That's effective too! Go bathe. And yes... On the 28th you are specially invited to our home. Don't forget. Go along. Why are you staring? Am I your new bride? Only one. You promised. After meals. You missed my little boy's rice-eating ceremony, so... Mother is a bit... Do explain to her. Is that why she didn't send the car to the station? Mother's not like that. Byangoma's not working. Who is 'Byangoma'??- - The Austin car. He is 'the noisy fairy-tale bird'! The clutch needs repair. He's an old car... You know, Byangoma had a wife! Byangomi. The red car. Chrysler. She stopped working six years back. After we sold it, Father didn't eat for two days. Saying, "If I break my bones, you'll sell me off as junk too!" Dada(Brother)... Father was saying, Tunu's turned out to be very fair! Now who's 'Tunu'?? Brother's younger one. Runu is older. Runu, Tunu. Oh. He's very naughty! He's always running around! Always chattering away! And if you stop him, he'll sing songs... recite rhymes. Please don't hurry back this time, Subir. It's been long since you visited. Hey wait! Stop here. What happened? What is it?? Come here. What is it?? Come with me. What?- - Shhhh! Listen! This is where our house was. And this is the cracked wall. This is all that's left. This is where our door was. Here. This tree. That scene where a raindrop falls on that bald man's head? With the rains approaching?- - Yes! That scene was shot here. Under this very tree! Over here... Bansi(Ray's Art Director) had put up a cow-shed. And this is that window! My sister dying... A roaring storm outside... Jute curtains fluttering in the wind. On this shelf was hidden, the necklace that she had stolen. The tulsi shrine. Back then the shrine seemed very high. This was Aunt's corner. Indir Thakuran's shack. Kakababu(Ray) himself had planted this hibiscus tree. The plant was tiny then! This is where Pishima(Aunt) would wash her hands. Jatin! Call your master immediately! What's wrong, Jatin?- - Sister's had a fall. Jatin's gone to get the doctor. Lives nearby, will reach soon. Okay. What happened, my dear?- - It was all so sudden! I was startled when I heard the sound from downstairs! Don't worry. She'll be fine. Move aside. Let me see. What happened Kali?- - What else? She's been travelling all day. Probably exhaustion. So grandson-in-law? I've been noticing for two years... You're not taking care of Kali at all. Why else would she fall? You're at it again? Don't mind, Subir. Aunt is poking fun at you. A grandson-in-law after all! She can't resist teasing you. Not fever. I'm better now, Grandma. Quiet! Please come. Give me the bag. Sure. So, Aunt? You're the doctor now? My dear, open your mouth. Let me give you a painkiller. In case you've hurt yourself. No, she did not fall. The tea-tray fell. She grabbed the rails and sat down. Please come. What's wrong with our girl? Is Calcutta not suiting her? Of course it is! She's been fine in Calcutta- - Aunt, let her go now. Doctor's here. Sit.- - Let's see what's wrong. I don't know what you will say Upen, but my diagnosis is... Kali is pregnant. Oh Aunt! Let him examine her! Upen, I've administered some Arnica. Okay. Uncle... Do you know what this is? What is that? A brick from that house in Boral. I picked it up quietly! What use is it of? This is history, Uncle! A brick from the house in 'Pather Panchali'. Did you bring some hibiscus as well? No. Here. Try this. Turn around a little more. And then? Was Grandma right? Unbelievable power! She had only checked the pulse. Then the inevitable happened... They kept their daughter back. An affluent family... They'd take good care of her... She'd be happy among her own people. Here she had to work very hard. She had to manage everything alone. Good. Perfect fit! This one's last. Try it once. That's enough. Don't overdo it. Two is enough. You shouldn't have brought these coats. What if your father needs them? He won't. 7th March. Cardiac arrest. Wear this. Turn around. Let me see. Perfect! And then? You left her back at her father's? I'll leave.- - God bless. I'll take your leave.- - Yes, my son. Grandma, come inside. Bye then? Listen! Mother's right hand is hurting. Please break the coal for her. Get her some fuel too if you can. Okay. And... We owe the waterman 3 rupees. He's very clever. He'll ask for more. Don't you pay! And listen... Cigarettes... Don't smoke too much! And yes! When you dry clothes on the rooftop, turn them inside out. Or else they'll bleach. Okay. See you then? See you. Won't you visit me sometimes? Why won't I? Keya was saying she knows a good cook. Try and engage her. Don't eat junk food. Subhash.- Yes. Don't delay. It's time for the train. You must leave. Seat him on the train before you come away. Don't forget to give Mother her sari. And water the plants everyday. What's this? Only one? Don't you drink? Do you? Yes. Sometimes. How old are you? 26. Why? Just asked. My friends even smoke herbs. I don't. Don't ever touch them! They'll destroy you. At your age, even I... succumbed to peer pressure... specially during festivals... and tasted them. I think I saw about three hundred bottles under the staircase. Yes, it's time to sell them. Did you mind? At that time... I had left Ashima behind. 7-8 months. I was alone. Sudhanshu, Benu, Moloy... my friends, would often come over. That was when I took to it. Leaving Ashima behind may have been easy... but staying without her was not easy at all. And think about my age back then. What more? That's all for today. And sorry for the spelling mistakes. I know you'll laugh. Laugh if you like! I'm not a writer, am I? This is good enough for a letter. Take care of yourself, my dearest. I am keeping well... but I'll feel better when you come. You will come, won't you? If you don't, you're not my friend. Arko, this is the last one. You must go home. This is bad. Why bad? The world's most celebrated child character is Apu. You are that actor. No one knows... That the man... has taken a... a forced retirement... lives on a meagre house rent and pension now. Is this not bad? Go home, my child. Do you know what time it is? Uncle... What if I don't go? I mean, do you mind if I... stay here tonight? Your mother will worry. I'll call her. I often stay out with friends. At their homes... at the hostel. She is used to it. But it's okay... I mean... If you don't want me to stay... I'll leave. Did I say that? Thanks. I should call Mother. Irony sir. Irony. Father had dreams, you know... to go abroad. He couldn't make it. At least Father's outfits are going abroad. And that too, to Germany. Father used to say... "Your work may not reach a destination... But your intentions should." What do you think Moloy? I'm not very hopeful. What do you mean by that? Her father's also not saying anything clearly. A premature baby... And there are respiratory problems. Jaundice has set in too. Won't survive? We're doing our best. Thus, the incubator. Repeat. Listen... you... be honest. Do I need to worry about Ashima?- No. She's fine. Physically fine. But they are not giving her the baby. Everyone's saying the same thing. Should we shift her? To a better nursing home? That won't help. What do you mean? Dr. Dawn has told me clearly, "I'm trying my best Moloy." Prepare yourself. What nonsense! Subir. Red Salute to the first Leftist Government in West Bengal! Red Salute to the first Leftist Government in West Bengal! Red Salute! Red Salute! Red! Red! Red Salute! Red Salute! Red Salute! The people who conduct the VISA interview... are they all Germans? How would I know? Why are you worked up since morning? Are you going there of your own will, on a holiday? They have called you. You're an invited guest! Have confidence! I've arranged all your documents. You'll have no problem. [Interview in German] Do you know how they say 'Good Morning'? 'Gu-ten Mor-gen!' Gu-ten Mor-gen. Mr. Subir Banerjee. Come. And listen, don't need to say 'Gu-ten' and all that. Don't speak more than what's necessary. Come. Go that way. Look, Dr. Dawn... is one of the best doctors in Calcutta. The nurses say you're not eating... You're not eating at all... how can you carry on like this? You must rest faith in God. What's wrong, Ashima? Ashima? Why don't they give me the baby just once? How will they, unless the jaundice is cured? For the baby... from today... err... a separate... a special incubator has been arranged. See, Ashima, to me you are very... you're very important. The fact that you're alright... Your health is the most...- - Liars! All of you are lying! Just once... let me see my baby just once. I want to go once! Just once! Ashima! Come on! Can't you let me go just once? I shall go!- - Don't get up Ashima! Your stitches have not healed yet! - I must go!! The stitches haven't healed yet! What are you doing! Let me go! I want to go!- - Listen to me, honey. Nurse!! Listen to me once! Please leave. We'll take care of her. Calm down. You will surely see your baby. Your baby will be given to you. Calm down. You mustn't get excited. We just saw the baby. Didn't we? The child is healthy, happy... You'll see your baby! Calm down please... You need to get well for your baby. Her pressure needs to be checked. And call the doctor. Sir? I heard from Moloy... Aren't you Apu from 'Pather Panchali'? May I have an autograph please?- Who's Apu? I'm not Apu! You're wrong! Nonsense! Once you come back from Germany... I'll make a documentary on you. It'll be an honest documentation. In what way? It'll show that you are... an introvert. A little lazy. Short-tempered. Miserly. Miserly? I've been compromising on my work for days to help in yours. Even the VISA is through. Have you ever given me a treat? What would you have me treat you to? I'm not inviting myself! Tell me... What other flaws did you see in me? The mention of 'Apu' makes you angry. Or rather, it irritates you. But... deep inside... you quite enjoy this glory. Anything else? Tell me frankly, Uncle... If Apu weren't there, would this day have come? Do you know what upsets me about Apu? That fellow never left me all my life. He stuck to me like a shadow. It's very uncanny. Let's go. Get ready. The baby is no more. You've been doing all the asking. Aren't you excited... that you're going to Germany? I am. More so, because I am taking Apu with me. You know they sell brick pieces from the Berlin wall as mementos there. However costly they might be, I'll surely buy one. And then I'll keep it beside the brick I got from Boral. Apu in Germany! I'm the only witness! Slow down the car please! What's wrong?- - Pull over, please! Let this one pass. What's wrong, Uncle? A disgusting ritual! Which one? Didn't you just see? Staining the feet in crimson... for impression on paper. Morbid! Sorry. No, I understand. Let's go now. Come on. Finish this quickly. This bank of the river, says with a sigh... "The other bank has all happiness, I find." This bank says, with a sigh so deep... "All joy rests, on the other bank I see." You will never understand women. This depression will get you nowhere. Listen... It's been 15 years of marriage. I still can't fathom what she thinks! How can you, in just 2 years? I would suggest... call her mother over from Burdwan. The girl is starving, bed-ridden. She doesn't speak. This can't go on! Her mother will be good for her. And you, in a way, are lucky. So many women die during delivery. Your wife is healthy! And she's still young.. Talk to her, plan another baby. Only if she'd be willing to listen! She doesn't say a word. Doctors say she's going through a 'depression'. Even my words have no effect on her. Subir, the Boss would like to see you. Me?- - Yes. Subir... Dulal is in a good mood. Try and get a week's leave sanctioned. Then go for a holiday. You'll both feel better. I'll try. I'll be right there. Yes, tell me. Oh. Hello. Yes, tell me. What! Bad news? Subir? I must go... home. How did it happen? She did it herself. The baby took Ashima away from me. Come. Is it still burning? No blisters, though. Mother applied an ointment. Can't you be a little more careful? The handle of the oven came off. What could I have done? Everyone in the neighbourhood has cooking gas. Even Bubai has one. You say you love me... but you don't buy me cooking gas. I will. Oh yes! When I get the Puja bonus... the first thing I'll buy is cooking gas. Let me see your hand. No, let it be. Not while you're eating. Your office isn't dependable. Increments are rare. They've promised a raise. They've been saying that for ages! But you still can't come home before 7 pm! Tell me... Did you lie to me? That your typing speed's gone up from 30 to 70? Yes, that's true. Come to my office and see for yourself. It'll be proved. Not 70. I'll make it 80 now. Then why do you come home at 7 pm everyday? What do you mean? When the speed was 30, you'd come at 7 pm. Now its 70, but you still come at 7 pm. God knows how! Here. What is it! No... err..- Move!! Subir! I think we should take her down. It's time. Lift that side up! Be careful! Kakababu(Ray)... had sent somebody for me... when he was casting for 'Aparajito'. My age was just right. And the boy who got the role... Pinaki? His age was also perfect. But... the image of Apu that Kakababu(Ray) had in mind... Pinaki fit into that. And so I couldn't be a part of 'Aparajito'. Didn't it hurt? Can't really remember. Often... one thought would haunt me... I was made to part ways with Apu... but did Apu and I part ways at all? The script of the Apu Trilogy... seemed to have been written for me. Mr. Banerjee. Please come.- - Yes. Your son? Let's go. Come. Your entire life lies ahead, my child. This way... You can't go on brooding like this. You're not taking calls from friends. You even misbehaved with Alok yesterday. Her photograph... the crimson imprint of her feet... The more you keep looking at them... the more you grieve. Start afresh. Her clothes, jewellery, all her belongings... return them all to her family. What? Heard what I said? Can any mother... bear this... day in and day out? Please check everything Subhash. Everything is in the suitcase. How can everything be there, Subir? Subhash, please check the jewellery. There. Mother passed away within two months of Kali's death. We thought it better not to inform you. I'll take your leave. Why grandson? How can you go without having lunch? And where will you go? Go take a bath. I'll serve you lunch. What are you staring at? Take him along! Yes. Brother-in-law, please come with me. Go, my boy. Thank you. For what? What did I do? Thanks to Subir Banerjee... I'm flying Business Class. In that case... I need to thank Apu. Why? It's because of that little fellow... that I'm taking my first flight ever. Oh! This is your first time? Nice! [chants] Hey... Is your name Apu? Tunu!
