So what is the point of knowing how I am doing? No, I mean.. I needed some help from you. Can you fill this form of mine? I see. English? You cannot understand it, right? So what will you do in the foreign country if you don't know English? No, no. I mean I know English. Actually the matter is that I have hurt my hand. I have a lot of pain. I cannot hold a pen. - I see. That is why I needed some help from you. Give it. No problem. Actually what happened is that when I was traveling by bus.. ..a boy was teasing a girl. When I see all this, I cannot control myself. I punched him hard on his face. He ducked down and I hit the rod instead. Is the girl related to you? Is the girl related to you? No. Then why did you want to hit him? What is the name? I didn't ask her. She got down at the next stop. Your name. What is your name? Everyone in the colony calls me Madu with love. You can write that too.. - No one here is in love with you. Tell me the name that is written in your certificate. I don't have a certificate. Forget about a name on that. What happened? It takes so long to tell your name? Yes. Madhusudan Dutta. Yes. Madhusudan Dutta. Father is Vibhuti Bose. And mother is Asha. The whole family is made of writers. Wonder if he is getting his form filled or horoscope written. Brother. I am Madan Das. - I am Kali Das. Can you help me? Please. What help do you need? Can you fill my form? I will take rupees 500. How much? 500. Wouldn't 100 do? Okay. 400. Just because I am in a desperate condition, you are saying this? I will give 200. Last is 350. Okay. - Yes. Consider me as your brother and take 250. Oh God. Your hands are shaking to give 250 to me. What shall I do? Till now, I was in the habit of begging and taking money. I didn't have the habit of giving anything. This is the first time. That is why my hands are shaking. Okay. Give it. - Oh no. Form? Oh yes. There she is. Your sister-in-law is filling the form of someone there. Go and ask her to do it for you. Thank you, brother. - Brother Kali. Here you are. Sign it here. - Okay. I will sign it outside. What should I say to you.. - Let it be. No need to say anything. Are you blind? Can't you watch it while walking? Don't be rude and talk politely. Or else, I will give you one.. - What will you give? I will plant. I will plant a flag in front of the house. The people of your house wouldn't be able to go out Hey, you slapped me so hard? Hey, you have an injured hand, right? And it is paining a lot? You cannot hold a pen. It hurts when I am about to write. Not when I have to thrash. Get lost. He has slapped me twice? Where are you going? Earlier, you gave the responsibility of an old woman to me. And that took away half a liter of my petrol. I gave 250 outside for you to fill my form. You are leaving without doing that? Who did you give 250 to? Why? That man is standing there. Your agent. -What? Hey.. - Idiot! Three slaps on the cheeks of Madan Das? Just because I don't have the means.. ..everyone is thrashing me. Oh my God. It seems like a photo to me. I am sure it is my photo. He is darling son. My darling son. "Bipasha." Oh my God. Hey, come here and see this. My son has got into a relationship with some girl. I am worried about the girl. Let me see. Which girl has he ruined? Let me see. "Bipasha." Hey, she is our Bipasha. - Who is that? Bipasha Basu. Hey, is she the thin daughter of Nagen Basu from the other colony? She wears small clothes and roams around the whole country? Hey, no. She is a film star. How did you know? - Hey.. I saw her on T.V. You told me that you watch religious channels on T.V all day. Now.. - I got it. You watch religious channels all day. And when I am asleep, you watch lowly channels. That is what I was wondering about. My son isn't like this. You have got this picture. No. The son has committed a mistake and I have to suffer the result. Even God would have to suffer if he is with you. She is too much! Disgusting. He is doing all this at such an old age? What should I tell the girl? She is taking such weird clothes. What are you doing, mother? Why are you taking out my jeans and tops? Look, father. Will you wear all this when you go abroad? Mother. Everyone there wears all this. Let everyone wear whatever they want to wear. But you won't. Always wear Salwar Kameez and cover your head with a veil. So that people can understand... on seeing you that you haven't gone to Canada to study. But to choose a husband. Okay? - Perfect. You can only take a Bangladesh flight instead of Canada flight. Are you laughing? Because of you, the girl is going out of our control. What is the need to go abroad and study? Aren't there good schools and colleges here? Apart from that, only ten months are left for her marriage. Mother. The one I am getting married to doesn't have a problem if I go abroad. Why are you getting worried without a reason? Look, it is a matter of seven to eight months. It isn't mean feat to get a diploma from such a famous institute. And apart from that, you will gain if Ria becomes a fashion designer. You are the one that says your blouses are loose. And they don't fit well. Do it. Do it. Father and daughter can make fun of me. But do remember something. If you go there and complain to me.. ..that the food isn't good or the accommodation isn't good.. ..I will not listen to anything. I will get you back immediately. Mother. Nothing of that sort will happen. I will complete the course and return. And apart from that, Canada is a very cultured country. Only cultured people go there. Come on. Come on. Get down.. -Come down. Get down. Father. I am leaving, father. - Go carefully. Brother, don't forget us when you go abroad. Hey, give me the garland. - Hey, no way. Never ever. -Here you are. Are we getting late? Look, you are wearing a garland made of orange flowers. But while coming back, wear a garland made of fragrant, white flowers. And as a couple. Listen. Do offer veneration to Lord on my behalf. - Yes. Do tell the Lord that the garland should be made of pearls. A monkey will wear a garland made of pearls. It will shine. Hey, keep quiet now. Father. Father! - Madna. Father, don't worry. Your son will do something for sure in Canada. I will get married to a girl from there. And I will start a business right there. I love you, Madna. - I love you, father. I love you. - I love you, father. I miss you.. - Father, leave me. I miss you.. - Father, let go. Leave me. The flight for Canada will leave. - What? I am leaving, father. - Yes. I have arranged for a menu for nice food for you. - Manu? Hey, not Manu. Recipe. Recipe. I see. - Look. Hey, this is the rose dessert. This is Sutapa Rai's vegetable dish. This is Sanjeev Kapoor's fish fried rice. Sadhna Mukhopadhya's raw banana dish. Wow. - There is more. This is sweet. Look. Sweets from Balram. Deshbandhu Mishtan Bhandar.. - That is it. That is it. That is it. That is it. That is enough. This will be more than enough to impress prospective in-laws. Oh yes. Good point. When you go inside, be aware of your surrounding. Who knows? You might get a Canadian girl inside the airport itself. That is it! You will have someone ready for you on your way there. There is one. Madhu. I think your destiny will change right here. Give me two cups of coffee. Rupees 200. How much? 200? Yes, sir. But it is sold for rupees 10 at Banipur. So you should have taken the flight from Banipur. Hey, you will sit in the airport all your life and sell tea and coffee. You will never be able to go to Canada ever in life. Now take this. Come on. Greeting. How sweet! Greeting. How did you know I am sweet? I came back to Kolkata after many years in Canada. And since the time I have come here.. ..I have heard only hi or hello as greetings. - Yes. Kolkata has become like Canada. I have heard this sweet word from you for the first time. Great. What do you mean by 'after many years'? You have been staying in Canada since a long time? Yes, of course. Oh, very good. I am going to Canada for the first time. We will go together. Okay? - Yes, yes. Here you are. Here you are. Have tea for this celebration. Take it. Take it. - Hey, hey, hey. Leave tea. Have coffee. Greetings.. - Hey, hey, hey. What are you doing here? I am going to Canada. I haven't come to jump around in the airport like you. What? - Coffee. Hey, even Madan is going to Canada. Yes. Keep it in the pocket. What is your seat number? Yes. I am telling you. - Hey. Why would she tell you? She will tell me if she has to. I am always with people. So stay with people. What are you doing here? If you talk too much with this coffee.. ..I will give you.. - Hey. What will you give? Yes? What will you give? I will get you punished. Security. Security. Security. Come here.. - One minute. One minute. One minute. There is no need to call anyone. I will have the coffee. - Yes. And the tea.. - Yes? Will be consumed by my son! Son? Yes. That is my son. Hey, are you married? Yes, of course. Is he your.. No, no, no. My husband is a software engineer in Canada. - I see. Okay. Have tea. -What? One mustn't have too much of coffee after marriage. Got it? - Meaning? Give me the tea. - Too much! Let the small kid have tea at the expense of his father. Okay? If he has tea at the expense of uncles at this age.. ..he will have a lot of expenses in the future... ..and you would have to find a lot of uncles. Right? She is too much. - Strange. Sorry, sir. I cannot take the tea back. Why? Why cannot you take it back? It is just as you had given it. I haven't even tasted it. I took it for a girl. But I heard she is married. I took it for no reason. I am telling you. Give me rupees 80 back. Or else, you will be in a problem. Okay? If I call my people, 20 to 25 boys will come just like that. They will come here and teach you a good lesson. Okay? Even the plane wouldn't fly in the sky. The plane will fly for sure. Let me see if you can fly too. Come on, Madhusudan Dutta. I have to look for another Canadian girl. Come inside. Morning. - Morning. I am going to Canada. Canada! Your passport and boarding pass. Boss. I have everything. I have everything. I have kept it together. What? I had kept it in the pocket. Where did it go? Go back or come to the side. Hey.. - Please. Hey, it was there. If I didn't have it, why would I come inside? To clean the place? You cannot go inside without passport. You speak rubbish! Hey, if I call my people here.. ..you will get into trouble right here. The plane wouldn't fly in the air. Keep quiet. You dared to slap Madan Das? You dared to slap Madan Das twice? We still have support. I will rebel right away. "We shall overcome." - Get lost! Listen. Can you move the bag? My hand is injured. I am in a lot of pain. Actually what happened is that while coming by bus.. ..a boy was teasing a girl. And you cannot tolerate all that. You wanted to punch that boy. But he ducked his head. And you hit the rod instead. You can say whatever you want. - Hey. I don't really mind about that. From right now, you and I will be together. As you and I are going to Canada. It is a journey of 20 hours.. - Oh no. If both of us are together.. ..we can spend the time nicely. Got it? Just keep in mind that the people make the allowancecement properly. Not allowancement. Announcement. Whatever it is. We must hear it. Just be careful. Go to hell. Hey, where are you going? Forget about 20 hours. One cannot be with you even for 20 seconds. Idiot! Get lost. Hey, at the end, you had to sit next to me. Right? This is called destiny's collection. Not collection. Connection. Oh no, whatever it is. It is already made. That is why I was saying that without knowing anything.. ..one shouldn't give a step pant. - Not step pant. Statement. One shouldn't give it. Oh no. How will I sit with him? I will go mad. Yes, ma'am. Excuse me. Can you please change my seat? Sorry, ma'am. All the seats are occupied. I see. Anything else? - No. Thank you. What did she say? When will we reach? Oh God. I am talking to you so that we can cover the long journey easily. And you are wearing this in your ears? Hey, get lost. - Hey! Hey, a Bengali hit another Bengali in the plane? Okay. Don't talk to me if you don't feel like talking to me. Even I have no wish to talk to you. Now I will put oil in my nose and sleep. Hey.. - Hey, you.. Ask them if oil is available. Get lost. Get lost. Too much! Daddy. - Daddy. Can we kiss, baby? Oh sure, darling. Hey, hey.. -Hey, hey! What are you doing? Oh God, where did you come from? I was kissing my Canadian wife. Trying to act smart, right? Do you think I don't know about your intentions? Since the time you have come, you have been chasing me around. What? I have been chasing you around? Listen, if I have to chase, I will chase a Canadian girl. I will not chase a rural girl like you. What did you call me? -Rural. Have you seen yourself in the mirror? You monkey! The plane will be shortly landing at Vancouver international airport. Passengers are requested to fasten their seat belts. Close the tray tables. And keep the seats upright. She is speaking such impeccable English. I am sure she stays in Canada. Hope you enjoyed the flight. We will be reaching Canada soon. Canada? Yes, sir? -What? How can I help you? - Have we reached Canada? Yes, sir. Can you open my belt? Sorry, sir. No, fine. So? It is settled. We will meet again. Thank God we were together. The time just flew by and we didn't even come to know. We flew in a jiffy and landed in a jiffy. This was the longest and the worst journey of my life. Oh my God. The rural girl has stepped on foreign soil.. And has started speaking in English. She is speaking fluent English. You are crossing your limit. Hey.. - Give me the phone. The phone.. -From the front? Where does one click a picture? Give me the phone.. - Yes. Here you are. Your mobile has my picture. Show my picture to a girl who has a ration card of this country. Tell them that I am nice boy. And if she gets married to me, her life will be bliss. Any girl will do. And if you think everything is right.. ..do finalize the alliance. Hey, only a Bengali can take care of another Bengali in an unknown land. What do you say? Sure. I will show your picture and warn each and every girl. They shouldn't get into a relation with this boy even by mistake. Or else, her life will turn into hell. Here you are. Bengalis are the same in Kolkata and Canada too. A Bengali will never lose his habit of bothering others. Rural girl. - Monkey! You have saved me. I don't want to meet this girl ever again. She might come to my wedding altar anytime and break off my marriage. Oh God. Thank you for doing away with this trouble. I don't want to meet him ever again. Or else, I will go mad. Oh my God. "I am crazy. I am going." "To look for her. With a lot of love." "I am crazy. I am going." "To look for her." Oh no. Hello. Kali here. Have you reached abroad? Listen. Tell me. Did you impress a girl yet? No. The one I got is from our country. She is not original. Only with a stamp of Canada. But I have my ears and eyes open. I will impress one for sure. Watch where you are going, idiot! Wish you the same. Hey. Who are you speaking to in English? What? Now.. Look. I have kept someone for doing the chores. I have kept help. What? You have employed a foreigner as help? So would I have a person from our country to help me.. ..if not a foreigner in Canada? Hang up now. I am in a foreign country. My bill is shooting up. What? One can get help on contractual basis even in Canada? Why did he employ a foreigner as help? He could have taken one of us. I have heard the help there don't talk in any language except English. And they don't walk around or move except in their own cars And do you know? The cleaners there come in their own cars.. ..and clean the toilets and give a bill and leave. Why wouldn't they drive cars? Whatever we earn in one month is their earning per hour. What? - Yes. Hara Parbati Rannaghar. Yes. The address is correct. But it shows two boards here. Oh no. Before the fighter woman poaches him.. ..I have to get him inside. So let me go. I will go inside and ask. Hail Lord. - Hail Lord. Brother. Tell me. Is this Hara Parbati Rannaghar? It is right. If you have to eat good Bengali food.. ..Hara Parbati Ranna ghar is the place to come to. The dish starts with the vegetable dish and ends with mango chutney. When you wash your hands, I make betel leaf with true tobacco. Welcome. - Yes. Hey, Bhola. A family member has come from our country. Give him some drink. Family? I saw you today. And you turned me into a family member right now? Every Bengali here is a family member of mine. Do you love everyone, brother? Hey, it is the actual menu of Haranath. I don't do business for money. I do business for love. - Yes. Money is like dirt on the hand. Thanks to God's blessings, I am smeared with that dirt all over my body. What? - It snows a lot here in winter. That is why I don't bathe more than once a week. Now look at you. Even I am in the same condition, brother. It doesn't snow in Banipur but even I bathe only once in a week. What? - Yes. Tell me, family member. What will you have? Non-vegetarian or vegetarian? I am very hungry. Since the time I have taken the plane.. ..I have been having bread and feeling constipated. I told the girls to get some curry and rice for me. But they could only say sorry. I am a Bengali. If I don't eat some meat and rice.. ..will the system get cleared? Tell me. Don't talk about those girls, family member. They don't speak a word apart from what they have been taught in the training. Yes. When they come close, they say, yes, sir. And when we ask for something, they say, sorry, sir. Brother. Get some meat and rice for me. Sorry, sir. This isn't a plane, brother. Then why are you saying sorry? No, actually what has happened, family member.. We are not getting a proper supply of meat. That is why we have to serve soya bean. Yes. Say this to cheat everyone. Hey.. -Hey! Go and get a vegetarian dish. Everything is available in our vegetarian dish. Rice, pulses, vegetable. Chutney. Fries. Brother Hara. I wanted to ask if we could finalize before I ate. Now look at this. You have stepped here. Now the matter has been finalized because of that. What? You are my permanent family member. Hail Lord. Start eating. Pure Bengali dish. Eat. -Yes, eat. Eat. - Yes. What is the matter? It is three. But the boy hasn't come yet. Where did he go? Wow. Really, brother Hara. Your cooking is too good. Hey, this is nothing. 420. - Yes. Fool! What happened, family member? Was there something lacking in us as hosts? You used abusive language. Hey, not you. People curse Bengalis. About Bengalis changing when they go abroad. They should be taken by their ears and brought here and shown. Look. Bengalis do take care of Bengalis. Hey, I do as much as I can. Really, brother Hara. You are taking care of me like a father. I am forgetting my father's name in this condition. Don't be so emotional, family member. One minute. Oh my God, this is a call from you. Hey, it isn't my phone. It is your phone. Yes. The phone is mine. But the call is yours. Now look at you. How can I call on your phone? -Yes. I think you are still on the plane. And your head is feeling dizzy. But the number is of your hotel. Wait. Hello. Hello. Where are you? Parbati here. From Hara Parbati Ranna Ghar. Parbati? - Oh my God. Hello. Do bless me. Brother, forget about blessing you. It is three. Where are you? Oh my God. I have been sitting since a long time. Now here I am. I have had my meal. Now I am having betel. 420. What? Where? I cannot see you. What will happen now? - Now listen to me. Hey, I am here. I have to get rid of him before trouble comes here. Trust me. - Or else, we will not be forgiven. I am telling the truth. - Hey. I am right here. Sitting in Hara Parbati Ranna Ghar. Here he is. Brother Hara is standing here. What? Hara? Hey, that means you have fallen into the trap of a cheat. Cheat? Brother Hara? No, no, Parbati. You are making a mistake. Brother Hara is very simple. He treated me like his own son and made me eat food with so much of love. He gave me betel leaf number 420 to me. I think I have come to the hotel of my own father. Hey, get lost. May your father get ruined. Oh no. Five dollars. Five dollars? Why? Now you ate so much of food here. Oh God. You fed me with so much love like a father for his son. Why should I pay for that? You have to pay if you want love from a bachelor father. What? I have come to Canada to earn money. Not to spend it. I will not pay even a penny. Hey.. - That is great! This is a true Bengali's son. Don't give him even a torn note. Hey, who wants a torn note? I want a crisp note of five dollars. If you want to work at my hotel, don't give him even a penny. Hey, listen. - Go and close the door. How will he leave without paying up? I will decide about that. - Great, Bhola. Hey.. - Come on, fight. Hey, do you want to take money from me? Yes, I will.. - I will thrash you so hard that.. ..you and roasted chicken will look alike.. - I will thrash you hard. Get lost.. - Hey! Hey, don't hit him. - That is true. Don't hit him at all. I have taught a lesson to a lot of Bengalis here. If you don't pay five dollars... I will make you wash utensils for the rest of the week. Come on.. - Hey! Here you are. For you, money is like dirt on the body. Come on. Take it off my body. Come on, buddy. Don't mess with these cheats. - What is she saying? What? - I will give you a cleansing juice. Everything that you have eaten will come out. Come on. - Hey! Hey, hey, hey.. - What happened? Hey, get it. Get it. He will steal it. He is a big cheat. He went away. - He is a super cheat. You can only dominate me. When Parbati comes here, you shrink like a worm. Parbati? Haven't I told you? Don't take that name in front of me. Abani had given me rave reviews about you. Wouldn't he? He has taken a lakh to give a false certificate. What? What did you say? I mean, I cooked in the ceremony of last rites of the brother-in-law of Abani. I see. Everyone was happy after eating the meal. Everyone told me to cook for the ceremony of last rites of Abani too. So what can you cook? Whatever you ask me. Vegetables to chutney. And flat bread to fried rice. Everything. Just give me the order and turn around. And the dish will be ready. Wow. You seem like a different person from the exterior. But I cannot understand what you are really like. Test me. - Okay. I will give you the spices. Make bottle gourd for me. Bottle gourd? Haven't you heard of it? What? What are you saying it? Even kids of my colony can cook it. Every house has a dish like this. That is why, half of the boys in my colony are called as Potol(gourd). Okay. Mr. Potol. - What? The kitchen is that side. Unripe bananas dish. Chicken with two onions. Vegetable dish. And potato.. Oh no. Everything is here except the dish of bottle gourd. Now I will be in trouble. What should I do? I will call mother. Son has called me. From Canada. Hey, son, how are you? I am fine. I was missing you. Hence I called. Even I am missing you. Do you know, mother? As soon as I sit down to eat, I remember the dish of bottle gourd that you make. How do you make it? Tell me. Hey, son. Have you gone to Canada to make bottle gourd dish? No, no, I will not make it. I have kept an aunt to cook for me. She is a foreigner. And she doesn't know how to make that dish. I will teach her. My son has kept a foreigner to cook food. - Really? He will teach her to make bottle gourd dish to her. Hey, son. Tell aunt to wash the bottle gourd well. Isn't it great? Didn't I tell you even kids from my colony can make it? It has been made like kids. You need to make this better. Remain in my training. Everything will be fine. If you want to stay here, keep two things in mind like a pillar. Yes, tell me. None of the customers should go to the cheat's hotel. Don't worry. I will pull everyone and get them here. Yes. Great. - Tell me about pillar number two. We have to think of a way where the servant, Bhola, leaves him. And he has to sit idle in his hotel and kill flies. Keep the flies ready. I will make sure he goes away right away. Just give me a permanent job. Sure. - What? Just do something. Do away with the Kolkata Sim card. - Yes. I will give you a local sim card. - Yes. Or else, everything that you earn will be blown off in the phone usage. Great. Great. I knew it that you would do this for me. Hey, only a Bengali will take care of a Bengali in an unknown land. Go. Come on time tomorrow. Where will I go? -To your house. What? I have given you a job. Not a daughter where you can stay.. ..at my place as a live in son-in-law. When given a little, they want everything. He is too much. I am sure she has been cheated by a Bengali. Or else, she gave me a job. But not a place to stay? Let me go. I will have to find a place to stay. So Miss Ria? How do you like the house? It is good. And very close to my college as well. But isn't the rent a bit high? I mean isn't the rent a bit high? Six months rent weekly. And an advance rent of 4 months. Look, the offer is 1000 dollars. But since you are a student, I am offering it cheap. Okay. I will take it. So you will have to get the rent by evening. Or the house goes to someone else. No issues. I will withdraw the money and meet you. I will meet you in the evening then. - No problem. Thank you. Bye, bye. - Bye. Hey, hey.. - Get back. - Help! Help! I just have 160 dollars. I have to pay the man by evening. How will I arrange for so much of money? Crap. If I call at home, mother will ask me to come back right away. Let me find some other accommodation. Hi, I am Ria. I saw your ad in the paper. Hello, Ria. From which part of India are you? I am from Kolkata. Kolkata? Bengali? I see. So we can talk in Bengali. Do you know Bengali? Hey, even I am from Kolkata. I have studied in Presidency. I am a true Bengali. Oh God. I saw your name as Kathy in the ad and hence, didn't understand at all. I was Kathakali before marriage. Kathakali Basu. After I got married to Roger here.. ..my name was shortened to Kathy from Kathakali. I see. Roger passed away two years back. Now it is only me and this house of mine. Of course, Jennifer, daughter of Roger from his first marriage.. ..comes to meet me at times. Ma'am. Can you give me a room to stay here? I see. You got a bit delayed, Ria. I gave that space to someone on rent today. I see. My bad luck. No, no, wait. I can make an arrangement. If you want, you can share the space with that boy. He is the one I am talking about. - No, ma'am. I am not sure. I mean.. .. I don't know him at all. How would he be? I don't think there should be a problem. The boy is decent. "Bipasha." Yes. Come on, Bips. I have made space for you. I am sure you are wondering about my weirdness, right? I am looking for a Canadian wife and yet, I am in love with you. Hey, let me clear something, dear. I don't care who comes to my life. You will always remain in my life like you are right now. Excuse me. "Bipasha." - Yes, aunt. Sorry. I have forgotten your name. It is Madhusudan Dutta in the passport. But everyone calls me Madhu with love. But he isn't like Madhu(honey) at all. - What is this? He is like poison. Hey, rural girl? You are here? Oh God. So you both know each other? Then there is no problem. Both of you can share and stay here. Share? With a monkey like him? - What? If need be, I will sleep on the streets. - Do that. Or go back to Kolkata. -Go back. I will not stay a kilometer within where he is staying. Hey, get lost. It seems I have invited you. Ma'am. Let me warn you. You have given this place to a very lowly person. You will repent later. - Hey, rural girl. One mustn't give a statement like that without knowing a person. Not that! Statement! Yes, whatever it is. One mustn't give it. Now go. Go and look for another place. Go. Get lost. - Get lost. Listen. Hey, aunt. -Yes? Don't give me such lowly girls to stay with me. You can tell me if it is a local girl. Okay? Hey, rural girl. One minute. You mustn't jump and leave. Firstly, it is a foreign country. Secondly, you are alone. And thirdly, you don't have a place to stay. And then, it is very cold here. I know you don't like me at all. But yet, knowing there are so many problems.. ..can I leave you alone? Do something. Take this blanket. Wrap this up. And go and sleep in the park. Go. Don't say thank you. A Bengali will look after a Bengali in a foreign country, right? Monkey! Oh no. These times are not apt for people trying to do good. Indo Canadian marriage bureau. 125, main street, Vancouver. Shabari Williams. Life safety insurance. Let me do something in life. After that, I will think about safety. Let me write this as well. Hey, rural girl. What are you doing here? You were hiding in the bathroom all night, right? The way of escaping from paying rent. Don't talk rubbish. What rubbish did I say? You are staying in my house and answering back? Have you bought this place? You are a tenant and so am I. Tenant? Who kept you as one? Aunt.. - I. I did. You? She came very late at night yesterday. I couldn't tell you. I have some status in life. I have connections with very high profile people in the share market. How can I stay with just any lowly person? Hey. Who did you call as lowly? Calm down. Calm down. Okay. She is a girl who is alone. Where would she go? There are so many rooms. You can stay in one. And she can stay in one. It is your house. Everything will happen according to your wish. Apart from that, Bengalis have to take care of Bengalis in a foreign country. Or else, will Chinese look after us? Let it be. Don't try to act great. I have some conditions. Tell me. Tell me. First. Don't enter my room even by mistake. Now look at her. Don't I have my own room? Why would I enter your room? Go ahead. Don't drink and come home. She is talking like kids. Why would I drink outside and come home? I will drink at home. Right? In your own room. - Okay. Lext.. Not lext.. Anyway. Third. I will use the bathroom in the morning first. Oh my God. Is that so? Use it. I don't have a habit of waking up in the morning. Paper man and milk man wake up in the morning. I have some high tastes. Completely different style of landlord. When the Sun is high in the sky, I wake up. So landlord. -Yes? Do you have some conditions? I just have one condition. What is it? Tell me. Now.. When it rains in the night and there is lightening.. ..heroines of Hindi films hug the hero. She mustn't hug me and all. My body and my soul. I have saved everything for my true love. Hey, hello. If need be, I will hug an electric wire but not you. Get rid of these misconceptions. Or else, you will be in trouble. Did you see? She has started troubling me since the time she has come. How will she stay with me all my life? Hey, what rubbish are you saying? What rubbish are you saying? Oh my God. I cannot tolerate these two anymore. Listen. If you have to live in Canada.. ..stay peacefully with each other. Okay? You didn't get any girl? You have made her stick to me since the airport? I don't what was the evil moment when I met him at the airport. I have heard that your company is very famous, Mr. Banerjee. Canada girls are crazy about Mr. Banerjee. Yes. I have draped saris on so many white skinned girls.. ..and made them sit on the wedding altar. I have come to you with that hope. Just do me a favor. Just get me a girl who has a proper ration card. I will give you the fees. Okay, what kind of girl would you like? Used or unused? Meaning? No, look. If you need a divorcee or widow.. ..then it would be five hundred dollars. Otherwise, if she is unmarried, it would be 1500 dollars. Unmarried. Unmarried. Okay, fine. Keep this with me. - Okay. I will call you next week. Okay. Hello. I am from Indo Canadian marriage bureau. Mr. Banerjee here. Tell me. Oh my God. Even you are in the queue to get married? Wait. I will teach you a lesson. These boys are from rich families. What can I say? Come and see the bio date of people here. You can understand. Yes, yes, yes. That is right. Trust me. It will be done. Canadian girls are crazy about Mr. Banerjee. Hi. Hello. - May I have a seat? Please. - Thanks. Indian? Bengali? And you? - Same. Suzie. Suzie. Yes. - So is that name shortened from Suchitra or Sumona? Sujata. Actually no one could pronounce my name here. It would sound horrible. So I asked them to call me Suzie. By the way, I am Ria. I see. What after that? I was under a compulsion and had to share the place with someone. But I think you should have told your parents about your financial crisis. Then I wouldn't be able to stay here anymore. Mother is always tensed about me anyway. If she comes to know about all this, she will ask me to come back right away. Then how are you managing? I have already paid the college fees. If I can manage for sometime, the problem will be solved. By the way, what does your room mate do? My room mate? It would be better if you don't ask about him. He says he works in the share market. But I do have a doubt if he knows where the share market is. Hey.. - What is this? How did you come here? Internal connection. The kitchen. So why are there dirty dishes lying around? Go on. Come on, get lost. Hello, look at me. I did. I need salad. Right. Is this your uncle's house? He needs salad. You have cheated us of five dollars. Give me salad. I will do away with the bill. Forget about the money. Think of how to save your job first. I am not scared of losing the job. If you are not, I will make you scared. Haven't you given your photo at Mr. Banerjee's marriage bureau? If Hara comes to know about this.. ..he will make you stand in front of the door.. ..and kick you twice on your backside. What did you go there for? To sell wedding finery? Even you went there to look for a girl. If Parbati comes to know this... she will kick you on your backside once. That is it. Not anymore. Okay, Bhola. Why is the condition of Hara Parbati Rannaghar so bad? The condition was very good earlier. When both of them had an affair. - What? Meaning Hara and Parbati had an affair? Yes. Hara and Parbati had eloped from their house and come here. They came here and opened a small restaurant. And they named it as Hara Parbati Ranna ghar. The customers started coming in slowly. They took a bank loan and enlarged the restaurant. Look. Look. Those were such nice days. At night, when the restaurant used to close down.. ..both of them used to go for late night shows of cinema. At times, even I did. What happened? - What? What went wrong between them? The same one. Dirt. Hara liked a foreigner. That foreigner used to supply vegetables to this restaurant. And Hara used to feed her for free. Hara used to put sweet betel into her mouth at times on sly. Parbati saw it one day. That is it. The mess started. Hara and Parbati separated. - I see. Just as alcohol is bad for liver. True. - Yes. Brother, give me some. - No. Never. Why? You are a Bengali and being one, I will not let your liver get damaged. That is why I will have the entire bottle on my own. Now look at you. Now look, dear. In a foreign country.. - I know. I know. Only a Bengali can take care of a Bengali. No. Never. A drunkard looks after another. What? That was a lovely line. My heart feels happier. Come, brother. Come and give me a hug now. Come on. Come on. - Come on, brother. Now look at this. Where did he go? Come here. Now I will have the whole thing. Idiot! Hail Lord. Did you have alcohol? No. Never. Hey, don't lie at all. Your mouth is stinking of alcohol. Don't you remember my condition? I do, rural girl. I saw foreign brand of liquor and couldn't control my greed. I did drink. But I am absolutely fine. Now you will get a girl and say that you couldn't control your greed on seeing a foreigner. Yes, correct. Hey, I have come to Canada for that very reason. I will get her as soon as I get one. I feel like holding you by the shoulders and throwing you out. No, never. You cannot do that with me. Rural girl. Because only a Bengali will care for a Bengali in a foreign country. Get lost. Will you go to your room or should I call aunt Kathy? Call aunt Kathy? Do you think this is your father's property? Drunkard. I don't have time for your nonsense. I am going inside my room to study. Don't bother me at all. She is going to study! Idiot. Idiot? "Hey, the moon has risen. And the flowers have bloomed." "Who is it at the wedding altar?" "All the birds are peeking out of their nests."

"I am Mr. Bhojo Hori Manna." Madhu. I have got two customers. Make these ready quickly. I will serve it. Girl or boy? Girl. - Hey. Absolutely young! Hail Lord. Listen, darling. Listen, my sweet one. A pair of fish is looking at me. I will make such a nice dish that they will get up.. ..and say that they will marry the cook and keep him with them. Really. I had such nice and tasty food. It seems I am sitting in Kolkata. You will see. The one to marry this cook will be very happy. 20. 30. And 10 for the tip. That is settled. Come on, let us go. Hey, hey, why did you leave such a large tip? Oh never mind. I don't have change. And you liked the food. That is it. Listen, I didn't like it that much. I have change. I will give it. Now keep this. Don't mess with my business. You? What are you doing here, monkey? I am taking my hard earned money, rural girl. Who is he? He is my room mate. You said he works in the share market. Today, I know of your real identity. You are a liar of the first order. You work as a cook in the restaurant. And say that you work in the share market? Very good. So what? Listen. Boys do lie a bit to get attention from girls. There is leverage for 25%. 100% of what you say is a lie. You are not made of virtues as well. You were trying to steal my money. Thief. -Hey, did you call me a thief? Not a thief. A female thief. Meaning female thief. Just because you are angry, one cannot change his gender. A lot of paperwork is needed for that. I cannot stay with you at all. So go away. - Hey. I have not kept you as a joint account with me. Get out of here. Get out. - I.. I will not anywhere from here. You go. I will not move even an inch from here. That is it. Even I wouldn't go away from here. Monkey. - Get out of here. You go. - You have to leave. Rural girl. - Monkey! Is this your father's house? - Don't talk about my father at all. Excuse me. I think both of you have to vacate the house. Both of you are supposed to give the rent every week. - Sorry. This is the third week. Aunt. Aunt, I am very sorry. I promise. I will give all the money within 6.. I will pay the entire amount within 7 days. Even I will do the same. I mean even I will take seven days to pay. And apart from that.. ..only a Bengali can take care of a Bengali in a foreign country. Right? No, that is right. But you have should take care of me too. Even I have some compulsions. Right? If both of you cannot pay the rent within this week.. ..you will have to leave the house. Okay? Kathy? Hi. Oh Jenny, my dear. How are you? - Good. Okay, meet my new tenants. She is Ria. Hi. - Hi. And that is Madhusudan. Greetings. Are you fine? Oh my God. You are Bengali? I don't know. I am sorry but I really like Bengalis. Like? Like means she likes me. That means she has liked me for sure. Hey, even we Bengalis like girls like you a lot. I have done some research on Bengali culture. And I think they are really great people. Yes. Now she has gone overboard. Even our English teacher cannot speak English like that. She says she has done research on Bengalis. She feels that Bengalis are great. Yes, that is right. She is right. Hail Lord. - Yes, Hail Lord. Hail Lord. - By the way, I am Jennifer. Yes. I am Madhusudan. Madhu.. - Sudan. Madhusudan. Sudan. Oh no. No. No. Madhusudan. M. Dhu. Su. Dan. Madhusudan? - Yes. Did you see? Here she is. She has learnt Bengali. Okay. Enough of introduction. Jenny, let us go. By the way, hope both of you will remember about the rent. Okay? Come, dear. - Bye. Bye. - Yes. See you. She said see you. Meaning she wants to see me again? Jenny. Want to have coffee? I am telling you. So? Did you like a foreigner? It is something expensive. That is why it takes time. But I haven't left anything lacking. I have gone to Indo Canada marriage bureau and given my picture. Let me see. Which girl might get lucky? I have someone in mind. What? She is from here. - Here? Meaning she is white skinned? Who? - Jenny. Jenny? Will it happen? - Why not? How will it happen? I fumble so many times when I have to speak in English. And she speaks English fluently like a train. Between moon and.. - Oh no. So what if you don't know English? You have a lot of good qualities. - Good qualities? Mine? What? Like.. Like you are very humorous. You can make people laugh. - Yes. That is right. I am always Bidhan Das. Not Bidhan Das. Bindaas(full of life). Whatever it is. As long as it is Das. You have a lot of other qualities like.. - Hey. Forget about good qualities. Tell me. How do I look? My physique. My personality. - Not bad. Not bad? Hey, are you encouraging me or discouraging me? Look at me nicely and tell me. I have seen you properly and telling you thus. You are very handsome. I knew it. But I didn't know I am very handsome. Since you are saying it, I am sure I am. And my style? Superb. And my brain? Your brain is just great. Yes. Then why are you fooling me? Meaning? Listen, I know I couldn't pass my board exams. But I am not dumb enough for just anyone to come and fool me. Now tell me. What is the secret? What can it be? You are my friend. Hence I was helping you. Friends? Rural girl and I. How did the world change so quickly? This is the reason one mustn't help anyone. You are the one that says... Bengali can help another Bengali in a foreign country. That is right but what is your profit? I have no gain to make. There is. Try to find out nicely. I am sure the secret will spill out. Look. If Jenny and you get close.. ..then aunt Kathy will not bother us for the rent. Maybe she will do away with the rent completely. That is what I was wondering about. How did a bitter person like you start speaking so sweetly all of a sudden? What is the loss if this gives benefit to both of us? No, there is no loss. - No, right? In that case, friends. Friends. - Good. So friend.. - I have become your friend. Not your girlfriend. That is fine. But I cannot understand something. How will two people speaking different languages unite? Leave all that to me. Just do whatever I ask you to do from tomorrow. That is it. I am going. I will go and out in the gym properly. He has lost it. She is lying. She thinks I have lost it. Good morning, Jenny. - Good morning. It is a nice surprise. - Yes. So you exercise everyday? Yes, yes. I cannot speak too much of English. I will fall on my face before I speak more. So you want to go for a jog now? Jog(mug)? Why would she want a mug? I see. So while running, if she feels like doing.. ..she will sit on the field and start doing it? What? - What? One minute. I will explain. She is asking if you want to go for a jog with her. What? I will jog with her? Till now, I have just run after girls. For the first time, I will jog with someone. And then, she is a Canadian. Yes, yes. Yes. Yes. So let us go then. - Yes. Hey, come with us. Or else, she will speak English and make me go mad. Come on, come on. Jenny. Oh my God. Oh my God. I think you have become so good looking after running so much. Run. Run. - You guys carry on. I am tired. I will take a break. Hey. I think she will get impressed. She is looking at me and smiling all the time. What? I think I will talk to her about marriage now. Right now? - Yes. What if she starts liking someone else? All these good girls keep their options open. Hey. What do you think about girls? Speak English properly first. After that, you can talk to her about marriage. Hey, don't worry about that. A lot of rustic people have started speaking English.. ..after getting married to English people. And I wouldn't be able to learn English by having an affair with a foreigner? You will see. From tomorrow, I will start speaking English so fluently. You want to go for a jog? Want to run with me? Jog means running. Good morning, Jenny. - Good morning, Madhu. Let us go for a jog. Actually I am not in a mood for a jog. Let us go for a walk. Walk? Oh my God. She wants to puke right in the morning? What? Oh God. I cannot understand what this foreigner is saying. I have to learn this now? Let us go for a walk. Let us go for a walk. Not falk. Walk. Walk. Let us go for a walk. Come on, we will go for a walk. Let us go for a walk. Walk. Walk. Come on, we will go for a walk. Very good. Say that again. Let us go for a walk. Come on, we will go for a walk. Disgusting. Madhu! Did God give you fingers to dig into your nose? Yes. Or else, why would each finger have a different size? You cannot ever get cultured. Okay, why do girls always want to take... ..the responsibility of making boys cultured? They don't have any other work. - Hey, disgusting. Disgusting! Yuck! - What was that word? Let us go for a walk. Good morning, Jenny. Good morning, Madhu. Yes, let us go for a walk. Actually I am not in a mood for a walk. - What? Let us sit and enjoy the morning. Come. Oh no. She says different lines each day. Oh rural girl. Come here quickly. She has tortured me with a new line today. Hey rural girl. Hey, this side. What happened? She isn't talking. She is quiet. Will she talk to me? Hey, say something which will make her very happy. I am telling the truth. Not everyone can be like her. No one in Banipur or Canning can come close to her. Hey, not all this. Praise her. And I will translate that for her in English. - Okay. Fine. Jenny. - Yes, Madhu. Your skin glows. I feel like running my hands all over it. What? Say something apart from touching. I see. Okay. Jenny. I like you so much. I feel like making you sit on my bike and pressing the brakes. Oh no. What is he saying, Ria? One minute. Lowly and uncouth monkey! You wouldn't reform, right? If I translate that for her in English.. ..she will hit you with her shoes. I see. I thought since she is a foreigner, she will like it. Well, Jenny, he said that your voice is like honey. And so are you. Oh! No, Madhu. You are a sweetheart. What? Sweet? Hey, ask her not to say all this. Something will happen tonight for sure. You are such a darling. Come. Let us go and have some tea. What? Darling? Hey, tell me. What did you tell her? She has opened all the vistas for me and asking me to come to her. I told her that.. - Yes? That her voice is like honey. And so is she. I see. So she likes this more than sitting behind on the bike? Do whatever you feel like. Leave me alone. Hey, no, no, rural girl. -Hey! Don't go anywhere. She has called me as a darling because of you. Thank you. Thank you. Hey, Jenny. Where have you gone? God knows where is he lying as a corpse? He has not been coming to work for three days. He is not taking the call too. If I have to do all the work.. ..why do I need to employ people for work? "My heart is mad." "My heart is crazy." So you have come? Where were you? Mind your language. Give those abuses to your employees. Hey, Madhu. - Excuse me. Mr. Madhusudan Dutta. Care of Canada. Hey, you.. - Talk to me with respect. Listen, give me my pending money. I don't want to work in this lowly restaurant of yours. I see. Where did you get a job in the meanwhile? At the petrol pump? Or else, as a bodyguard of a white skinned person? Disgusting. Small people. Small views. You couldn't prosper in life. Hey, a gem like me should rot in this lowly restaurant of yours? High flying. By spreading my wings in the sky.. - Hey, you.. Hey, stupid! What have you done? It is broken? Don't worry. It is a simple glass. And I am a rich man. What is the price? What is the price? 10 dollars. Ten dollars? Only? Hey. - 20. 30. 40! Hey, what are you doing? Which father of yours will pay for the price of the glasses? Tell me. Why would my father give it? I will pay. Mr. Madhusudan Dutta. Care of Canada. Write down the accounts. 100 or 200 dollars are like.. Dirt on my hands. Because I am going to buy the Frenchie of around 30 restaurants very soon. Frenchie? It is not Frenchie. Franchisee. Fool. Hey, whatever it might be. But I am taking it. Hey, have you invested in gambling? No, never. Mr. Madhusudan Dutta. Care of Canada. I have chosen a girl from here. And I will marry her. Has anyone in your family got married to someone from Canada? - Hey. I see. I am going to feed some poor beggars in my wedding. You can come as well. So.. Think about that and call on my number. Okay. "My heart is mad." Hey. Even this is broken. No problem. You will get your price for this as well. Who will pay? Mr. Madhusudan Dutta. Care of Canada. Bye, bye. "My heart is mad." "My heart is crazy." God knows where he has gone. Hey, rural girl, what is the matter? You are cooking? You want to cook for my bachelor's party so early on? Where were you? Why? I have told Jenny that you will cook Bengali food for her. Okay. You can cook it. And I will use my hands to feed her. Hey, a Bengali can take care of a Bengali in a foreign land. Very funny. Here you are. Hold this. Cook for your own wife. Don't want to live in this country permanently? Come on. Come on. Come on. Cook. Come on, start. Come on. I will become permanent anyway, rural girl. Hail Lord. Hail Lord. How did they start showing Bengali serial on the music channel... all of a sudden? What are you saying? She will not let me stay good now. Come in, come inside now. Come. Sit. Sit. I will get a heart attack because of happiness. You are wearing this dress and speaking in Bengali. How did all this happen? The dress is mine. And I have taught her Bengali as well. I thought rather than teaching you English.. ..I can teach her Bengali. Wow. That was a great thing to do. I have been speaking English for some days... ..and can sense an indigestion of sorts. Madhu. I have something to tell you in Bengali. About how I feel. She wants to tell you about her feelings in Bengali. I want to hear that. Tell me. Tell me. Madhu. - Tell me, sweet one. When I see you, I feel.. - Tell me quickly. I cannot take this anymore. I feel you are a fool. Very good, Jenny. Couldn't you teach her something nice? I thought if she has to have an affair with a Bengali boy.. ..she needs to know a few Bengali abusive words as well. I am sorry. Don't be angry. What I really wanted to say is that.. ..I like you. Like? Really? Meaning you are impressed? And I think I am falling for you. - What? Falling? Meaning.. Hey, when I saw you for the first time.. ..I fell flat on my face. Fool. Oh my darling. "You are the only one that I want." "The only place where I belong." "And this I know for sure." "I never want to let you go." "God knows what happens to me at times." "My heart feels lonely." "It gets lost in your thoughts." "Without any sense of timing." "My heart becomes intoxicated." "It is in your intoxication all the time." "The breeze told me secretly in my ears." "You are mine." "The wanderer heart tells me." "You are mine." "The breeze told me secretly in my ears." "You are mine." "The wanderer heart tells me." "You are mine." "I wait for you. Through all day." "You are never far away." "And this I know for sure." "I never want let you go." "My sleep breaks off at midnight." "At the sign of the stars." "I keep on drawing your pictures." "On a known and unknown path." "Let us float away on an unknown path." "Where will the world hide you?" "I don't know when this happened to the heart." "It gets attracted to you." "I look for your address." "And both of us will pass that horizon together." "The breeze told me secretly in my ears." "You are mine." "The wanderer heart tells me." "You are mine." "The breeze told me secretly in my ears." "You are mine." "The wanderer heart tells me." "You are mine." "Why do you look so nice?" "When I look at you, the world around me stops." "I stay awake for you every day." "I will find you slowly." "I will bind you by my signs." "Try to understand my condition." "These days, my heart runs." "According to your signs."

"The only place where I belong." "And this I know for sure." "I never want to let you go." I can say this much, aunt. There cannot be a boy like Madhu. He is decent. And is good by behavior and character too. Even you know that. And apart from that, he will even cook for his wife. Your skin is so white. He will keep Jenny very happy, aunt. - I know. If he has to marry Jenny, he has to adjust with Jenny. - Yes. No local Canadian boy will agree to that. Aunt. I agree with everything. I will say yes to everything that you say. I will say yes to your proposal of live in son-in-law as well. Okay? Very good. So let us fix a date before the 20th of next month. Yes. After marriage, both of you can go to Africa. No, aunt. I don't want to go to America. No, no, not America. Africa. - What? Africa? Why? Jenny is going to Africa on the 20th of next month. Didn't she tell you? Hail lord. Yes. Hail lord. Why? She has a wish. She wants to serve poor people of Africa. Now only a week back, she has taken a project of UNO. She has taken Nigerian citizenship as well. What? No. No. I cannot marry her. I have come to Canada from Kolkata to get permanent residence here. No. Never. Ria. I will not marry her. Marriage is cancelled. What? - What did you say? Marriage is cancelled. Fool. Lowly person. You are such an idiot. - Hey! You can rot on the streets. Get lost. I don't want to see your face ever again. Aunt.. - If I see you in this area ever again.. ..I will call the police and get you arrested. I am telling you. Get out. Oh no. I thought of something and something completely different happened. Madhu. One minute. It is a foreign country. And secondly, you are alone. Thirdly, you don't have a place to stay. And fourth, it is very cold. I know you cannot stand me. But I cannot leave you alone in such a huge world. Thank you. Here you are. Wrap this up and sleep in the park. Okay? All the best. No, no, don't say thank you. Only a Bengali can take care of a Bengali in a foreign country, right? Bye. Hey, rural girl. I climbed up the tree and plucked the mangoes. But you were at the root of the tree. You will have the mangoes and want me to lick the seed sitting alone? You could have told aunt that both of us were in this together. Keep quiet. Listen, if you stand here for a long time.. ..aunt will call the police. Get lost. - Hey. Before that, I will go and tell the old woman. Madhu. - Aunt! Madhu! - Aunt. Madhu! Don't worry. - Madhu. - Aunt. You? You have come here again? Aunt. You have thrown me out of the house. Okay. But the truth is that I have not done anything alone. Ria has asked me to do this. No, no, aunt. - Why are you lying to aunt? I am simple man. I cannot even speak English properly. Actually she gave me the idea. Flirt with Jenny. Cook for Jenny. And then, she made me jog, walk and everything. She made me do everything. And she has also told me that if Jenny gets impressed.. ..we can stay here for free. No, no, aunt, I have not sad anything like that. He is lying. Lying? Then who taught me English and made me go for a run everyday in the morning? Jog? Candlelight dinner. Will you keep quiet? Why are you laughing? Have you gone mad? Not mad. I have seen a lot of people get thrashed. But this is the first time I saw someone going ahead... ..to stand to get a thrashing. Hey. - Shut up. Hey, rural girl. Where are you going? Firstly, it is a foreign land. Secondly, you are alone. Thirdly, you don't have a place to stay. And fourth, it is very cold. Do something. Take this blanket. Wrap this up and sleep in the park. I.. - Don't thank me. Only a Bengali can help a Bengali in a foreign land. Listen, I don't need your sympathy. I will find a place to stay. Worry about yourself. No, I am fine. I will stretch my legs and sleep on this bench. I will sleep. And Bipasha along with me. Crap, get lost. - You get lost. I don't trust you at all. Then I will see that you will come back at night.. And tell me to share this bench with you. Hey, listen. I would rather get crushed by a car than come to you. And die. - What? So die. Idiot. Monkey. Rural girl! Hey, what are you doing? - Leave it. Leave it. Leave it. - Leave it. Thank God. I don't have to suffer the torture of this rural girl anymore. Thank God. The monkey has left me alone at the end. Now you didn't come for work for so long. And I incurred a loss. Who will pay for that? I will pay it. Say it with respect. Say it with a little bit of respect. Who will pay it? Mr. Madhusudan Dutta, care of Canada, will pay. Permanent? Temporary. And my glasses were broken. Who will pay for it? Even that will be paid by.. ..Mr. Madhusudan Dutta, care of Canada. Temporary. Should I give some juice to you? It fell down and broke. Never mind. The price for this too will be paid by Mr. Madhusudan Dutta, care of Canada. What? Why should I pay for this? I didn't break it. It is a simple glass. Rich man. Now 100 or 200 dollars are like dirt on your hand. Sister. I will pay for everything gradually. Please give me work. I have a condition. You have to get rid of Bhola from Hara's kitchen within 2 days. Or else, you will have to run away from here. Okay. What? Should I put this nail flower on your finger? Not nail flower. Nail polish. Whatever it is. Should I apply it? Yes. Oh no. Couldn't you apply it even on one nail? You are useless. And want to marry a white skinned girl? Get lost. Go and do your work. Go. Yes. Fool. I have got into trouble. Who knows when I will get out of this? You have come back, brother? To clean glass and utensils? Now you look like my brother-in-law. Good morning. Good morning. So? Did you sleep? - Very well. Thanks a lot, Suzie. I was really tensed yesterday. If you had not given me a place to stay, I would have.. - Come on. My parents have gone out for four days. You can stay with me in the meanwhile. When they come back, I can shift you to my aunt's apartment. And don't worry about it. It is all sorted out. - Thanks a lot. Suzie. I.. I was thinking of something else. If I get a part time job, I can pay the house rent. That is not a bad idea. Let me see. Yes? Hara Parbati Ranna ghar. Mr. Bhola Das speaking. Hey, son. This is Mr. Banerjee from Indo Canadian marriage bureau. Did you give a picture in my office? Yes, I did. So a Canadian girl liked you a lot on seeing that picture of yours. What? She liked me picture? But there is nothing to be happy about. There is a problem. Problem? Is the girl blind? No, no, she is fine where that is concerned. - I see. Fine. Then there is no problem. But she has three conditions. Three conditions? What are they? The first one is that you have to be live in son-in-law. Live in son-in-law? As soon as the alliance is finalized, I can stay at the girl's house. But the second condition is very tough. Second condition is very tough? What is it? Actually she is the only daughter of her parents. That is why she likes traveling. You have to take her to the night club for dancing everyday. Never mind. If she so wishes, I will take her to nightclub everyday. Wow. And third condition is.. - Let it be. Third or fourth. Whatever her conditions might be. I am ready for her conditions. Ready? Wow. - Yes. This is great. Do something. Pack your bag and take tonight's train and reach Toronto tomorrow. Yes. She will wait for you at the station tomorrow in the morning. Do reach at ten in the morning for sure. Yes. Okay. - Don't be late at all. Tell me. What is the name of the girl? What? Name? Yes. Latika. Latika? But this is a Bengali name. Oh wow. She liked your photo so much.. ..that she changed her name before marriage. From Lilantica to Latika. From Lilantica to Latika. From Latika to Lilantika. I have trapped the fool. Hey, fool. You are dancing here? And the pulses are burning on the other side. Yes, now your fortune will burn. And then, your restaurant will close down. Because the doors of my fortune have opened up. I will give you one slap. - Hey, Hara. I am not Bhola from Canning anymore. I am Mr. Bhola Das from Canada. Talk with respect. Your restaurant can go to hell. I am leaving. Yes. Hey, where are you going? I will not tell you. But if you trouble me.. - Hey. I am sure this is the deed of that fighter woman. Excuse me. - Yes? Can I have chicken please? Yes, yes, yes. Here you are. Take this. If you use such a lot of saliva to count money.. ..your tongue will dry up. Hey, don't cast an evil eye. Here you are. Keep five dollars. Oh God, it is wet with spit. Give it. Don't take it. - No, no. I will keep it covered with a stone on the terrace. It will dry up. Listen, Madhu. - Yes? We have played a good move. Wait and watch. He wouldn't get a cook in the whole of Canada. If he does, I will get rid of the cook. - Yes. I think the food is good.. - Let us go there. Sir. Hello.. - Hello! Please come here.. - That is nice. What is the matter? Why is everyone going that side today? And we have been casting away flies since morning. Parbati. We have to get her inside. Madam. - Madam. Madam. Come to the next one. We have made special menu today. -Yes. There is special pulses. Raw banana dish. Yes. - The fried rice with nine herbs. Mango chutney. Yes. Chutney. - Please do come in. You will get whatever you want. Come inside. - Come inside. Madam. - Yes? Why are you going that side? Good food is this side. I have made prawns with cream today. Come inside and check. Everyone is relishing it. It is stale food kept for three days, madam. - What? He is heating it and feeding to customers. Oh my God. What is it that she is saying? Why are you listening to her? I don't behave like her and give leftovers... ..with a new garnish to new customers. Disgusting. Is that true? What do you do? Yes? He gives stale food to customers. And sprays fragrance on the food. So that they cannot get the stale stench of the food. Oh my God. Call someone and ask as to why she doesn't have customers in her shop. Two days back, there was a strand of hair in curd fish. Forget about asking for forgiveness from the customer. Do you know what he said? I have to tear off my hair while looking for Hilsa fish. - What? Let it be. Let it be. I don't want to eat at anyone's restaurant. - What? What is she saying? I would rather go home and boil pulses and rice at home. No. - Madam, listen to me. Listen to me. This happened because of you.. If you say another word, I will strangle you.. Come on, teach him a lesson. Hey, give him one good thrashing. - Hey, leave me. Come on, come on, shout. Shout more. Hey, hey, hey.. - Keep quiet. Leave him right now.. - Hey, who is this girl? Who is this? - Lowly goon. Don't you feel ashamed? Just because he is alone, you are hitting a man of your father's age? Look at him. I am in such a huge problem. He would have killed me if you weren't there..- He should have. Don't worry about it. I will take care of this monkey. I can see a lot of attitude in you. I thought you have packed your bags and gone home. Why would I go home? The one who doesn't have a place to stay and lives on the street has to go home. Hey, rural girl. I don't stay on the streets. I live in a big compartment. Not compartment. Apartment. Hey, forget your English. Listen, if you are hungry, have food here and leave. She will not go anywhere. In fact, both of you should pack your things and leave. Why? Why? For your kind information, she is my new family member. New cook. Cookie instead of cook? Hey, fool. A cookie means a biscuit. Hey, I know. I know. I know everything. What do you know? Listen.. - Leave it, Hara. Leave it. Come on. Let us go inside. Don't fight with these lowly people.. - What? And ruin our goodwill.. - Yes. And in any case, customers are waiting for us. Hey, hey.. - Hey, get lost. Get lost. ..I am falling into one trouble after the other. Firstly, I lost all my money. And then, I even lost the house I used to stay on rent. I don't have a place to stay now. What shall I do? I cannot understand anything. Lord has made a way for everyone. And there are moments of sadness and happiness on the way. Serve Lord with all your heart, dear. Everything will be fine. Oh yes. Did you get offerings? No. - I will give it. Hey, who is it? Come here. What? - Even he was in a condition like yours. He didn't have a place to stay. He slept all night on the street. I let him stay here. He works. And serves Lord in his spare time. Madhu, take her. Give her offerings. Where is it? Your compartment. One where you stayed alone? It isn't a compartment. It is an apartment. It will take some time. It is getting painted. Liar. Come on, I will give you offerings. Oh no, I found a place for me. And she has come here too. Hello. - How are you? Tell me. Don't ask me. I have to cook all day. Now I have to go to take care of the restaurant now. What is it? You are still in the restaurant? No, no, I have left it long back. Now I will go to eat at the restaurant. Excuse me. Do you know where the train station is? Yes. Do you have your girlfriend with you? Where is it? Yes, yes. What a weirdo! What are you saying, brother? What? Now girls have such a lot of demands. She said she wants to watch a movie and then, have food. Yes, yes, Madhu. Come on, go for it. Okay, okay, hang up now. My driver has come with the car. I will talk later. Listen. - What? Madhu has gone there and seeing a foreigner woman there. What? He wasn't getting a job here because he had failed his tenth exams. And there, he has got a foreigner woman. How did he do it? Hey, he had a lot of internal connections. I see. - His father knows a lot of people. He made some recommendations and.. ..got his son to have an affair with a foreigner's daughter. You are right. I need salt. Oh no. Salt is over. Rural girl. What do you want? I don't want anything. I came to find out about you. Hey, dear. Only a Bengali will take care of a Bengali in a foreign land. And then, we are neighbors. Now we will continue fighting. Now I wanted to say.. Meaning if you ever need something.. ..do ask me for it. Okay? Now it could be oil, rice or pulses. Vegetables. And yes, even salt. If you need salt, do ask me for it. Don't hesitate. I don't want anything. - Not even salt? No. Not even salt. - But I do want it, rural girl. The left one is 18. And the right is 17. Hey, has it become less? You were right. Only a Bengali can take care of a Bengali in a foreign land. Now suppose if you need something. Like corn flour is over. Or while going to lock the door of the restaurant.. ..you saw that the key isn't working. You can tell me in that case. Wow, wow, wow, wow. I saw something. You girls are very smart. You can tell me directly that you cannot lock the door. Why are you beating around the bush, rural girl? So even you could have said directly that you need salt. Why did you beat around the bush, monkey? Here you are. I was thinking that there could be differences between Hara and Parbati. Let us not fight anymore. Right? Yes. I mean both of us can help each other. Yes. You are right. Ria. - Yes? I wanted to say that if I say good night to you.. ..would you have a problem? No. Good night. Good night. Good night. Okay? Good night. - Yes. I don't think the bus will come today. If the bus doesn't come, you will get late. If the bus doesn't come, even you will get late. Yes. That is right. Hey, do you want to go by taxi? By sharing? If they see us getting down together.. ..both of us will lose our jobs. Okay. We will get down a little ahead. Okay. Miss Ria. Tell me something. I agree I am in a bad condition. That is why I am compelled to cook in a hotel. But why did you have to take up a job of a cook? Even I am not in a good condition. Or else.. ..no one would work as a cook in a foreign country.. ..when one has come to study. Okay, Madhu. Tell me something. Have you spoken to Jenny lately? - Have you lost your mind? I don't go that way even by mistake. You haven't behaved well with her. You should ask for forgiveness from Jenny. What? Why would I ask for forgiveness? Now the entire fault is mine, right? You didn't do anything. Who was the one to instigate me? - What? Who told me? Madhu, get married to Jenny. You will get a permanent ration card. You are good looking. I told you and you agreed with me. Haven't you seen yourself in the mirror? Good looking. God made you with his left hand. You look like a lowly person. So even you are not good looking either. You will never get married ever. No girl would ever marry you. Wait and watch. - Are you cursing me? Yes. I am. Brother. Stop the car. - No. The car wouldn't stop. Keep driving, driver. Didn't you hear what I said? - No, don't stop. You keep driving. - I don't want to go with her. Why are you fighting with each other? - Just keep driving. Stop. - Monkey. Don't go. -Go. I am asking you to stop. - Get out of the car. She is a lowly person. You follow me everywhere. - I didn't do anything. You did it too. Got it? Don't talk too much. - I was right in doing so. Get lost. - Ten dollars. I am giving it. Wait. Here you are. Give him the rest. I am giving it. Rice tastes really nice. What did you say? I didn't understand. The job profile of a boy doesn't matter. His heart should be good. Just like yours. Friends. No, no, no, never. I am not falling for your lies again. Tell me the truth. I cannot be cheated of five dollars right in the morning. Not five dollars. One dollar. I am short of one dollar. Please. Give it. After all.. ..if a Bengali doesn't look after a Bengali in a foreign country, who will? Tell me. You mean to say that I have to give a loan of one dollar, right? Okay, I can pay. But on one condition. You have to make a promise of giving it back to me. Yes, yes. I will give. I will give everything back. I swear on you. Will you remember? Here you are, uncle. Thank you. - Welcome. Okay. You told me in the taxi that I look like over boiled rice. Did you say that in a fit of anger? That means the real truth is what you said earlier. Absolutely. Wow. Meaning I look great. Great. It will do. - Monkey. Liar. She is still lying to me. Hey, there is a customer. - There is a customer. Let me go and get hold of him. - Come on. Get hold of him. I am not here to eat, guys. Sir. We have made flat bread with filling today. -Yes. Yes, delicious potato curry. - Yes, yes. Well, I am looking for Haranath Das. Myself Haranath, sir. Good food. Parbati Shashmal. - Yes, sir. I am the one, sir. Present, please. Well, guys, I am here to inform you on the behalf of my bank. The bank loan is pending for the last six months. Now if you don't pay in 30 days.. ..I am sorry to say that we have to cease your property. Is that clear to both of you? Now sir, I want your signature here. Right here, sir. What does he want to eat? Thank you. Ma'am. Yours. Right here. Thank you. Now here is the notice. Have a good day. What is this? Did he ask to send the food to him? What is the case? Now there is another trouble brewing. I had thought that I will come to Canada and get married. And now, forget about marrying. I am tired of getting rid of these troubles. When they had taken the loan.. ..both of them had an affair. Both of them had one restaurant. And now, both of them are always at loggerheads. It has been six months since they paid any installment. Now within a month, if they cannot pay the bank loan.. ..this hotel will close down. And we will lose our jobs too. Crap. We.. Whenever we are in trouble, we get into it together. You are laughing? Have you thought of what will happen if we lose our jobs? That is also true. Okay. In order to save our jobs, they have to pay off the loan. But one person cannot pay it off alone. Both of them have to be reunited. Yes. Right. Great idea! Isn't it? - Absolutely. That is why I say that only a Bengali... can take care of a Bengali in a foreign country. If people see us sitting together like this.. ..people will think that two beggars are sitting here to beg for alms. Actually.. I wanted to say something to you. Both of us shook hands normally. I mean like friends. Yes. Yes. Meaning even I was thinking of that. We will not think of these small matters seriously. Okay. As I will get married and stay back here. You will go back to the country. Your.. I owe you a dollar. I see. Yes. That is right. I was thinking that I have forgotten to say something to you. Do remember to give it. Okay? Don't forget. Okay. I am leaving. Good night. - Good night. Good night. You saved me. In some more time, I would have been afflicted. Thank God the matter was done away with right here. Or else, I would have been in a problem. Couldn't you think of something else? You have come to give me an advice? You want to me to unite with that fighter woman. And hug her. When she crosses my path, I feel a cat has crossed my path. I know that Parbati is a bit like a cat. She isn't that beauty fall. Not beauty fall. Beautiful. Hey, whatever it is. But don't you think it is better to have a fighter cat at the door.. ..than a bank notice at home? Isn't it? - No. Bank notice is way better than a cat. Has the bank sent a notice to me alone? The notice has gone to him too. I would prefer to remain mute all my life.. ..than to talk to a person like him. But what happened between the two of you? Why did the two of you separate? That fool fell for a foreigner woman. The girl used to supply vegetables here. She came and spoke to him with a smile for two days. And God. He fell head over heels in love with her. And then, he used to let that fool eat for free. That is it. Even I caught hold of him. And not just feeding her. - What else did he do? I did give her 420 betel leaf to her. So what was the big deal about it? Oh no. This was a very sad case. But there is something that is making me confused, Hara. Oh no, that is not the correct word. Confused. Hey, whatever it is. I do lose my mind when it comes to understanding English. But you fell for that English woman's English and gave her a betel leaf? Hey, the problem was because I didn't understand. She used to come and tell me. I love my hubby. I love my hubby. I didn't know that hubby means husband. I thought she is heavily in love with me. That is it. I made separate hotels since that day. Parbati. All men are the same. As long as their women for home are fixed.. ..they look for their options elsewhere. But it is our responsibility to take care of men. Don't keep your possessions lying outside for a long time. Take it up. Forgive Hara and.. - Never. I cannot forgive a characterless man like him ever. It would be better for you to forgive him. Or else, your prized hotel will go to the bank. And Hara will go to the foreigner woman. Look, Hara. This isn't going to benefit me. But if you don't unite with Parbati.. ..you will be in trouble. Pig. Not that. The word is sure. Hey, whatever it is. But you will be in trouble for sure. Okay. Whatever you say. Come on. - No, I will not go. Come on. I am telling you. - Come on. Come with me. No. Leave me. I don't want to go. -Come with me. Tell me. Say sorry. Sorry. - Okay. Yes. - That is great. Hara Parbati be.. - Hailed. "Hey, Babu(sir). Babu." "Hey, Babu(sir). Babu." "Bengali Babu." "Hey, Babu(sir). Babu." "Bengali Babu." "Hey, Babu(sir). Babu." "Bengali Babu." "Hey, Babu(sir). Babu." "Bengali Babu." "Hey, Babu(sir). Babu." Mother. - Ria. Where did you get hurt? Yes? Where? One minute. Here you are. I am leaving. - Go carefully. Yes. - Ria. I was saying that this is a foreign country. And you are a girl. Thirdly, it is night. And fourth, you are hurt. Come on, I will drop you. No, no, I will be able to go. In any case, you have done a lot for me. Who will do if not me? And who else do you have here? Hey, only a Bengali can take care of a Bengali in a foreign land. Right? Come on, I will drop you. Come on.. - No, no. I will go. Sure. Okay. Call me when you reach. - Okay. Hey. Ria. Did you get hurt? Yes? I told you I will drop you. Here you are. Come on. Come on. Careful. - Yes. Thank you. - Don't worry. "We meet time and again." "Why does she turn around and look at me?" "I don't get sleep. And the day doesn't go by." "I am listening to it all day." "I can hear her words all of a sudden." "My heart cannot take it. I cannot wake up from sleep." "Why do I feel this restlessness in my heart?" "What is the reason because of which there is sadness in my heart?" "Is this love?" "Or is it a time for getting nothing in return?" "Is this love?" "Or is it a time to spend nights without sleep?" "Is this love?" "Or is it a time for getting nothing in return?" "Is this love?" "Or is it a time to spend nights without sleep?" "Why do I feel this restlessness in my heart?" "What is the reason because of which there is sadness in my heart?" "Is this love?" "Or is it a time for getting nothing in return?" "Is this love?" "Or is it a time to spend nights without sleep?" "When you are with me or close to me." "I am incapable of thinking anything else." "I don't care about people. Or about anyone." "I have so many secret words to say." "There are so many signs that come out of your eyes." "Your look is wounding my heart and meting out injustice." "Why do I have this intoxication now?" "Why is the heart thinking of a future with you?" "Is this love?" "Or is it a time for getting nothing in return?" "Is this love?" "Or is it a time to spend nights without sleep?" Be careful. Watch your step. Yes, be careful. Ria. Isn't this a surprise for you? Bikram. You are here? I took a flight to Vancouver. I thought of meeting you once. Did I trouble you? No, no. Not at all. He is Madhu. He is my friend. And he is Bikram. My fianc�. Hi. Captain Bikram Sen. I am only Madhusudan Dutta. Only? What happened to your foot? I got hurt at work. That is why Madhu came to drop me. You have changed so much, Ria. You have been in such a lot of problem. And yet, you didn't let me know even once? Problem? What else? I followed the address of the earlier place... you were staying at and went there. I heard you were sharing a room with a boy. No, I mean.. - I mean.. - No, no, captain sir. That boy is no one else. It is me. We were like enemies there. Don't think otherwise about it. I am not thinking anyway, Mr. Only Madhusudan Dutta. Yes. And apart from that, Ria is my childhood friend. I know her very well. Childhood friend? And yet, you are marrying her? Hey, will you keep quiet? - Oh no. When two intelligent people are talking.. ..a fool shouldn't interrupt. Captain sir. - Yes? I have come here to marry a Canadian girl. If you want to get married to a foreigner woman.. ..do tell me. It isn't a big deal to get a white skinned girl here. Why just white? Black, white, blue, green, yellow. No girl would marry you. Your face is so ugly. Cannot you speak nicely, rural girl? Keep quiet now. You keep quiet. - Okay, one minute. One minute. One minute. You don't have to find a foreigner woman for me. And you don't have to fight with her either. In any case, I am going back to India with her day after. Day after? - So soon? Yes. Her course is complete. And our wedding date has been fixed which is one month from now. I have been given the responsibility of getting the bride back to the country. Congratulations on the wedding. Take care. Thank you. Will you excuse me for two minutes? Let me freshen up. We will have coffee after that. Sure. Congress for the wedding. Not Congress. The word is congrats. So I shall leave. No, I mean.. I wanted to say.. Have coffee before leaving. It will be very late. We will meet tomorrow. Are you coming for work tomorrow? "Lord." I think I cannot. "My Lord." I have to do the packing. So? That means we wouldn't meet? "Lord." "Why does the day to lose you come closer?" "Why does the day to lose sight of you come close?" "Some people get it." "And heart goes back." "Into your dreams again." "Hey, my heart is sad." "Where will you leave it alone and go?" "Hey, I am very sad." "Hey, my friend. Come back." She has gone back, Bipasha. She will go. She didn't come here to stay. Let her go. It is good in one way. I haven't dreamt of a foreigner woman since so long. From now on, I will dream of one everyday. But.. But the problem is that.. No. There is no problem. Everything is fine. But I cannot understand something. Who will I address as rural flower from now on? "While smiling, the flowers have gone dry today." "They are gone. They have faded. The colors of yesterday." "I had so many things to say to you. I didn't say them to you." "The surroundings feel so lonely. This isn't my country." "Now. Let me go back to your dreams again." "Hey, my heart is sad." "Where will you leave it alone and go?" "Hey, I am very sad." "Hey, my friend. Come back." "With you, there was a shower of happiness around." "Why is there sadness today?" "Both of us have picked up kites in the evening." "Come back. Come back. Both of us will be together again." "Come on. Let us go back to your dreams again." "Hey, my heart is sad." "Where will you leave it alone and go?" "Hey, I am very sad." "Hey, my friend. Come back." Okay, what is the name of the son of your uncle? Sunanda. Sunanda. I cannot remember this name. Listen. - Yes? Which sari should I keep for Bikram's mother? This one or this one? You are showing a sari to me? Ask me the brand of good liquor. I will be able to tell you. Show the sari to Ria. See it, dear. Which one should I keep? Keep the one that you like, mother. What has happened to you? I have noticed since the time you have come back. You seem lost. It is your wedding. And yet, you seem to be away from all the preparations. What has happened? Tell me. What.. Nothing.. It is nothing. I am sure something has happened. We have been buying things for the marriage since so long. You didn't fight with me even once about choosing the saris. Whatever you buy will be good. Right, mother? You will get married after some days. If you are happy, you can keep everyone happy at your in-laws'. No, no, don't worry about the in-laws. I just have something to tell you, dear. Don't go away from your father with any pain in your heart. Okay? Okay. "Listen, my good son. Come close. Come close. Come close." "Come close." Hello. Hello. Rural girl? You? It is me. How are you? I am fine. How are you? Okay.. I thought of letting you know. I am getting married on the next 15th. Aren't you getting married a little too soon? You could have got married after some time. Why? What would have happened if I did get married after some days? That is right. What would have happened if you did wait for some more time? Why should one wait when one has got a good choice.. ..where a life partner is concerned? Okay. Tell me something. Aren't you missing me? Why would I miss you? I have Bipasha to talk to. And then, I am dreaming of new foreigner women everyday. Why should I miss you? Okay. You are missing me. Right? Miss? A monkey like you? Not at all. Then why did you call me? That was.. That was because I remember all of a sudden.. ..that I have to give one dollar to you. That is why I thought I will pay off all the debts before marriage. I see. So you have called to repay the debt. Okay. Don't worry about that. You are.. You always fight with me. Please. At least don't fight with me today. I didn't start the fight. You started it. And I will finish it. Yes. Come on. I write off all your debts. Slacks and get married. It isn't slack, monkey. It is relax. Whatever it is. You are getting married. Yes. I am. Okay, so hang up now. I have a lot of work. I will call later. Madhu. I.. Oh no. Okay. When you cannot think about me.. ..even I wouldn't think of you. Madhu. You got a call. From where? From Indo Canadian marriage bureau. They have seen a girl for you. Foreigner girl. -Yes. What is it? Aren't you happy? Why wouldn't I be happy? I have come to Canada to marry a foreigner woman. Can't you see me and understand how happy I am? Who are you trying to fool? Yes? A wound. And a tummy that is six months pregnant cannot be hidden. It will show the pain for sure. When is Ria's wedding? Why would I know when her wedding is? Am I going to do catering at her wedding? Hey, don't try to cheat your heart, Madhu. Do whatever your heart asks you to do. Yes. - What should I do? Should I have unshaven beard and long hair and roam around on the roads? Even she could have told me. But what did she say? She hasn't given me a dollar. She wanted to pay off the debts before marriage. Hey, fool. Wanted to pay the debts? Meaning she wanted to tell you about her feelings. She could have told me directly. Girls cannot express their feeling directly, Madhu. - Yes. Here you are. Call her. Come on. - Call her. Fool! What is it? Did you get through? It says switched off. Son, I think you have to go back to Kolkata to take one dollar back. Madhu. The wedding date of Ria is coming close. Don't delay. Go. Go. Go! Let it be. Let it be. I have scolded you a lot. Don't forget us. Okay? - Never. Go. Hello. Kali Pada speaking. Yes, Madhu here. Can you hear me? Yes, tell me. I am coming back to the country. Come to the airport to pick me up tomorrow. And we have to get your sister-in-law as well. What? He is here. Play it. - He is here. Hey, what is this? What are you doing? Hey. Hey, what is happening here? Yes? - Hey! Where is daughter-in-law? I have come to get her. Have you kept sister-in-law inside? Stop playing! Hey, I have been telling them that I have come to get their sister-in-law. What is the meaning of this foolishness? Father. Go home. Go and tell mother to decorate the veneration plate. I am getting your daughter-in-law. Come on. Let us go. - Hey.. - Hey! Don't ask me anymore. The market is in such a bad condition. Uncle. Where is the Ballygunge circular road? When you go ahead, there is a signal. And then, take a left from there. How long will it take? Now around ten minutes. Okay. Thank you. Yes. - Shall I leave? - Take care, dear. Yes. I am leaving. - Yes. What happened? Why are you walking around here like this? I am very worried. I am very worried about our son. Look, since the time he has come back, he isn't eating. Nor talking to anyone. He is not saying anything. He is sitting quietly. I have never seen him in such a sad state ever. Go. Go and talk to him once. If you have come to pacify me, don't bother. I have no wish to speak about her. When a son becomes of the same height as his father.. ..he becomes like a friend. No. I have not come to pacify you. Do whatever you wish to do. Just don't sit in a closed room like this. Forget about me. But think about mother. Come out of the house and meet your friends and all. Be happy. Look. I had come to tell you about this rest. It is not rest, dad. It is request. Whatever it is. Do listen to me. If fear is gone, my name will go for a toss. Close down Karachi. What.. - Hey, sorry. Hey, Mr. Only Madhusudan Dutta. In India? How is everything? Fine. I have come to the country. How are you? Fine. And Ria? - Even she is fine. She is only waiting for someone. Meaning? I didn't understand anything. What kind of a friend are you? You remained so close and yet, you didn't understand this much? Actually what happened was that I called Ria three days before the marriage. Ria. We are childhood friends. We mustn't hide things from each other... which will make us lose respect for each other in the future. We wouldn't hide, right? No. Even I wouldn't hide. - Meaning? Ria, our marriage was fixed since a long time. And we are childhood friends. And we will be life partners. I had thought that we will fall in love for sure. I did love. But I fell in love with Lisa. Lisa? Air hostess. We have flown to many countries together. And then I understood that we have fallen in love with each other. Look, I know. It is lowly to say these things three days prior to the marriage. But what should I do? Before telling you, I thought about it a lot. And tried to explain myself as well. But I couldn't. Okay. You tell me. Can love be controlled? Anyone can fall in love with anyone at any time. Isn't it? I don't know why but my heartbeat becomes faster when I see her. There is lightening in my body. I mean there is a light of.. - Light of seven colors in a rainbow. There are thousands and thousands of stars in the sky at night. And that light has fallen on you. Yes, absolutely. Hey, one minute. How did you.. Did you experience the same? Who did you see? Me? Why? Isn't there any other boy except you in this world? Meaning? On seeing someone else? Your marriage is fixed and someone else.. Disgusting. Didn't you feel ashamed? Didn't you feel ashamed? Lowly. Characterless man. If we have to judge that, both of us are characterless. But seriously, how should I explain to my family? I cannot understand that. Leave all that on me. Just be ready to marry Lisa after three days. That is it. Thank you. Come on. Characterless man. That means Ria didn't get married to you? How can I? Thank God Ria understood the situation. And you did tell me not to marry her. You are still standing here? The show has started. Let me introduce. He is Madhu. Ria's friend. And she is Lisa. My wife. Hi. Bye. I don't have time to wait. - Hey, listen. Hey, do I look so bad? He ran on seeing me. I think he is the one Ria is in love with. And Ria is waiting for her. - I see. Come on. - Come on. Hey. Wait, wait. Hey, hey, lift. Lift. Hey, hey, lift. Lift. Hey, hey, hey, wait, wait, wait. - Hey, what is this? Will you drop me at Ballygunge? Hey, you? My trip to foreign country was cancelled because of you. My life was ruined. I will not take you at all. I will give you 500. - How much? 500? What will I do with 500? No, no, Madna. 1000. It will take 1000. 1000. - Yes, that is fine. How will 1000 suffice? - What? I can take you if you pay me 1500. - Yes, yes, okay, okay. I will give it. Yes. - Yes, okay. Hey, hey, hey, how can you sit here? There is no place. Come on, come on. Quickly. Hey, Madna. Don't leave him. Take 1500 for sure. Come on. Come on. - Yes. Come on. Ride faster. - Yes, yes. Ride faster. My lover is waiting for me. Ride faster. - Yes, I am going. I am going. Brother. Come on, ride faster. It is quite urgent. Hey, ride faster That is it. That is it. Stop here. Stop here. Yes, yes. Stop here. Stop here. Here you are. Keep the rest, okay? Hey, brother. Listen. I have earned a lot of money in life. But you really love her, right? Go. I will not take money today. This is your gift. I am not married. But we are with people who are really in love. Go. Go to your Juliet. Thank you. - I am leaving. Aunt. - Yes? Where is Ria? - She is upstairs. Who are you? Your son-in-law. Son-in-law? Son-in-law? Ria. Ria. Ria. Ria. Ria. Madhu? - Ria. Where are you? Ria. Madhu? Ria. Madhu. Ria. - Madhu. Come here. Yes, yes, I am coming. I am coming. Ria. How did you go that side? Hey, you have so many windows. I cannot understand which one is the right door. Wait, I am coming. Hey, hey, you will fall down. Come from that side. Oh yes. "Bengali Babu." Ria. Where did you go now? Madhu? Where did you go? Hey, if this a house or a puzzle? I have reached the terrace. Oh my God. Should one have so many stairs in the house? Oh no.. - I don't know where each one leads. Wait, I am coming. Wait there. I am coming. Oh no. - Yes. What was that for? This is for fighting with me over the phone and making me cry all night. Do you know how sad I was? Were you sad alone? Didn't it affect me? Do you know how sad I was? Then why did you say all that to me on the phone that day? You could have told me about your feeling. Monkey. I am a monkey. And have run around foreigner women. I didn't understand that I fell in love with you. But you are educated. You understood. So why did you not tell me that you aren't married?
