Smoking is injurious to health. Smoking causes cancer. Smoking is injurious to health. Smoking causes cancer. Hey, where's Bobby, man? Yes. He is on the way. Please help me. No. No. No. Do you know who I am? You are a bull dog let loose on the roads by your rich father. Your name is Sean. Hey, he knows me. And despite knowing me, you are stopping me? Hey, this is so strange! Wouldn't I try to help a girl from my country when she is in trouble? And in a foreign land? What will you do? Hit me? This is your problem. Hey, you should rather solve the problem. Instead of that, you have come here to prove yourself as a hero. Hey. How much has he paid you.. ..to become a henchman? Let him hit me first. I will thrash him so hard on his stomach.. ..he will lie flat on the ground in merely five minutes. On seeing him, he will get angry to the core. He must be thinking that a boy from another neighborhood is showing his prowess here. On seeing all this, the boy standing behind you must be thinking that.. ..he has already taken money from you but he must thrash. But.. This will prove to be his end. And then the norm will happen. You are a local goon, right? Your entire gang will attack together. Listen. Finish off the matter right here. Try to be a better person. Or else.. Listen to me, buddy. Instead of chasing girls at night with these sidekicks.. ..stand in front of girls during the day with flowers. Who knows? If you are lucky, maybe they can give something in return. Are you happy? Saying that I am happy would be an understatement. This evening and you. On the whole, this is the best phase of my life. Okay. If only we could spend the rest of our lives like this.. ..wouldn't it be great? So what is stopping you? My home. Hello. Hello. What happened? Did you feel upset on talking about home? My home. The place where I was born. The people there and everything else is different, Abhi. It is their daily routine to commit murders. Happiness. Love. They don't know anything about all this. Meeting you and being with you are very memorable moments for me, Abhi. But I cannot go back home with all this. I have to go home alone. That is why I wanted to say that it is better that we don't meet at all. I am not breaking up with you. I am just moving away from you. If I take more time, I wouldn't be able to go back, Abhi. R. K. Institute. Everyone goes abroad for studies. And you have come back to the country from abroad? To study or go backward in life? For a girl, sir. What? Thank you. I am leaving. What.. Get him. Come on. Get him. - Get him. Come on. Get him. Come on. Get him. - Get him. Come on. Get him. Come on. Get him. - Get him. Come on. Hey, what is happening there? - Why are they hitting him? Let us go and see? - Come on. We will go and see. Thrash the fool! How dare you? Tell me. Tell me, fool. He has been creating this hell like drama in the college for the last five years. And the ones who had joined the college with him have become professors. And he is still a student. Tell me. Tell me, fool. Get out of here. Come on. Binu. You have a lot of caliber. What do you say? Right? Yes. You are sitting here and wasting away. What are you doing? Right. You are right. - Absolutely. Yes. You should be the corporation's mayor. You are right absolutely right. - You are right absolutely right. Boys from outside Kolkata come here and get good results. People from outside Kolkata can come here and hit the local boys. - Yes. Yes. Don't people of Kolkata have any respect? - Yes, brother. You are right. Yes, brother. - Dude. Dude. Dude. Dude. Hey, what do you want from us? Come on, get lost. He will take care of what he wants. Come on, let us go and thrash. - Yes, brother. Dude. Dude. Dude. Dude. Dude. Don't give medicines for jaundice to patients with blood sugar. Leave him to me. I will handle it. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. I will take care of the medicines I have to give. I will not leave the swine. Just get out of my way now. Come on. Okay. Okay.. - Hey. Hey.. I can understand all of you are in a hurry. Okay. Let us toss. The one who wins the toss will thrash Indra. Hey, you fool. I will thrash you now.. - Hey.. Wait.. - Hey, Shakal. Don't get too excited, dude. Relax. Cool. Okay. Toss cancelled. Let us play a game of thrashing. The one who wins will thrash Indra. Will you move, fool? - Move. Come on. I am not a fool. I am a player. And.. Let me handle Indra. He has courage, boss. Right? Brother. After this, I have to trust you, right? Brother. Take time and treat the patient, brother. - Yes, yes. I wouldn't go to check him. I will not even look at him. Yes. Yes. -Yes. Yes. Hey, take this bald man to the classroom. Yes. - And teach him a good lesson. Then we will see what is to be done with him. Yes. - Come on. Come on. Thanks, boss. I had a little too much of alcohol yesterday. So the fools thought they can get hold of me. If you wouldn't have been there, God knows what would have happened. What is it? Was it him? Yes, I think it was him.. - It was him. I think it was him.. -Hey, how would they know? You were completely drunk. And so were they. If you hit someone, do you think they would just sit at home and nurse their wounds? That isn't possible. There is a counter attack of an attack. Yes. This should have been remembered by your henchmen. What do you think? We will sit quietly? We know who had come to thrash Indra. If I cannot hit each one and teach them a good lesson.. ..I wouldn't be.. - Tell me. What is your name? Tell me. What is your name? Fool. One should have a name which should make the entire West Bengal scared. If you thrash, the game will be over, dude. You must do something that would make them scared forever. Now consider someone has come to thrash you. Through each and every activity through the day.. ..like while waking up, sleeping, eating and walking.. ..they should think of you. The fear that they might get thrashed is a bigger fear than being thrashed, dude. Newcomer in college? Yes. I still haven't got a hostel. I was in the college ground last night. Today, I will stay on the river bank. What? You can stay in my house. "Free one." Come on. Come on. A lot of untoward incidents are happening these days. If door bell rings, there is no need to open the door. Just tell them you don't need anything. All these salesmen want to make arrangement.. ..for themselves rather than sell their stuff. Got it? Yes. Look. This girl doesn't have any other place to deck herself up. Hey, go inside. Oh, the inauspicious one. Look. He has got hold of someone new today. Come on. Go inside. Go inside. Go inside. Go inside. Don't you understand Bengali? What did I say? Come on. Go inside. So what is it, Keshto? Going to office? Why? Do you think I am going to take a bath? Strange! He is my friend Abhi. Abhi. He is my landlord. Keshto. Mr. Krishna Chandra Singh. Hi, dude. Hello. I was Singh(lion) earlier. I used to growl and make everyone scared. I am vegetarian now. Now I eat vegetarian food and others have fun. As you can see, my name Krishna is there but Singh isn't written anymore. Now I cannot say anything to the goons. I keep my daughter in control. Hey, don't talk too much and send tea upstairs for all of us. Come on, Abhi. - Yes. Hey. No. That isn't possible. I mean I am going to office and your sister-in-law has gone for a bath and.. Father. Father. Father. Father. Shall I get tea? What will you get? - Tea. Well, people blame goons. But goons are not always at fault. Sometimes it is the fault of the girls too. I will thrash you. I will thrash you. I will thrash you. I will thrash you. Abhi. Sleep here. We will sleep in the bedroom. Hey. You lie around here and there in a drunken state all the time. What will you do with the bedroom? Leave the bedroom for him. Tea. - Thanks, dude. Welcome. Listen. There will be an extra meal from today. Brother Bhoba. Has that boy been fixed from today? Yes. So I will take 5000 extra for food and lodging. Why? Why would it be extra? We will stay in the same room. Hey, brother.. -Hey, Keshto. Listen, it is my birthday today. Make arrangement for a loan of 50,000 for me from your bank. Hey.. "Hail the great Lord. Hail the great Lord." "Hail the great Lord. Hail the great Lord." Look, brother. I am only getting slapped again and again. I have bad luck. I am spending from my account for someone else's birthday. And I am dancing. This is what I have been doing for so long and now, I am a pauper. Okay, you are the landlord of the house. -Yes. You should suppress this goon. Why are you so scared of him? No. No. No. No. No. I was like a lion and I did keep him suppressed. - Really? Indra. Hey, Indra. Did you call me, brother? What is this? - Come, mother. Cigarette. - I can also see that it is a cigarette. But how did it come here? No. I mean I smoked in the morning. And when I wanted to throw it, it must have fallen here. Henceforth, if I see a cigarette lying around here and there.. ..I will throw you out of here. If it would have stopped right there, it wouldn't have been a problem. But I am quite soft, right? I thought I will extract some more from him. What is this? A beer bottle. Really? Beer bottle. I thought it is a feeding bottle. This is for feeding milk to kids. I will kill you with this. You were like this? Think about it. Will a young man have lemon juice instead of beer at home? Hey, after all, they pay rent. I thought I will teach him a lesson. Hey. Don't forget you are in Krishna Chandra Singh's house. You are in a dangerous man's house. If you cannot maintain discipline, I will teach a good lesson to you. Hey. Hey, what is this? Oh no.. Oh my God. Hence, Singh(lion) became a cat. Krishna Chandra became a scared cat. Don't be sad. Your glorious days will be back. Right? One day.. - Cheers. Hi. - Hi. Want to dance with the birthday boy? Get ready. Okay? Happy birthday, dude. Happy birthday. Thank you so much. Get lost. Dude. Does someone merely sit and have alcohol on his birthday? Come on. You must enjoy your life. You must get revolution in life. What else do I have at this age except alcohol and hooliganism? There is, dude. There is. There is a bigger intoxication than alcohol. A bigger intoxication? Yes. What? Girl. Take a look around. Lord Krishna. He used to.. Go to the house next to his. Do you know? Yes. - Hello. One second. Just for the girls. Shall we dance please? - Sure, baby. Girl. What do you say? Hello. Let us dance. Come on. Sure, dude. Hi. - Let us go for a coffee? Sure. - Sure. Come on, let us go. Okay. "My wish didn't come true. And my hopes remain unfulfilled." Hey. He has come here. What does he want now? - Hey, Krishna. Take your rent. Rent for this month. You seem unfamiliar. Till date, I had to tell you so many times for rent. And you thrashed me instead of paying rent. Now you are paying me rent on the first of the month instead of thrashing me? What is this? - What? If you would have told me earlier, I could have been at peace. Why? What happened to you? No. Nothing special. I have been transferred. Oh no. Where? Now there is a place called Keshpore in the West of Mednipur. That is the one. - I see. Keshpore? - Yes. I have my house at Keshpore. Your house is in Keshpore? Yes. Where are you going to stay there? Where else? In the bank quarter. I will somehow survive there.. - No, no, no. Why will you stay in the bank quarter? - What? You can stay in my house. Wait. I will call mother right away..- Hey, hey, hey. Don't call your mother and bother your family members. No. I will not listen to anything now. You will stay in my house for sure. That is it. Hey. Brother here. What do you think? I would have stayed in the bank quarter? I knew it right along. I will stay in their house. Hey, he has lived off me for so long. Now I will live off him for some time. I have told mother. You have already told her? What can I do now? I must go there. Hey. - Hey. Get hold of him. - Come on. Thrash him. - Come on, thrash him. No. Let go of me. Thrash him. - Come on, thrash him. Younger brother. Younger brother. Get lost. Younger brother. Hey, younger brother. Come on. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Come on, get up, younger brother. Get up. Come on. Thrash him. - Come on, thrash him. Come on, younger brother. Sit here. Hey, younger brother. - Yes.. Look. Look, I have got him. I have got the henchmen of Dibakar. I will chop him off in front of your eyes today. So.. So that the fire in your heart can be doused. Brother. Brother, look. No! Younger brother! Did the fire in your heart get doused? The ones who killed your son and put you in this condition.. ..will be found out. And I will get each one in front of you and chop them off. What do you say? There is a month long holiday in college. What will you do? Go back to Italy? Italy isn't Mednipore. I cannot go there by train. And.. If I go for a month, it wouldn't be worth it. So what will you do? Let me see. I will go to some place around in West Bengal. I will go for a trip somewhere. No need to go anywhere. You must come with me. Come on, dude. Let us go. Oh God. He doesn't even hesitate. He just takes his bag and leaves? Hey.. Hey, dude. What is this? I think they have sacrificed a goat or chicken because you have come, right? Good tradition. Good. - Forget it. Come on. Come on. It is a huge house. - Come on. How are you, father? I am fine. Listen. The condition of the village isn't good. Don't go anywhere alone. Okay. Oh yes, father. I forgot to introduce. He is my friend. Abhi. Hello, uncle. How are you, sir? What are you doing? - What? Father. Don't mind. Actually he is from abroad. Hey, come inside. Come inside. - Bye, uncle. Come on. Don't you have any sense at all? Aunt. How are you? When did you come? Just now. He is my friend. Abhi. Abhi. She is my younger aunt. Aunt? - Yes. Hey, move. Move. Move. Aunt? No, no, no. I cannot call her aunt. She should have been a little older. No, I mean, sister. Sister would be perfect. I will call her as sister. Abhi. My younger uncle. Come on. Come upstairs. What is it, uncle? You seem very relaxed. No, no, enjoy. Enjoy. All the best. Hey, brother. You? Yes? - When did you come? I came around a week back. My God! You seem so different. Your look has completely changed. Yes? So who changed you into a human being from an animal? My friend. Abhi. Come, Abhi. My friend. Abhi. My sister. Kajal. She is my uncle's daughter. Hi, Kajal. So this is the boy who has changed me from an animal to a human being. Come on, Abhi. Bye. Uncle. He is my friend Abhi. Hello.. You are his friend. Not mine. Abhi. What are you doing? Before getting you here, I should have made.. ..a list of how you should behave with people here. Look, Abhi. Be careful of my father and uncle. Okay? Okay, dude. Come on. Abhi. - Hi. Sorry. Why? For leaving you and coming back. And look, I came to you like a shameless man. Thank you. Why? For your shamelessness. Kajal. I don't believe in the next birth. And according to me, we just have one life. Life is beautiful. If you like this, your life will be made. But do you know something? There is no time to like here. Before we like life here, it ends. You are here. On one hand, I am very happy. But on the other hand, I am very scared for you. No, no. Don't be scared for me. When Abhi is here, then, no fear. Spread our people all around. Where does he go and where does he stay? I want all the details about him. I will behead him and put his head at Goddess's feet on the next new moon night. Rudra. Yes, everything will be fine. Okay, baby. Bye, bye. Hey, Abhi. - Yes? Hey, Abhi. Listen. - Hey, tell me. Hey, Abhi. Listen. Can you tell my family members about Doel at a correct time? Please. Please, brother. Please. Please. Have you been in love for a year? - No. In that case, dude, enjoy your life. Let some more days go by. Marriage would end love. It would be a different chapter. Where? Where is he? Brother. I think he has half of West Bengal's food. Hey, brother Keshto. You are here? Yes. I am here. Can you recognize me? What are you saying? Why wouldn't I recognize you? Yes? Did you have a problem on the way? Well, brother. I think I have got stuck on coming here. Yes, hello. One minute. What do you mean by that? What? - Hey, consider this house as your own house. What are you saying? Yes? Don't hesitate at all, Keshto. I am telling you. Okay. - Okay, talk for some time. I will be right back. Okay? Yes, darling. Tell me. Darling is okay there. I shouldn't have come here. Shona(Darling) indeed. Everyone seems to be.. ..talking only to their darling these days. People have more shona(Gold) in their house even more than Reserve bank. Okay, Keshto. -Yes? You spent a lot of money in taking the transfer. - Yes. How do you feel? Don't ask me, brother. I feel a lakh and a half are wasted. Why? I heard about them in the train. It seems there are two murders on an average in this house. There is competition of corpses in villages. Just imagine. I wanted to take a rickshaw to come here after embarking from the train. When I was about to adjust the seat, there was a bomb inside. - Oh. Imagine. I saw the faces of my wife and daughter in front of my eyes. I am traveling. And there is the bomb underneath. All of a sudden, there is a huge blast.. ..and I get struck by it and vanish into infinity. Can you imagine? Hey, no, no, Keshto. Don't worry about it. - Yes. Go upstairs and change. Yes. Greetings, elder sir. Yes, greetings. What is it? She is my daughter Ranu. She has passed with first division in higher secondary exams. She has got a chance in joint exams of engineering. If you have mercy and tell the college officials.. ..her fees can be arranged for. I had told you, right? Don't educate your daughter so much. Look at yourself. You will make your daughter an engineer. But would you get an eligible groom for your daughter? Don't educate her so much. Come for work from tomorrow with your mother. Go. Dude. Your family is a little strange. They cannot talk with anyone with a little bit of love. Abhi. Don't try to change them like me. I changed because I fell in love, right? But they.. They don't have a reason to change. Come on. One doesn't need a reason to become better. One just needs to have the will to change. What is Sukhdev's wife doing here? I think she has come for money. What do you want? My husband had trusted your family and you. Only because of you. Just for your sake, my husband had to die in the gang war. No. I haven't come here for any compensation. You wouldn't understand the extent of my loss. And I don't want to explain either. I have a request. I have one son. He is very young. He isn't studying and is with you just to take revenge for his father's murder. Please have mercy and explain to him and send him home. Please have mercy. Hey, he is a man. And he has spoken like a man. Would he stay at home like a woman and sulk? He will stay here. Go back home. And what if he is killed like his father? If it is my job to give birth to sons so that they can get into your gang.. ..I don't have anyone who can give sons to me. Hey. How dare you? - Let go of me. Let go.. - Your son will stay right here. I want all the sons of this village. I want to win this war. If I see you anymore, I will bind a rope around your neck and hang you by the tree. Let us go. All day, there are only murders and wars. Is this a house or the abode of Lord of death? What is this.. - Listen to me, baby. What should I do? Look at him. He chats all day. He is talking to your daughter. Hey, tell me. What is this? Hey. With my daughter? Yes. Both of them are having an affair. Look. I think I have just lost my eyesight. Let me set it right. In fact, I told him that if he doesn't change, no girl would come to him. Did my daughter have to come close to him? I am here. That is my biggest fear. Hey. Look. When you weren't here.. ..my daughter was in my control. But when you came here, this problem was created. I could not understand when the goon got hold of my daughter. Of course, my daughter is more at fault. Anyway, my daughter has been sacrificed already. There is no need to worry about it. I just feel bad for my wife. "Where are you? Where are you? Where are you? Where are you? Where are you?" "You are my darling." Elder mother. Elder mother. Elder mother. - Yes? Sister Madhavi had poison. And neighbors have taken her to the municipal hospital. I had told her many times to stop expecting her son back. She has gone mad in her wish to have him back. Now look at her. Come to the hospital with me. Yes. - Come on. Younger uncle. Even I will come for action with you from now on. Okay, fine. Come on. - Where? You cannot take him. His mother is in the hospital. Come on. Abhi. Will something happen to my mother? Abhi. Say something. Why are you quiet? What happened? Tell me. Listen to your mother. Tell her that you don't want revenge for your father. You would stay with your mother's love. Want to leave me and go, mother? Wait and watch. I will always listen to you from now. Trust me, mother. I will not go to their house anymore. I swear on you. Brother Abhi. Please explain to mother. I will stay with mother. I will study again. The fire for revenge in him has been doused. Now if you turn away, neither will you be happy nor him. Take him somewhere else and educate him. Give him a new life. Keep this amount of money. No, dear. You have given my son back to me. I don't want anything else. No, no. This amount is not from me. Elder sir sent it through me for you. Get well soon. I am leaving. I don't understand.. - I am so restless to see you, darling. I am so restless. I am missing you, darling. Please. Come. Come. Come. - "Be free and dance." "Be free and dance." - One minute. I cannot take this anymore. Can I say something? Yes, tell me. Keshto. Your father is too much.. - Listen, I have just one wife and one phone at home. I see. - And I have been trying the phone for the last two days and it is constantly busy. Busy. Busy. Busy. I am missing my wife a lot. I want to talk to her. But this fool has been having conversations for the entire night with my daughter. Yes, darling. - What should I do? Yes, trust me, I love you. Keshto. He is your son-in-law. - What? Talk to him and solve it. You can come here as my wife. We will be happy. - Dangerous boy. I will take him to task. - I will hug you tight and give you a kiss. Now give me one. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Well, I have not spoken to my wife since a long time. I am feeling sad. Can I talk to her? Can you hang up? One minute. Father is asking how you are. Father? When did I become his father? Yes. She says everyone is fine. Anything else? Yes, darling. What? Tell her father is fine too. Father says he is fine. I told her. Yes, darling. -And yet, he will not leave the phone. He will go on and on and on. - Yes, I miss you. I will give you one.. Talk to her. Come on. Yes. This is a huge mess. What is it? So late at night? Forgive me. I thought the people of this house have no heart. But on seeing you, I understood you are great. My husband had to get killed because of you. And that is the reason I always cursed you. Henceforth, I will pray to God that no harm should befall you. You gave me so much of money to bring up my son? I will educate my son and give him back to you. Wherever I might be in the world, I will never forget your favor. For the first time, I heard someone praising this family. And I also know that you are the reason behind this. But when you gave the money, why did you take my name? They are your subjects. They live with faith on you. If a stranger like me helps them, they wouldn't feel anything. But if you do the same thing, they would feel that the family.. ..that they trust would be with them in their problems. Do you know why they come to you? They feel that there is someone to take care of them. Having the capacity to do things doesn't mean you need to control them. Saying that you are with them is one facet of showing how capable you are. Every person in this village can die for you. That is not something to be proud of. Pride would be in keeping them alive. The ones who would die easily for you. Sir. Why have you come? If you would have called, I would have gone on my own. She is my daughter. She has come first in district. And she has got a good rank in joint. She wants to become an engineer. -Yes.. Give her admission in your college. Who can say? Maybe your college will become famous because of her. That would contribute to your well being. You can increase the fees. Sir. I mean.. I wanted to say that the seats in my college are filled. There is counseling going on for the paid seats now. I see. The front door is closed and the donation system is on. Make one seat free from those for her. Sir.. If we start giving free seats like this, what will happen to our business, sir? So education is a part of business now? You should have opened a wine shop. She will come to college from tomorrow. On seeing her, the other girls of the village will get encouraged to study. I will not come for everyone. You can adjust at that time. Listen. Study with a lot of focus. You must become a very big engineer. You must repair the dam after that. I will not pay you at that time. Elder brother. I have got a good alliance for Kajal. The boy stays in Haldia. They will come to see Kajal tomorrow. Wow. You didn't say anything at all? Your studies are over. You must get married now, right? What do you mean? Just because my studies are over, I have to get married? Mother. I haven't seen the boy and I don't know who he is. You have fixed my marriage with him. How nice. At least.. You should have at least told me. Even I didn't know anything, dear. - God. Your uncle got the alliance all of a sudden. Abhi. Uncle has got an alliance for me. I know. And you let it go? At least you must do something. Hey, they are only coming to see you. They are not coming for the marriage, right? By the way, there is one bad day destined for you. Go through it somehow. After that, I am there. Now he is trying to entrap her. But the girl is at fault here as well. Hi.. - Hello. Hello. He is the girl's brother. He is my elder brother. Greetings. He is our younger brother. - Greetings. Greetings. Girl's father. Sit down. - Come on. My name is Shapan Panja. Telkata Shapan. I am sure you have heard my name. There was an officer in the Haldia oil company.. ..whose murder has been filed in my name. Hey, Krishna. Are you going somewhere? Yes. Well, I was going to office. Is something the matter? No. I wanted to say that they have come to see our daughter. Please sit. Oh, I see. I see. You have got young men with you. Haven't the elders of your house come? If all of us leave the house at the same time, we might get attacked. - I see. That is why we don't go out together. Very good. The supply line will be fine. Well, is your daughter still dressing up? Hey, there is no need to dress up. Ask her to come quickly. Now.. - It would be risky for me to stay here for long. I see. What is your name? - Kajal. Kajal. Nice name. My name is Shapan Panja. Telkata Shapan. Come on. Come on, give them tea and all. Make it fast. Hey, Padda. Give them tea. Attitude. Attitude. Hey, Shapan Panja's wife must have attitude, right? What do you say? So how much have you studied? Have you completed tenth boards? Yes? I have done masters of science abroad. Master of S.. Oh no. You couldn't complete the tenth also? Where have you come from? - Haldia. I see. How many cars have you got? How much did you pay? Ten thousand. So many jackals together.. - What? I mean so many men must have had food worth around rupees 5000 for sure, right? So in all, you spent 15000? I like this girl. Set a date and time and let me know. Shall I go? Come on. Do let me know. One doesn't need over smartness but average smartness to get a girl. They paid 15000 to go and 15000 to come. How much? - 30. The money has been wasted. Oh mother, how could you decide upon a fool like that for me? Disgusting. Listen. I had asked everyone to send you abroad to study. But none of us have the right to find a boy for your marriage. What is it? Did you like the groom? I really liked him. He is tall and looks strong. Elder mother. If you like him so much, why don't you get married to him? Oh God.. - Excuse me. Can I come inside this women's gathering? Hey, dear. Come inside. Come.. - Thank you. Oh. So madam, how was the boy? Okay. Tell me, dear. What is wrong with the boy? He is perfect. Perfect. She would not get a better boy than that. But his name is a little weird. I mean.. Shapan Panja. Wouldn't Iter Panja be better? And his pet name? It is even worse. What was that? Tel.. Telkata Shapan. Telkata. I mean we can change the name after marriage, right? And one doesn't need to go to court to change name. People change it anyway. Assume if one's hand is amputated, he can be called Hathkata(without a hand) Shapan.. If he has a sprain, he can be called as Langa(lame) Shapan. And if he is beheaded, he would be.. Galakata Shapan(One without a head). Correct. She is quite intelligent. But if he would have died, there would be no name left. We would have cried for some time. But after that, we would have blamed destiny and forgotten everything. Assume that he didn't die. Assume that only his hand would have been cut off.. ..or if there is an injury or his leg is amputated.. ..and he has to sit on the wheelchair.. ..have you thought even once what will happen. Then even your daughter would have to make her.. ..husband sit on the wheelchair and work like a nurse. Apart from that, he is perfect. Telkata Shapan doesn't have any problem. He is completely refined. All the best. Elder brother. Yes? - I didn't like this alliance for Kajal. Kajal has studied abroad. The boy's culture and her culture don't match at all. How can she spend the rest of her life with such a boy? If the boy would have been just uneducated but innocent, I wouldn't have had a problem. But being a mother, how can I give my daughter to a murderer and a goon? Yes. You are right. Kajal is your daughter. If you do not like the boy, I wouldn't get Kajal married to him. I will look for another alliance for her. Go. Are you with her? Keshto. Although you are a fool, you do have a brain. You are right. You are entrapping everyone miraculously. You are not sparing anyone. You can entrap me too. - I have done that long back. He is such a dangerous boy. I should stay away from him. I cannot tolerate our separation. My daughter has been entrapped by a clever animal. Even your sister has been entrapped by foreign animal. They are having an affair. What? - Nothing. Continue. Fool. - Forget it. Hey. Go and get this repaired. - Yes, brother. Greetings, younger sir. Yes. Going to the village? - Yes, sir. Come on. Hey. - Hey. Hey. Hey. - Hey, Rudra. Drive faster. Get hold of him. - Hey. Stop. Don't try to run now. - Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. - Hey, Rudra. Come on. Come on. - Hey, Rudra. Come on. Get hold of him. - Come on. Get hold of him. Hey, Rudra! Hey. Hey. Hey. Oh no! Fool! Where did you go? I had gone for a haircut. Thank God I didn't go for a shave. Can you imagine what would have happened if I would have gone for one? I would have come back and found out that you are gone. Okay, I am sure the next attack will be from us. - Yes. I will not spare anyone. If I don't kill each one and keep their corpses on the land of the village.. ..I wouldn't prove my true mettle. Correct. I have a good plan. Risk is less. But the amount of gain is more. Yes. I am sure they will think you will attack them with the gang. But you don't do it. And around 50 to 60 years go by. They will get scared. And on the other hand, you would spend a peaceful life with your grandchildren. How is the idea? Yes, Abhi. You are great. Oh, mother. Listen to me. Please. Listen to me. Come on. It would be fun. Trust me. Come on. Elder aunt. Here you are. Please. You can give permission. If you do, everyone will go. I am sure. Please. Please. Please. Okay, dear. Fine. Go and ask your father and uncle. And then, you can. I will be back in a jiffy. Hey, uncle. You have been sitting in the same chair for the last twenty years. Do you like it? I know you don't. Come on, we will go out. All of us are going. Look, you will have a lot of fun. Yes. I am here. Everything will be fine. They had planted their men all around. They wanted to kill us at a place where no one would come to know. Younger uncle. Younger uncle. Listen to me. Younger uncle. All of us have decided to go for a picnic somewhere. I am bored sitting at home. I don't like it. Will you come with us? Please come. I am telling. Please come with us. Please.. - Get lost. Want to go for a picnic? You are flying too high, right? I will cut off your leg if you dare to step out of this house. Come on. Go inside. Hey. Go inside. Come on. Go inside. They have gone beyond limits now. I will do away with their family now. No one from Dibakar's family should be alive. Find and finish each one of them. I can do anything for the betterment of my village. I don't have a problem. But I must go to Borgobhima temple today. You can start work. Greetings. Dibakar has left along with his family to go to Borgobhima temple. His entire family should be finished. Brother. We have got goons from Jharkhand. Yes, listen to me carefully. The women or the children of the household.. None of them should be alive. No one from the family should be alive to cremate them. Brother. Don't worry. You will get their corpses within ten minutes. Hey! Hey! Hey, what is it? Why isn't anyone taking my call there? Brother. I think they have been informed. They are reaching from another way. I will handle it. Come on. Get him. - Get him. Come on. What is it? Why isn't anyone taking my call there? Hey. You have finished everyone, right? I hope no one from Dibakar's family is alive. What happened? Why aren't you answering? Hey, what happened? Tell me. Hey, what happened? Tell me. Hey, what happened? Tell me. My family is safe! Brother. - Brother. What happened? They have got information that we have got goons from outside. And you? You didn't get information that they have got people from outside? We would have come to know if they had got people from outside. He isn't an outsider. He is from their family. Who is it? I know all the people of Dibakar's family Who is this new person? Thank God we were saved on this journey. Or else, no one knows what would have happened. Don't thank God. We were saved because of him. Except Abhi, no one had the capacity to save us from there. Brother. Abhi is in this area. I know. Since the time Abhi has come, the house seems cheerful. He keeps everyone in high spirits all the time. Brother. I feel is Kajal gets married to Abhi.. ..she will be very happy. When you saved me from goons that night in a foreign country, I thought you are my savior. And after that, whatever you did made me feel you are a flirt. And now? Dream maker. Abhi. You have made everyone in this house dream again. You have.. You have made my life, Abhi. I love you, Abhi. Really. I love you very much. Kajal. I always wanted to see you happy. And along with you.. ..I wanted every person of this house to smile. But.. You don't know who I am. - What? Okay. Have you heard the name of Dibakar Sen? Your family shares enmity with him. And I am the son of that very Dibakar Sen. I am not the same Abhi anymore. I am very different now. The character of that Abhi is different. He had a different world. Anita. Yes, tell me. - Go and check that side. It seems very empty. - Okay, ma'am. Biddut. Okay, Ashok. Listen. - Yes, ma'am. I wanted to say that the main arch there. - Yes. That one. Go and check that arch. - Okay, ma'am. Okay. Okay. This is done and that one.. - Ma'am. Yes? The special flowers haven't reached yet. Yes. Abhi will get those. What are you holding? - These are.. Go and decorate these. Please. Okay, ma'am. It took so long to get such ordinary flowers? You.. What do you want? Should I postpone the reception for your sake? Look, mother. Roses and other flowers are commonplace. But these flowers are.. - Let it be. Let it be please. I don't have time to listen to where you have gone. Anita. Now.. I really like your jewelry. - I like your dress. What is your program for the night? - What do you want to do? What sari are you wearing? - Hey, look at this. Hi. - Hi. Hi. - Hi. Hi. Hi. - Hi. Hi. You are looking so cool. Thank you, ma'am. Thank you so much. Yes. What are you saying? Aunty. -Yes? Hey, look there once. The decoration is nice, right? Oh no. I am not talking about decoration. Your son is surrounded by girls. You look superb. - Yes. Come here. -Thank you so much. Superb. Superb. - One minute, mother. No. Come here. - Listen, bye. We will meet again. Bye. Bye. - Bye. Bye. This is the reason I don't get you for such functions. I feel scared. - Go and check that side. Mother. Leave my hand. - No. I wouldn't leave it. I have to keep you aside all the time like a small boy. Why? Am I a child? I am safe. Thank God I don't have a father. Or else, he would have behaved in the same way with me. Thank God. I am safe. Thank God I don't have a father. Or else, he would have behaved in the same way with me. Thank God. Is something the matter? Is something the matter? I have committed a mistake. I haven't told you something. Your father is alive. - Father? When you were two years old, we used to stay in Bombay. During the veneration holidays, all of us had gone to your father's village. Get hold of him. Get hold of him. Father. - Father! Hey.. - Hey! Only one of them has been caught, elder brother. And then, all of them ran away. Not just one. We will kill each and everyone of their family. Come on. Come with us. - Stop. They have killed my father. Why would you take revenge? You will kill their people. They will kill your people again. What will happen at the end? Keshpore and Godbeta will become a huge cremation ground. No one will remain alive. But brother, they don't think of all this. Let them not. We will think about it. We are alive because of the faith on your love. We will not let harm befall your family. Your wife and children are alive because of their love and faith on you. What if something happens to you? You love one family. My family. But I love each and every family of Godbeta. And I want to keep everyone safe and alive. Despite this, if you attack them.. ..you will commit murders of my faith and my love. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go home now. And when I talk to the SP, both of you must stay with me. -Yes, yes. Deba. -Yes? Listen. Wouldn't you go? Where? What do you mean? To our place. Look, nothing has happened yet. But if I leave, there will be fighting and bloodshed again. Not even a single person will be alive. I want to stay here and change them from animals to human beings. I am scared because of that, Deba. In order to change these animals, I hope you don't change into one. Nandini. Don't you trust me? - I do. But I don't trust any of the people who are with you. And yet, I wouldn't leave them and go. Even I cannot stay here. Now you can decide. What do you want? Your wife and child or these people? Drop sister-in-law carefully to the station. I came here so that you are not hurt. But it is true that good people like your father are very rare. You are like your father. Mother. Can I meet father? Yes, come over. The boy has left. He is coming alone. Brother. You are so keen on Anjali's wedding. But will she get married? She has already made four of them leave. -No. No. If she does something of that sort this time,.. ..I will punish her and make her stand outside the house. You cannot do it even if you want. When you look at her face, you will forget everything. You are too much. Oh no. I don't like this. I don't like it at all. Oh no. Leave me. It is enough. I don't like it. Keep quiet. You are speaking rubbish. I have decked you up so much and yet, not a single alliance has been fixed. I am very precious. You cannot give me to just anyone, younger mother. Give me the responsibility to find my husband. What? - You will see. I will get a lot of boys. Hey, forget a lot of boys. They will run off from midway. Don't say that. I do want to get married. But I want someone whose sight should make my heart stop. Tell me. How do I look? It depends on how someone looks at you. If the girls on the road look at you, they will move to the side. - What? They will think where this mad man came from. - What? And if small girls see you, they will move away. Tell me. Listen. It seems your bangles are not enough. Do you need some? - Why? You will give? I will. Tell me. You look a little bit like a hero. I knew it. - You did? That is why when I leave now, I will go out in style like a hero. There is no point of style. A boy is coming to see sister today. Let him come. I will marry her. Are we eloping? Yes. Till half of the road. If someone sees that I have come with you till midway,.. ..they will kill me and bury me here. Why? What do you think? I will sit quietly? So? Take it easy. Did I ask you to die right away? Listen. I have to make this boy flee in the same way as the other two boys. Do you remember? Want to rehearse once? Hey, I will perform well. None of the other four boys believed that we are dating. I had a tough time making them flee. They had gone to my place. I am wearing the new shirt you have given. Everything will be fine. Hey. I think he is here. Go. Listen. -Yes? Ask him first if he is going to our place or not. In that case, don't make him flee. Okay. - We will finalize him. What? Hey, boss. Are you going to the house of Dibakar? Yes. You are going to see her? Please don't go. Since childhood, we are having an affair. This is Godbetar. The pond. The palm tree. Road. Everything stands as witness. Listen to me. A house might break. But united hearts cannot break. If you go back, our love can be saved. Hi. - Hi. Going to Dibakar Sen's house? Yes. - Going to see a girl? Yes. That girl? -Yes, yes. Hi. But the meeting takes place at home. On the middle of the road.. - Why do you want to waste petrol by going to her house? I thought I would settle the matter on the way. Didn't get it? Come on. I will explain. They have an affair since childhood. - Yes. What? Isn't it? Yes. Yes. Everyone around knows it. That river. Palm tree. Road. Everyone. Only you and I didn't know. And in order to say that, they are standing on the road. - Yes. Oh no. - Come on. Now if you turn your car, your petrol and their love can be saved. But bad choice! - Hey. Thank you for telling me. What? Happy? Yes, that is fine. Who do you want? What happened? Who do you want? Dibakar Sen. - Why? I am Dibakar Sen's son. Abhi. Brother. Yes. Who is it? Your father. Father. How are you, Abhi? I am fine. Did you have a problem in the journey? No, no. Nothing of that sort. Didn't sister-in-law come? Fine. - Mother couldn't come. Actually she had some important work. That is why she didn't come. Hey, isn't it the same car? Yes. What is this? - This is the.. It is the same car. He has come after so long. - I cannot believe it is Abhi. I think he has said everything. If younger uncle finds me, he will kill me. I am leaving. - Hey, I will give you one slap. Why? Didn't you tell me you can die for me? Yes. - Come on. Come on. Greetings. Greetings. What happened, Anjali? - What? Why are you looking at him like that? Look at him properly. He is the son of our elder uncle. And she is Anjali. Greetings. Stay away from her. What? Abhi. Yes, father? I wanted to know something. How is mother? She is fine, mother. Does mother still throw temper tantrums like earlier? No, I mean I wanted to say that do you talk about me? Mother misses you a lot, father. I have one drink every day. Since twenty years, this has been my companion. Want one? - No, thank you. What do you do? I am an engineer. Father. Thank you. "Hail Lord Shiva Shankar." "You are the greatest Lord." What are you looking at? No. I was just checking if someone has given you tea or not. I see. That means your work is to check stealthily.. ..if everyone has got tea in the morning or not. Right? No, no. Not for everyone. For the person whose room is nearest. Okay, no one has given you tea yet. I will have tea served by you. Don't worry. By the way, you are in this house.. - Yes? I am adopted. What? I have been adopted by elder uncle. Elder uncle was my father's friend. I was very young then. Father and mother died at a very young age. Elder uncle got me here. Since that time, I have been here. Without reservation. There is no such place in Kolkata, right? A place where one can stay and eat for free. No, there isn't. Because my father doesn't stay there. Hey, brother. Hey, look. Look. Everyone is very happy today, right? What is all this? I mean.. Let me complete it. I will tell you later. Father. I cannot understand anything. I mean.. Is there a ceremony at home today? Happy birthday, my son. Come. - Thank you, father. Thank you, father. Come with me. Come on. Come on. Everyone must come. I have good news for everyone. Since childhood, I have been seeing that there.. ..is a huge celebration at home on this day. Everyone has a feast. I came to know of the reason today. It is your birthday. Today, we are celebrating the birthday of someone.. He is my son. Abhimanyu. Yes. - Yes. Yes. This land isn't mine. It is for the farmers. That is why we have come to you. If you say, they will give it. And if you want, we can give your commission in advance. Do you know who you are talking to? Do you know who has sent us? Rudra. If you agree with Rudra, this bloodshed will stop forever. You will be safe. No one more than me want the bloodshed between the two villages to stop. But that cannot happen at the cost of losing the harvest and farming of the farmers. Okay. We will give them some money too. Some money? They are utterly rustic. They wouldn't be able to take money. And they wouldn't know what to do with the money. If you are done with the talking, have tea. And then, leave. Today, if we leave empty handed, your Godbeta will have rivers of blood flowing again. Hey. What will you do? What will you do? Hey.. - Shankar. Are you done with saying whatever he asked you to say? Now leave. 3500 families have faith on just one person. And you dare to get two or three goons and threaten him? After this, if any of you shows any such audacity.. ..I will bury you here too. Out. Get out. Come on. Hey.. - Hey.. My father is a good man. Hence, you are alive for so long. Forget the last twenty years. Get hold of a new calendar now. Go and tell your boss that Dibakar Sen's son is here. Go and tell them. I have been waiting for this day for the last twenty years. Only for the sake of brother. I would keep praying to Lord to send just one person. One person who would come here and take a stand. I couldn't imagine you would come back and make us so proud. Dibakar Sen isn't scared anymore. He is ready to fight with us. His son has come back. He is.. Making a new plan to kill us. Listen. You have come to the village for the first time, right? Are you having fun? Yes. But it would have been better if mother was here. There is one option to get elder mother here. What is it? - Get married. Her son will get married. Wouldn't she come? Okay. Do you have a girlfriend or not? Meaning? Girlfriend. Take it easy. You can tell me. I wouldn't tell anyone. I did have one. In college. But I think she is married now. Oh no. That isn't love. That is called making a base. I have had a lot of affairs like that. Sorry. Sorry. Okay. Have you decided about the kind of girl you like? Since I am tall, my wife.. - Yes.. She should be tall like me. Tall? What will you do with a tall wife? Make her clean the ceiling fan? Strange. A girl's height should be near the shoulder level of her husband. It can match only then. Okay, fine. Anything else? Educated. My wife should be educated. MA or MCOM. It would be good. How? Would you use the degrees to eat? Listen. If both of you are educated, the marital life can never be happy. There are problems in the family all the time. In order to bring up a child, one must know A for apple and B for bat. And cooking. These three things are enough. Listen to me.. - God has given you a brain. Use it. Some sisters-in-law would be good. Then I can get more affection. I got it. You want to keep all your options open. I thought you are nice. But you have the same problem. Hey, I am right in front of you. Look at me. Why are you looking at someone else? Oh no. He has dashed my hopes. Marriage is giving one's life to another. But before giving it, one must check ..if the person can take responsibility and keep the faith. He should keep both. Dibakar has a lot of empathy for them. From today, he wouldn't feel emphatic towards them. Go. Hey. there is fire. - Hey, there is fire. Come on, come on, get up. Fire. Fire. -Fire. Fire. Come on, run. Run. - Come on. Run. Run. Hey. there is fire. - Hey, there is fire. Come on, come on, get up. Fire. Fire. -Fire. Fire. Come on, run. Run. - Come on. Run. Run. Hey. there is fire. - Hey, there is fire. Come on, come on, get up. Fire. Fire. -Fire. Fire. Come on, run. Run. - Come on. Run. Run. Be present here. They have been doing the same thing for the last twenty years. Sometimes, they murder our people. And sometimes, in order to get hold of the land, they put the houses of farmer on fire. Despite their repeated attacks on us with arms.. ..I have never allowed my people to retaliate. If they wouldn't have come out of their houses.. ..a lot of people would have been killed that day. Hey, no. They got a lot of money by selling the harvest. They drank alcohol and put their own houses on fire. They have an educated boy at home. Maybe he is giving them advice. Maybe if the houses are burnt, they will get money from insurance. Sir. Don't call us here because of the instigation of one person. Or else, we will do something which we don't want to do. Sorry, Dibakar. I know that they have caused the fire. But how would I prove it? I don't know. You are the one who has to do it. Greetings. - Greetings. Greetings. What is this? I thought they will retaliate. But they got scared and came here. He is crying in front of the police. Hey, keep quiet. - Hey. The houses of the farmers are burning. And he has come to the police to cry. If we would have killed the people, God knows whom he would have gone to. - Yes. Hey, are you an animal or a human being? Hey. Get hold of him. - Come on, thrash them. Stop it. Stop it. Everyone, let go of each other. Come on. Come on, leave it. Is this the place to fight? -We will not spare you. Come on, leave. Leave, all of you. Come on. Go on. Even you can leave. Hey. Hey, hey, hey.. - Hey, what is this? Get hold of him. You shout a lot, right? I have come into your area and caught you by the neck. Leave brother.. - Let go of him. Get all your men to my area. And I will come alone. I will thrash right there and bury you. Today, I am just giving a warning. I hope you will remember this. Stop. Where did both of you go? - To the farmers. If Abhi says something, they will get courage. No, no, no. It isn't right to move around right now. There are problems everywhere. You mustn't stay here anymore. Abhi. If something happens to you, I would regret all my life. Go back tomorrow. Okay, father. Who has renewed Dibakar's courage? His son. For the last twenty years, they have been scared of me. If his son stands beside him, the whole village will jump on us. Where does he stay? In Kolkata. With his mother. He has come to meet his mother for some days. Kill him in Kolkata and bury him. Come on. Hey, where are you going? Why? With you. Are you mad? I have not seen two things. Elder mother and Kolkata. The way they are looking for grooms for me, I might get married any day. And apart from that, the people of Gorbata know I am going to Kolkata. Wouldn't it look bad if I don't go? Elder mother and Kolkata wouldn't mind. Go. Go to the balcony quietly. Wave goodbye to me when I go. Elder uncle. I will go to Kolkata. I will meet elder mother. So? He isn't taking me. Abhi. Come here. Listen, Abhi. Don't worry. I will handle it. Abhi. - Yes, father. Take her to Kolkata. I haven't been able to take her anywhere till date. Do my work. Take her. Go. - Yes. Listen, take it easy. Elder mother. You still look great. Elder uncle will go crazy on seeing you. He will fall in love. Let it be. Enough. Say something else. Whom do you want to hear about? Okay. How is everything there? I mean is there any sort of fighting or bloodshed that happens there? Not at all. As long as elder uncle is there, no one dares to pick up any arms. For the sake of elder uncle, there is eternal peace there. You can see when you go there. Come on. I will leave. Elder mother. I will also come with you. I still haven't seen anything here. Don't I have to go home and tell everyone.. ..that I have seen elder aunt's office, chair and table? I will tell Abhi. He will take you out. Come on. - Come on. What is this? Where are you going? Mother. I have a meeting. I have to go. What are you saying? If both of us are not there at home, would she stay alone? Since you are going out, take her out. Mother. I was at home yesterday. Please take her along today. No, no. It isn't possible. Because I have a wedding plan. Mother. Even I have to go out. It is a question of my career. It is a question of my prestige. Now what? Apart from that, I don't want your father to say that I didn't take care of her. Since you are going out, take her along. That is it. It is my order. Go. Get ready. Yes. Who do you want? We are from their village. We had come here for work. We thought we will meet them before leaving. So aren't they at home? No. They have gone out. - I see. They will come back by five or five thirty. I see. If you wish, you can sit here. What? Now.. No, fine. It is fine. Actually there are a lot of us, right? - Yes. Let me do something. We will sit in the tea shop ahead and have tea and all. Yes, yes. - Right? We will be able to see them when they come back. Right? Okay. - Okay. Okay. - Come on. Think about it once more. Will you be able to kill him? If he is alive, it would be dangerous. Yes. Our.. He will kill all of us. Yes. Yes. For so long, have I just passed my time? Get down. Stop. He has gone inside. Listen, brother. - Yes? Some people have come from your village. I asked them to sit. But they didn't sit. They are having tea outside. Hey. Don't go there. Don't go there. He is somewhere there. - Leave me. Don't go there. He is somewhere there.. - Let go. Hey, start the car. Quickly. Come on. Come on. - Let go of me. Leave me. Get into the car. Come on, get into the car. Yes. Hello? Elder mother. Elder mother. Another boy is coming to see me tomorrow. I don't like getting decked up in order to get alliance from boys. Aunt. I love Abhi. Apart from him, I cannot marry anyone. Please explain to elder uncle. Well.. - Trust me, elder mother, I really love Abhi. We have got a good groom. - Yes, he is great. Hey, one left and another one came? If you would have come sometime back, you would have been able to see Anjali's groom. Elder uncle has fixed a very good alliance for Anjali. The boy stays in America and he will take Anjali to America after the wedding. Wait and watch. She will be happy. Staying in a big house or in America will not make Anjali happy, aunt. Anjali will be happy at a place where she will get love. You have found a groom whom all of you like. But you didn't try to find out what her heart wants. Anjali is a good girl. And she needs a man who would understand her heart. Anjali didn't say anything to us. And apart from that, no one else said anything. Elder brother has done whatever he deemed right. Can I say something? Will you give me one chance? Marry me. How are you, sister? I am fine. And all of you? You are here. Now all of us will be very happy. How are you? I am sure no wife has ever punished her husband like this. You were never out of my heart. You were always close to me. And.. That was my will power. Even if I was far away from you, I have made Abhi just like you. I have always kept in mind that there should be nothing lacking. I have filled his life with love. They have a wedding at their place. It wouldn't be a wedding. It will be the last rites. Uday. Listen, don't leave your food. Eat and go. Welcome. Yes, fine, fine. Mr. Sen. - Yes? Greetings. - Hey. Welcome. Welcome. Welcome. I wanted to say something to you. Tell me. All the fighting that you had kept at bay for so long has started again. Your son is the reason. Mr. Sen. - Yes? I wanted to say something else. I wanted to say that they can attack you anytime. I am leaving. Greetings. - Greetings. Listen, I will be back. - Okay. Yes. All of them are together. I will not leave anyone alive. I will teach them a good lesson. Till the time that swine is alive, you wouldn't be able to kill anyone. Listen to me. Behead that fool first. What is this? - Hey, what is this? What is happening? - What is this? Hey, run. Run. Run. - Run. Run. Run. Hey, what are you doing here? Go inside. Go inside. - Come on. Come on. What is happening? - What is this? Hey, run. Run. Run. - Run. Run. Run. What is happening? - What is this? Hey, run. Run. Run. - Run. Run. Run. Elder aunt! What happened, elder aunt? Elder aunt! Elder uncle. What happened, elder aunt? Elder aunt! What happened to you? Listen to me. What happened, elder aunt? Elder aunt! Elder aunt! Get up. All of you. We must take revenge from them today. Go and take revenge. Yes. Come on. - Yes. Come on. Come on. Stop. Yes. Come on. - Yes. Come on. Come on. He will not go anywhere today. I will not spare the people who have killed my mother, father. The time hasn't come. Twenty years. If the time hasn't come in these twenty years.. ..you wouldn't get the right time in the next twenty years, father. Give me two minutes. I will kill all of them. Don't stop him, brother. Let him do his work. Twenty years back, you had stopped us in the same way. Don't make the same mistake today, brother. We will commit ten murders as a revenge for one murder. I am sure I committed a sin in my life to get a son like you. For the last twenty years, I have been staying.. ..alone here so that I could make them civilized. I have taught them. We don't want revenge. We want change. We want peace in this village. But you messed up everything. You shattered my dreams. You have come and made them animals once again. They have tasted blood again. Your mother said that she has made your life full of love. You cheated her. Your mother didn't want you to be a part of this violence.. ..and hence left the village along with you. But you brought the violence back and your mother had to sacrifice her life. If I would have known that on your arrival, there will be violence here.. ..I would not have given birth to you. Not at all. Go. Before anyone else loses something, leave this village and leave all of us. No.. Don't come back here anymore. In fact.. In fact, don't come even when I die. No.. Abhi. Don't go, Anjali. Stop. I cannot give you to that violent man. I will not let such a big harm befall you despite knowing everything. Today, for him, his mother died. Tomorrow, he might kill you. He had come to this village as a guest for two days. Let him leave like a guest. On hearing father's words, I was very hurt. But he told me the truth. If I wouldn't have gone, none of this would have happened. And then, I met you. Another broken heart like mine. I came to know from you that nothing has changed yet. I thought that whatever has started because of me should end with me. That is why I came to this house with your uncle in order to decorate your world. This is enough, Abhi. No. Don't stay here. But don't think.. ..that I am saying this because I know I can never get you. I am saying this because I love you. Please. Please go away, Abhi. Please. No, Kajal. I am not going anywhere till the time my work ends. Nowhere. Abhi. I wanted to say something. I don't know where you have come from and for what have you come. But all of us want you to be the groom of this house. Although she is the daughter of our family, she isn't like us. She has studied abroad and knows what is right and what is wrong. If you have no problem, let your parents know. I will talk to them. "King. Greetings to you. Greetings to you. Greetings to you." "Greetings to you." You are amazing, boss. You have entrapped so many of them. And they didn't even come to know about your moves. Hey. I know you will invite me for your wedding I know it already. This wedding cannot happen, Keshto. - Why? What is wrong? Who is stopping it? I am their enemy, Godbetar's Dibakar Sen's, son. What? You have won everyone's heart in this house. Everyone is talking about you all day. Except one. If you have to win my heart, you have to be someone I like. You must douse the fire that is burning in my heart. That Gorbetar's Dibakar Sen's son has to.. You have to murder his son. I will give you everything that I have. Won't you understand ever? The boy that has snatched your sleep.. ..is no more. The boy who has come inside your area.. ..and held you by the neck and picked you is no more. He is dead. He cannot kill human beings anymore. He knows how to love human beings. And with that love, he has come to you. That boy is standing right in front of your eyes today. Dibakar Sen's son. Abhimanyu. Fool. Come on. Uncle. Move away. Uncle. What are you doing? Hey. Hey! Uncle. Stop. - Uncle. He is Dibakar Sen's son. He is our enemy. He will be our son-in-law? The son-in-law of this house? He had come to kill all of us. Let me see who saves you now. Fool. I am alive only to kill you, son of a swine. You had come into our jungle to kill us, right? Today, I will kill you. Get up. Want to be our son-in-law? The son-in-law of our house? Uncle. Uncle. Ask uncle to stop. Let me see how you will be the son-in-law. Brother. Please say something to him. He is your friend. I will kill you first. And then, I will kill chop your father into pieces. If I come back to my former self for ten minutes,.. ..only the windows and doors of this house will remain. Not a single person will remain. You have separated me from my father. I didn't say anything. But my mother? What did my mother do? You killed my mother? And yet, I didn't get into the house with weapons. I had got love. Love. For how long shall the villagers cry for your sake? This man has left his house. He has left his family. Do you know for what? So that your people and you can stay in peace. You have taught everyone how to kill. And I? I have taught everyone how to love. If I start using this once.. ..no one would be able to use it better than me. In that case, only this will be left here. And no one will be left. If possible, love people. You will see that a lot of your pain will go away because of love. Hey. Hey, listen. If you feel that by killing me, your enmity will be over.. ..then get up. Get up. And come and kill me. Kill me. Finish your enmity. Stop. You say that he has come to this house to finish us all. So when their people chased you to kill you, why did Abhi save you? Till date, everyone was scared of Kedarnath's family. Have you ever seen anyone loving us? And despite being the son of the enemy, he has achieved it. Should we kill him? Younger uncle. Younger uncle. He hasn't asked for anything special. He didn't want to kill us. He didn't ask for our property too. He didn't want to be the son-in-law of this house. He has only asked us to love human beings. And we will give him that, uncle. We will change ourselves. We will let him go back to the place of love. Stop! Father! He wants everyone's well being. He loves everyone. Don't harm him. Or else, we wouldn't be able to be happy. Even you will be handicapped like me. Not only can the people of Gorbetar love people. Even people of Keshpore can love people. There was a war going on for so long. Now there is only peace. For so long, I had left you so that I could maintain peace. But I didn't understand that no one except you can fulfill my dreams. I had thought that if one gang leaves violence,.. ..another gang would leave arms as well. And you had thought that if there is no change in one person.. ..even the outside world wouldn't change. You are right. I was wrong. I thought you didn't deserve love. You don't know how to love. I am again wrong. You are again right. Forgive me. - Father. Father. Don't do that. Why? If I am wrong, I wouldn't have any shame in accepting my mistake. It is not wrong. Anyway. Go. Go to Anjali. Are you still sitting here to make boys flee? The groom took some time to come. But yes, the auspicious time for the marriage hasn't run out. What do you say? Dude. It hurt. Love me.
