What is this world, Otilia do tell me .. Nothingness makes jokes like a loitering demon. What is this world? What is it, what is it? Bucharest Cinematographic Studio presents FELIX AND OTILIA Based on George Calinescu novel "Otilia's Enigma" My dear cousin, Don't get me wrong I call you the same as when we were kids... "cousin"! After all, for the feelings we have for each other it's better that we're not really relatives. Forgive me for not writing to you for so long. But you also forgot and left me in this provincial town alone with my thoughts and the misfortune that befell me. My father, which you may not remember, because it's been many years since you've been here... Well, this man died in his prime. We are all insignificant beings. If even a doctor can't figure out his condition in time... If he can't take care of himself... Now I don't even have a father, I'm absolutely alone and I find relief in books and study. Forgive me, but I still don't understand your kinship. Are you cousins? In a way, yes, through the alliance. - And when is he coming? - Soon. I can't wait to see him again. I corresponded with him all my high school years. Now he should be a real man. I also chose medicine. First of all, I'm passionate about it and then, this was his most vivid desire. After the mourning, I will move to the Faculty of Bucharest. Then we'll be together all day. You will show me the city, as a poor provincial I am. Uncle Costache became my guardian, too. My poor father kept to the last breath his deepest trust in this man which I hardly know and who is also your adoptive father. Uncle Costache! Uncle Costache! It's me, Felix. I'll take the ladder up...to the attic. Mr. Giurgiuveanu lives here? Uncle Costache! Uncle Costache! Nobody lives here! - But Daddy, it's Felix. - Is he? Take your suitcases and come up! Don't you really recognize me? I am Otilia. She's... Otilia. Aren't you glad? We haven't seen each other since we were little. He is Felix. So, you are Mr. Felix, about whom Miss Otilia spoke so much to me. He is the son of Dr. Sima from Iasi! From Moldova... But you're a really a lad! - He will start the college, Aglae. - Yes? - Sure... My respects, ma'am! She is aunt Aglae, my daddy's sister. How could he know me? When his mother died, he was small. I haven't seen him since. Do you remember him, Aurica? - No. She is cousin Aurelia. - How's our game going? - I have no idea. - Costache! - Yes... - If you play... play! - Play... - And where will the boy stay? - At us. Oh, yes? I didn't know. - Felix has... - Are you organising an orphanage? Felix has his income. Otilia will have someone to have fun with. What do you say, Pascalopol? He has his income. - Isn't that right, Daddy? - Yes, yes... he has. - And you will manage it, Costache? - He has his income. Mr. Felix, what are you going to study at the University? - I would like to study medicine. - Son of a doctor, of course. - I understand you, very nice. - That was my father's wish. Doctor... Insecure job, looking for clients. I'm out of luck at Dominoes today. A good, hardworking doctor earns very well today. For that you have to be very smart. An orphan must quickly make a career out of it. He musn' t be suported by the others. What a beautiful ring! I have not seen him. - Do you like it? Please take it! - It is superb! Daddy... isn't that beautiful, daddy? Take it, he gave it to you! - It's not nice to take the man's ring. - Mom, if she brought it for Otilia... Mr. Pascalopol, why don't you get married? It's not a convenient question, don't you think? Maybe my time hasn't arrived yet, Miss. You surely are the idol of the fairer sex. Have you never had a great passion? Has a woman never loved you? - Fair sex exists only in pictures. - I have a picture of the car. I give it to you... You think you are a handsome one. - I really am. You did not answer my question, Mr. Pascalopol. What should I answer, Miss? At my age I no longer have such concerns. I know who you come for, you just don't come for me. If you love her, why don't you marry her? You're not good, Miss Aurica. A card... You have to give a card. - You're talking stupid. - Mom, I'm talking about what I see. Bad cards. Let's play roulette! There you will lose... You will win more money. Aren't you going, Simion? I don't like to play. It's mine, it fell from me. My pockets are ripped. - What, what? - My pockets are ripped. Look! Aren't you ashamed, Costache? How's your money? - My pockets are.. - They fell from Pascalopol. Sit! It doesn't matter, it's his. - I saw it! - Ripped pockets... I have. Otilia, but maybe Mr. Felix would be hungry. Give him something to eat! Oh, my, how confused I was! How I forgot... We have nothing to eat. Is there anything to eat in this house? There is nothing, don't you know? But don't you eat with Mr. Pascalopol? Look, I found it. I only have this. You have to eat. The Bank has closed. Thanks! Costache, don't you have some money, so I don't have to go home? I don't have, darling. Lady Aglae, I'll give it to you. - No, no... But why not? Take them from him! All right... We'll see at the end. Come on, put it on. What did you say, Miss Otilia? 27... Listen Pascalopol, you play or not? I see you're having fun with the girls. Simion, why don't you go to bed? - Go to bed... - 27... - Costache... you play on 27, too? - I'm going to sleep. - OK, come on... But you didn't win, what do you want? But I lost ten... Since you complain all the time, I will loan with interest a thousand lei that I received today from someone. Well, that's... what an idea. Otilia, maybe Mr. Felix wants to sleep. Sure. Dime over dime... What's that? You are sleepy? You want to sleep. Come on! God, I don't know where to put you to sleep. We forgot to prepare a room for you. Tonight you're going to sleep in my room. Come on! I met Mr. Felix's father. - He's from Iasi. - Yes, Yes. Did you know him? - Of course. He looked a little like him. He was a very kind man, hardworking and ambitious. His poor mother was a sick woman all her life. He's young... he will manage. - Costache... - When you're young you can handle it. - Yes... I need to talk to you like a sister. - Yes... - Because I see you're not foresighted. - But what's the matter? Well, from now on we are old and we don't have much to wait. - Wait for what? - For Heaven's sake! But death is coming! Whose death? Wow, Felix, I don't know where to make you sleep. I'm going to ask my daddy. You're waiting for me here, right? - You will not get mad, will you? - No no. I caught you, you stole. - I'm not cheating... What's wrong with you, Stanica? Relisor, mother-in-law, Relisor, don't you understand? - I'm sick, I'm seriously ill. - What's with this handkerchief? Wet it mother, wet it with cold water to put it near my heart! - Are you sick at heart? - Yes... and I kind of suffer from the heart and feel. Get out of there with your heart disease! You start again with nonsense? But how come? I haven't heard from you yet. I'm sick, the doctors don't think I will live much longer. I kept the disease hidden so as not to bitter Olympia. Not reveal her dark future. I was noble, but you didn't cherished me. The grieves worsened my illness. - What really happened? Relisor, my baby, my angel... Don't you know, mom? He fell out of bed. He's gone. The child struggled. Maybe he was sick. What are you saying? He was very healthy! He was left alone in the room, fell on the floor and died. Olimpia, I'm very mad at you. There has never been such a shame in our family. You had to think hard before you had a baby. You've been together for a year... and you, Stanica... - Yes, Mom... - You don't want to get married. Well, Mom, Stanica runs all day, poor one. These days, it is hard being a lawyer. Someone promised him a job, but so far... Maybe Mr. Pascalopol will want to find you something with his relations. I'll try. Look, Mom, I don't understand why I'm being wronged. I'm the eldest of the sisters, so please give me my share. I'm not asking for anything, just for her. Simion is to blame for this whole business. I can't convince him at all! What do you say, Mr. Simion? I don't give anything! She has a husband, let her husband take care of her... her husband! Let the husband take care of her! - Sit down! Sit down here! Drink some water! Sit down, drink some water. Hey, Felix, did you fall asleep? Come with me to show you the room! Let me show you the room... But what do you have in, that it's so hard? - Books, books are heavy. Books. He has books... Dear nephew, you can sleep here until tomorrow morning. Or you can stay as long as you want... if you like. Good night! - Good night! - Good night! What are you doing here? Aren't you afraid? What if he catches you? Is it good? Do you like it? A white mouse with a black tail. I was sitting by the sea, and I was warming up in the sun... Did you sleep well, Felix? Come on, let me show you your room! - It's done? - But I don't know... If you knew Felix was coming, why did you change Otilia's room? and Otilia's room in Felix's room... To confuse me more, and so I can't sleep anymore. If I were your maid you wouldn't run me so. My poor legs, I can't stand it anymore. All day long I'm in a hurry. - Did you fix the room? - I fixed it, I told you again, deaf man. Well, I'm asking you because I know you're slow witted. It's ready, Felix! I was sitting on the beach and I was warming up in the sun... Uncle! Uncle Costache! We're changing rooms. Why didn't you turn off the light? - Is that him? - He's Felix, Marina. Look, this is your room! You didn't even have one at your mother. This is your bed. This is where you put your boots. You put your clothes in the closet. This is your writing table. Others have written here. But what's this? Look, your room will be warm, I lighted the fire. I also made you some tea. Here's the night pot. Look, the window! Don't try to open it, because it's stuck! This is the laundry room. Why do you need so many books? But we won't eat today? I don't go to the market? What do we do? We will see... I ate... What are you doing? Don't you hear? You don't give me some money? I can't feed you with wind! I don't have money. Here are 5 lei. Okay, but I didn't paid the baker for the last two weeks. - Felix! - Yes? Felix, give me 5 lei! I don't have it now. Yes... What do I do with the butcher? Daddy, what are you doing here? - I showed him the room... I leave him to you, Otilica, keep him company. - Did he ask you for money? - No... Take these, I don't have any more! Don't you ever get bored? I do. Sometimes I feel like screaming and then I take revenge on the piano. You know, I signed up for the Conservatory. But I'm not determined yet. I would rather go to drama class. I asked Marina to iron your shirt. I'm going to remind her because she's kind of forgetful. Come on, Alexander! Felix, I'm waiting for you in the garden. And beware of Aurica! She is trying to get married. - What is the young man doing? - Felix? He feels good. He begins the courses. - Are we going to the seamstress today? - She brought you new magazines from Paris. I will be the most elegant in Bucharest. What are you doing? What do you read? - A book of... Miss Otilia. - You didn't go out. Otilia goes out every day and late at night. She also comes to Mr. Pascalopol. I know. Instead I like to stay at home. I saw you so lonely in the garden and I thought maybe you want to come to me. Felix, you know my father and Titi. You won't refuse me. With pleasure. - You know, I make some great cakes. I'm an expert. Let's eat cakes. We are alone... How are you feeling at uncle Costache? - I'm feeling very well. Really? But you, who are so alone, without parents, should stay with a more settled family. To make you feel at home, right? This is my palace. Sit down on the bed! Look! The pillows are made by daddy, the paintings by Titi. Isn't he talented? Don't you think he's modern? - Yes, very modern. - Do you want some cakes? Help yourself! - Are they good? - Very good. I made them. Delicious. But take a seat! But where is Mr. Titi? Titi is downstairs. He works... he paints. Does he paint? You know, I want to ask you... when you'll come again, don't come on the front door, but on the gate. It's better this way, the people talk. When someone sees you with a man, you compromise yourself. I had a girlfriend, who received advances from a young man, whom she thought he was a serious person. They received him in the house, they all agreed and... The young man didn't keep his promise. Yes, what you say must be very true, but... I have no experience. - Why not? - No. It's great that you told me all this. I could have hurt you without realizing it, but I will never come again, you wanted to... Please don't leave, Mr. Felix. What does it matter if people talk? I think there's someone at the door. It's Titi. It's Titi, my brother. Felix Sima. I'm glad to see you. I saw all your paintings. They are extraordinary. - Do you also paint by nature? - Only by models. What book is that? Can I see it? Yes. - He has beautiful paintings. - Can you borrow it for a day? - If it's only for one day, sure. - Let's go! Our name is Tulea. That's our name, don't you know? Tulea. - But Dad, you've known each other before. - Did you show him the pillows? - Yes... - Welcome, Pavel! But sir, my name is Felix... Sima. - Did you bring the keys? - I don't know what keys are you talking about. Pavel, change at Costache, the money... 30 silver coins. and buy me bread, lots of bread, because I need to eat more. My daddy is so, quiet all the time, doesn't say a word. Today he had an argument with my mother. He said she gave him vinegar instead of tea. When you come to see me again, I'll prepare for you snowballs. What happened to you again? His name is Felix. Shame on you, sinner, don't talk! At the table you gave me only vinegar to drink. What vinegar, are you crazy? If it had been vinegar, you wouldn't have drank it. You gave me vinegar ever since the signs appeared in the sky. Thank God, I fed you like (the bees feed) a drone for years, without having any joy from you, and now you're telling me that I gave you vinegar. The Lord gave me his beard... You'd rather have had a haircut than being like this. Julius Caesar stole my gloves and you stole my money. Did I steal your money? You scattered them with women. They brought you like this. Hmmm, I stole his money... Other people of your age work and run, they don't sit like drones. You tormented my life, you bastard! you're just talking nonsense... Christ became grass and the chickens ate Him. My Relisor! He talked, he called me "father". It's obvious that he couldn't live. Such geniuses are rarely born. He spoke well, he addressed to me. Oh, my God... Relisor was only 2 months old, how could he talk ?! His was talking, mother-in-law. He addressed to me. - My existence is shattered. - But calm down, man! You're a grown up man You will have another, for Goodness sake! -We'll have none, none, mother-in-law! - We'll have no more... The house, the dampness killed him. It enters through the walls. - Okay, okay... - Are we still staying long? You are such a stubborn... Let's do the documents! Let's give them the Stirbei Voda house! I don't want them to live among strangers. I don't give anything, she's not my daughter! Lately you are crazy, Simion. I'll take you to the doctor. - Maybe you don't know, but Olympia is not my daughter. - Simion, please understand! - Do you have money? - Where from? She's not my daughter! I'm killing myself here on Relisor's grave... Miss Otilia, wait a minute! Mr. Simion! This way! I'm sorry about the misfortune, but you're not good at all. You're making ... Miss, Mrs. Olimpia suffer in vain. - She's not my daughter. - Mr. Tulea... As long as Olympia is with me, she's under my protection, do you understand me? and I don't allow you to speak so. If you can't afford to give her a dowry, a damn house, then... You're a thug, I don't give her anything. She's not my daughter! My existence was related to the dear Relisor. He's gone now. I don't really have the means. If it weren't for you, I wouldn't have been able to put him a tombstone. Okay, okay... I'll talk to Simion tomorrow, when he'll be calm. Excuse me! Mr. Pascalopol, it's good to have money to prove you're human. Until I will have it, I have to demean myself again. It's offensive, I know. I need 100 lei. Nobody needs to know, I don't want to humiliate Olympia. When I won't take it anymore, I will blow my brains. Calm down! Let's go! You see them? They're always together. Titi! Come on... The old man fell, I think he died. Come quickly! No more, I can't anymore. I stay here. Let's leave him on the table, poor thing! The keys! He had always been heathy. Marina! Marina, run and call Stanica. Tell Olympia to come too. Tell him to bring the doctor he knows. Go, quickly... and you Aurico, go and take care that no one steals anything! Yes, mom. - Ah, just now it ought to have happened? - Stanica, don't... Why did you carry the bricks? To build a house... what, you didn't have a house? You should go to bed. Why are you sitting on this table? - The keys! - Look at the keys, the keys... You better give them to me. Don't let anyone steal them from you. Ah, he's dying! - Stanica! - Yes, mother-in-law. Stanica, he's very ill. It's very bad... He carried some bricks. And he fainted. I don't have anything to say yet. Sit still and put an ice pack on his head. The attack wasn't violent. Let's see later if he can talk. - Or if he doesn't have any crippling parts. - He must have, because he is old enough. God forbid! Better be dead than someting like this! Vasiliad... What do you say? So paralyzed, can he still live for a long time? - That depends. - Vasiliad, be the person I know. Don't confuse us. What do you think? Will he still live or he will die? Let's know what we do. - It depends on the constitution. - Damn this medicine of yours. You don't know anything for sure. Costache, where's your money? We must buy you some ice. - Give him the keys! - No, I don't want ice. He's a crook, I know him. But Costache, you need money for the doctor. I have no money to pay him! I don't want a doctor, I have nothing. Go away! - Otilia... - Yes, Dad. There's a wooden box in the locker from the living room, take it! You don't give me the keys. You leave the money in anyone's hands, as if I weren't your sister. What a shame, Costache! Keep this towel on your forehead. I have nothing, leave me alone, I'm not sick. - Bricks and planks... - I'm building a new house... You make the house... for whom do you make the house? Don't you have a house? House... new house. The old man is devious, he loads up the expenses. It's Otilia's money, I want to let her something too, a restaurant. A restaurant... you throw away your money for the restaurant. You have two others. Do you think everyone lives in a pub? You are not sane. Here is a "franc", that's all right! We also must eat. A frank is good, good... What should I do with this one? What should I do with this one? You need money for the doctor, for the doctor. - No... - Leave it, old Costache, I'll take what is needed! Look, that's all. Enough for the ice and the bag. I don't want a bag, you bastard... Vasiliad, I'll give you 10 lei because you're our doctor, you're not going to rob us now. - All right, I want the box... - Give him the box. Fuck it! Vasiliad... go to the pharmacist in Rahova! You know him. Tell him that Mr. Ratiu asked him to lend him a bag! Here's a coin to get some ice. Listen! You don't buy anything! After all, Mom, what are we doing here? It must be three o'clock, no one has eaten. Uncle Costache can stay alone. There is Marina, there is Otilia... Ah, Otilia, Otilia... This is my brother's house and I'm his only sister. Do you want some strangers to guard him? She went to call Pascalopol. Mother-in-law, everything is all right, but I'm hungry. Do you want me to stay with him, being hungry? Bring quickly something here! What, you don't have nothing in the house, dear? You don't cook? - No, we're not cooking. - You are a crook.... Let's see what's here... These are from Pascalopol. Genuine Sibiu salami. - What is this? - Oh, let's eat too, mom... My God, why are you all hungry at this hour?! Eat then, if you want! What are you doing, Simion? You eat the cheese with all the crust? One of the best Bordeaux... What a taste, what an aroma... What are you doing with these little scumbags? Bring larger glasses to taste the wine! Cut the salami thicker, to feel when you bite! Too much food damages Of course from a certain age. Salami... I still have about ten years of my normal life. Then no more food, no more women... How do monks and nuns live? Pungasule... I once guarded a man for three days and three nights until we all became exhausted and the old man still didn't die. Yes, he was serious, he had cancer. Doctor, come and give him an injection, maybe he wakes! He's dead, can't you hear, can't you see? The soul is so strage thing! Tell me what that soul is? It's breath, soul... "Anima", as the Latins say. Simion! You have a soul, you breathe. You don't breath anymore, we take you to the trash. Simion, you're getting sick! You ate two pounds of cheese. Let Felix, who is a physician, tell us what is the soul. - Please... - When I was a student... Mom, we didn't manage to grab a peach, too. Please, I want to take a little blood. I'm sorry I don't have my phlebotomy rod. Damn it, Vasiliad! Right now when we are eating? He has no blood and you want to take it. Listen, Uncle Costache, he wants to take your blood. - To suffer... - Yes! - He wants to. We know better what we got to do. You, old Costache, are gentle, even harmless. Others do ugly things. I met a magistrate, who climbed through the chimney on the roof and sang: Glorify the glory of the country, sound the trumpets... He moved his arms as if he was flying... Mr. Pascalopol... How are you, old Costache? Better? Should I change your compress? It's an unbearable heat for a sick person. Why don't we take him to his room? The thugs are stalking me to steal, to force me. I'm not dead yet. It's all right. Relax! I was just with Dr. Stratulat when Miss Otilia informed me of the accident. Do you allow me to invite him inside? All right, but Dr. Vasiliad saw him, didn't he? Another opinion won't harm him. Well... Dr. Stratulat is a university professor. Please, Doctor! Here you go! This way, please! Why did he bring the professor? Was it really necessary? He's the patient. If Mr. Pascalopol pays... A little consultation, old Costache. I want to go to paint. I am very far behind. Mom, let's go. What are we doing here? - It's late and look, Dad is asleep. - You are right. Just breathe! Accident well endured. It's out of the danger. - Can he get up? - He can get up. It's okay, didn't I tell you? He is very healthy! Isn't it so, old man? Crook! - Good evening! - Good evening! - Good evening, Uncle! - Go to the table! - How are you, uncle Costache? - Well, thank you. Enjoy your meal! - Felix... Felix, we're not cooking now. It's a futile job for Marina. You can eat in the city. I put the money next to you. You signed for them. But where are you going to eat? - I don't eat much in the evening. I'm going in the city tomorrow, too. - And where will Otilia eat? Well, Otilia eats with Mr. Pascalopol. - Apples... - Leave the apples, I will gather them! Uncle, how could a girl to go out like this... Otilia is free! And you can eat out. Nobody stops you. Good night! Don't forget to turn off the light. Light costs money, light... Otilia should marry Pascalopol. That's what she should do. Costache! 1, 2, 3, 4, 5... it's all right. I heard you published an article in a French magazine. That's it? - Yes. Give it to me... Bravo, bravo... But it's kind of bad paper. - Yes... - You'll become a scientist. A doctor of theory, not a practitioner like me. You go tnere, I'll take you. But what do you do in the afternoon? Yeah... look, I just wanted to tell you. I also have an old relative who has to do some injections. Do you think it's possible? Come on, let me lead you a little. Sure, don't be embarrassed. Give me the address! I make injections in exchange for ridiculous amounts. On this occasion, I see where you live. - I have nothing to write. - Here's a pencil, write with it! - Yes, thank you! - I'll give you some paper... Yes... Antim. Antim Street, 12. A large gate. Great, yes... Goodbye! - Good luck, young man! - Thanks! Come on up, Doctor! We're going to Obor. Today is St. Agrippina. I kidnapped you for a visit. It will interest you. All this was Agrippina's, and now she rents the attic of the mill. I had very rich relatives and now I'm a miserable when I could be a millionaire. - Did my cousin Panait come, Vasile? - Only the lady came. When I was a child, the yard was full of flour carts. Boo! Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, Happy birthday... "Kiss your hands", Aunt Agrippina! How come this smell of bread? It's like I was taking out the bread from the oven. - What do you think? I brought you traditional pretzels. What can bring you a miserable like me ? Look, some nuts. Let's see who else is around... Let's see who's left of our old family. - How are you, girls? - All right, Uncle. But why don't you come to us anymore? I can't, darling, I can't. My life is going through crucial moments. Here is Luci, and the pretty Lia... and the tall Lica. Do you like the lad? You like him... You always go through decisive moments. Come at the factory, Costica will find you some work! Maybe God will help me to break trough. What's that smell of perfume? What do you use? - Here's what. - Give it to me! Stanica, are you crazy? You only use a bit of that! Surely, what do you care? You're playing with money, fuck this life! Ah... if I grab the gold vein, I'll bathe in champagne. Aaa... here is Lili, too. Aunt Agrippina, why are you so crowded? Can't you get rid of this junk? That's how the things used to be made. Allspice... Aunt Agrippina, I would eat that Greek food with allspice. What food? What food... The one you cooked when we were kids. You need minced meat without veins, without bread crumbs or eggs, as for sausages. Put the finely chopped garlic, salt, a lot of pepper, paprika, crushed enibahar and flour as cover. What was it? I prepared this food with mutton, Stanica. Mutton meat, of course, left to marinate for three days... Well, today they don't eat ram anymore, but in our time the ram... And how good were the eggplants with cinnamon. Noo... There are good. Stanica remembers well, that's how our grandparents cooked. Aunt Agrippina, what are you doing with so many cups? Give me two to show to my descendants how the world used to drink coffee. What do you think, Stanica? Only these remained. Be healthy! Give me some money, because I didn't come by foot! I came by coach and I spent my last money on Aunt Agrippina's pretzels. - How much should I give you, Stanica? - You? What, you have money? Your father is severe with you, let me see your bag! Look here, she has! Yes, yes, yes... Big mess, life is hard. This is my family. Tough like granite! Let's go! Kiss my hand, aunt! I wish you to bury us all! Goodbye! Come on, my dear! I'll go too... Goodbye! Kiss your hands! Bye, I kiss you! Do you have room in the carriage, Toadere, to take us too? I have, of course... What a cute boy! I agree that the girl should bear children. That's it... Ah, what a wife would be a girl like that! A greek woman, with no whims, healthy. and how rich is this girl.. God, why did you make me uncle !? Well, what do you say, Felix? It's a deal? I don't understand. Cunning boy! He's going to be a great scientist, he knows a lot. But, Toderita, why don't you throw away this misery? The mill, the sugar factory... There are other material goods... moral goods in this world. - Yes, yes... - Stop it! Let's have our own Eminescu (greatest romanian poet) in the family, dammit! The world is getting thinner, is evolving. The boy is unique, from a cultured family. His father - God forgive him!- was a doctor. What do you say? We have a deal? Little vixen, she liked the boy. Now he should like her, too She is very pretty, but... Let it be, we don't have to hurry. Come and see us once. - We will come. - Yes Yes... You like him, don't you? She likes... We will come, of course. Come on, kiss the girl's hand! Goodbye! We'll come to visit you, maybe tomorrow night. So, come on! Will you come, yes? Ehh, it can do no harm. You Toderita, give me quickly some money! I have few lawsuits... I want to drink, too from a senator's diary. Come on, let it go! Yes.. He prepared it before... He throw away the hundreds as I would throw away a coin. He don't work for them. Do you want us to come in, Mr. Felix, because we have something else to arrange... for which you will thank me. But I don't understand this marriage proposal What was that? You like Otilia anyhow. It's okay, we'll give her to Titi. If the girl wants him. My wife have such stupid relatives! See? This building is owned by your uncle, Costache. Old Costache? Yes. A chic restaurant and beautiful girls. - John! - Right away! - Is the boss here? - Shall I call him? Yes, but first, tell him to bring me the best! All I ate today was a pretzel. Come on! - Yes, sir, right away! Is nice here, isn't it? Nightclub. Great businesses are concluded here. One like this, and I don't need to be a lawyer anymore. Stop being a child, don't be bitter! Do you think I don't see that you're thinking only of Otilia? There are many as Otilia! Come on, drink! Ah, how beautiful is the youth! Listen, tell me the truth, did you have sex with her? No? Seriously? You are so inexperienced! Look, my Olympia... I respect her, I adored her. She has... I'm telling you in confidence, a gorgeous body, exceptional courtesan qualities, but it kind of bores me. Aaa... Georgeta! How are you? Glad to see you! How are you, dear? Felix, let me introduce you to Georgeta! How are you? But who is the young man? - Don't you know? He's my relative by marriage. Yes? He'll become a great scientist, you know! - Aren't you taking anything? - What's your name? - Felix. And... what? - Sima. - How funny! I've never met so far a medical student. Good girl! Stop it, brother, with "cool girl", all you can say is "cool girl"! She is divine... General Pasareanu, a fat one, is crazy about her. Pour me, too! You're starting to spoil yourself Strong wines... You're going to get drunk. I can manage. - Are there beautiful girls at university? - Not always ugly. - But how? The beautiful girls like you... don't go to work for so many years to make a career. - Do you think I am beautiful? - Rather. I would like to kiss you. I saw Stanica when he beckoned you. I heard him say, "Go on, don't be a sucker!" or so. Have you never been with a woman? How delicate you are! Are you always like that with women? - I have to go. - Stay a while! You are very beautiful! Have I told you before? - You told me. -Who is the old man behind you? Uh, my general, didn't you know? I have a general. You behave very classy, if I may say so. Not only I allow you, I even enjoy it. - The coffee is cold, I have to make another one. - No need, I like it cold, too. - Yes... do you smoke? - No. Tell me the truth, that Otilia is so beautiful? Do you love her very much? You're offended... No, but I don't like you to talk about her like that. You see? I'm jealous. I have to go, I have to learn. I'm preparing for the exams. I'm so sorry you didn't want to get some jam. It's very good, I learned at school. You know, I am not such a fool and uneducated girl. Here is your tie! - I still think Otilia is a beautiful girl. - She's a serious girl. Yes? If you say so, it means she's a serious girl. Then I let you love her. But you can come to me again. Look, the key! Take it! It's yours. You know? The general promised to marry me. There would be another way to get away with it. To become an artist. The artists can afford to be a little carelessly sometimes. - I have talent, don't I? - You are very pretty. Your sincerity makes me love you more. Only this? I'm sorry you must leave. Do you know that I went to Paris? I have abilities for study. Yes? Like me. Come on, let's have a baby! I will do something useful too. Come on, let's do it! I raise him alone, I don't ask for any money. I swear to you! Enough, be good! And now I won't let you. I asked you before to stay and you didn't want to, now it's me who doesn't want to. Are you upset? - No... Enough, be good, little by little! See? I spoiled you. Dear general, he won't marry me anymore. I'll marry you. Good evening! Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you...! Mr. Weissman, this way! You won't stay long at Otilia's birthday, will you? After that, at my place... I'm waiting for you. I have prepared a special table for you. You know, I don't like her. She is not sincere. Please come! - You're late. Excuse me, Aurica retained me outside.. She keeps calling me in her room, I don't know what to do. My uncle and Mr. Weissman. I am pleased... A relative of ours. - Kiss your hands, ma'am! Make yourself at home! Eat and drink without any savings! The family is mixed. The friendly ones and the unfriendly ones. As you like to divide the people. Do you remember how well Eugenia played this piano? How gentle..She barely touched the keys and angelic sounds came out. You're mean, Lady Aglae. Miss Otilia plays wonderfully. Like a real artist. - Tell me, do you want anything else? - Why not? A little Roquefort. What do you have? What do you have? What do you have for sale? Milk, cheese, eggs, wait, I'll give it to you. Don't you know anything else? Leave us! The exit is this way! You don't even have to learn to play the piano with the technique of our century. Look at this! You put a needle and it's ready. Mozart... Tango, waltz... - You dance? - What else... I pray... - You confused my girl, sir. - Me? - She's a rich girl and she's not ugly at all. She's ugly, mother... She'll like you more than Felix. You're finer, more artistic. The girls nowadays are dying for artists. Come on, go! Go and tell her she has beautiful eyes! I don't know why you want to marry him. He still has time, he's young. - What are you saying? Others already have had children... - The children will finish him. For how long should we suport him yet? She's richer than Otilia. - She is bad! - How do you know she's bad? Aren't you ashamed? - You promised to come to us. - Don't be upset, I won't be able to come. I have a lot of exams. I want bread! Dad, let's go! It's no use to stay here anymore.. - Bread with cake? Are you starting again? Yes. Why do you think cake and bread are not good? Did you eat? Mr. Weissman! Mr. Weissman, you leave so early! But it's very late, miss. - Too bad. I thought you stay more. You could come to me. I would have served you some fresh cakes prepared by me. Maybe another time, with great pleasure. You're a little pale. It doesn't cost much to do some caodilate injections. I can make them for you. Good evening! - Mother? - Yes. What? Mother... What do you say? Weissman, isn't he a gentleman? Weissman? Your father's injections. We have thrown away the money. He is poor, but he has future. How come you talk about Weissman at 1 o'clock in the morning? Mother! Aurica... are you crazy ?! What are you thinking about? You're insane. First he doesn't even look at you, he's only a boy. But let's say he would look at you... You're crazy! Titi! I heard Felix is doing very well in college. He knows... German, French. Nerd. Yes. You are right. The book makes you stupid. Still, don't you want to ask him to tutor you? So you don't fail the exams again. Mother, but Titi is older than Felix. So what? Titi is weak, he learns hardly. Do you think he's coming to us? He's been watching Otilia all day. Ah, how unlucky I was. You are stupid. You weren't lucky... You were raised differently. I didn't teach you to cling to men's necks, the way Otilia does. Anyway, you could be more determined. I'm glad, glad I am that Pascalopol paid for the food. No, don't take it. Put it down, don't you see you don't have teeth? Then you eat it! You could have caught my fingers! Leave me alone! For God's sake, Otilia, you're driving me crazy! Leave and leave me alone! Go and marry Pascalopol! You all drove me crazy with Pascalopol. Who told you that I will marry Pascalopol? It's a nonsense. I can't renounce him the same I can't renounce you. - That's all! - Yes, but you weren't home last night. - And I haven't been at home in other nights, too. - Don't you think you're making fun of me? Haven't you been to Georgeta's? Am I scolding you for that? You realize that what Georgeta means to me is not what you mean. I want a clear word from you (I want you to speak clearly). And what word is that? A clear word. If you really love me, let's get married. - Suppose we'll get married. - Why suppose? Because what it does not exist is presumed. When do you think we could do that? - As soon as possible. What about your studies? You are not free to do what you want. - And then you have to know life, right? - The money... take them! Otherwise you'll be bored soon. - Why are you torturing me? Always excuses. You better tell me you don't love me. It would be easier. They aren't excuses. I think the wife has to be the last choice. I need a little playfulness too. Do you want me to try to marry like Aurica? And after all, we could stay engaged in Paris for a few years. You will do medicine, and I will do piano. and when our domestic instinct is born... Ah, how horrible... to be called "madam"! "Dear Madam!" Why should everyone know we got married? It would be a secret bond, just between the two of us. That would give us confidence, it would encourage us. The true trust, if lacks, cannot be given by marriage. But we can't stay together without getting married. Do you think there is no other way? Why? Because I love you, as a normal person should love. and I can only be loyal to my future wife. You're not Georgeta. I really am not. But if I wanted to travel, to... to do the most fantastic trades, to become dancers in Mexico.. would you give up your career? To your studies? Are you asking me that? I'm not asking you, Felix. I asked you a crazy question. I leave it to you to decide. Now it's all up to you. If I really love you, you will make the right decision. You're right, I love you! Don't doubt it! I'll decide what to do. But now I'm sleepy. I'm off to bed. Let's not forget: on vacation we go to the estate. You promised Pascalopol. - Yes, I promised him... Felix, I asked you to turn off the lamp. There is enough light coming from the streetlights.. Here, girl, do you remember how this place used to be? There was a great sun... on the stairs. Very large, where the light was... the light was luminous...very luminous.. and young ladies dressed in white and... boys in white dancing with young ladies. All of them, all of them, wonderful ladies... Don't you remember how it was? Marina! I can't eat anymore, Marina. Now come with me to show you something! I locked it, I have put it in the attic. But don't tell anyone. What do you want to show me? I drank a lot today, I'm dizzy, but I'll still drink. We're going to have a drink together now and I'll tell you a secret. If you can keep it in you, keep it in you, keep your mouth shut! Otilia! What do you want? I'm undressed. I want to talk to you. You're not good at all. You'll talk to me tomorrow. - No, now. - Tomorrow. Felix! Behave, Felix! What's wrong with you? What's wrong with you? Kissing should not be brutal, it should be light. Like this, sir! Let's get married! Let's run away! Do you want it? - How crazy you are, Felix, and how romantic! If anyone hears us? Where do you want to run? Anywhere. I want to get you out of here. How can you live among these people? You are always at Pascalopol's discretion. He takes you as much as he wants, he keeps you as much as he wants. After all, where did this man come from? Who is? What he wants? It's night and you're exalted. You'll get over it tomorrow. You know, Felix, I think you should know another girl, you know? I don't care. But you're really crazy! You are not yet an adult and you have a difficult career to make. I'll be a hindrance to you. - You won't be. It is not good for the wife to be older. Men get bored quickly. You do not love me. You love Pascalopol. He has money, of course. He gets what he wants, he can do anything with the money. Pascalopol is a kind of victim of mine, too. Forgive me! You are so warm! If you love me go to your place now. What if daddy or Marina hears us? You're like a suction cup. -Go, run! No... I'll come tomorrow night too. You're crazy. I won't let you, I'll lock the door. I'll break it! The legs... What's up, beautiful? Kiss your hand, Father! This rainy weather killed me. All the devils stab my bones. Maybe only boiled "tzuica" would scare the devils. Maybe you want to confess. You have some sins on your soul. - Every man has sins, Father. They stab all my bones. What's your name? I forgot. - Aurelia, father. Oh bless thee, God, your faithful subject Aurelia who repents for all her sins. Oh, my God, Oh, this bad weather is killing me. All I have to do is anoint myself with petroleum in the middle of summer. Tell me, did you lie during your confession? Did you mess around with women? This is for men. Tell me why you're here. I'm in love, Father! Have you been fooling around? - I'm not married, Father! You don't say? So you're a virgin, aren't you? Love, little dove, love! Come here to get married. I'm in love father, I'm in love with a man I shouldn't be with. Is he married? He's not of the same faith. Ah, catholic or protestant? It's allowed, it's allowed. He's not a Christian, Father. Then what the devil; God forgive me! He's not a Turk, is he? He's Jewish. - An Israelite? - Did you sin with him? - No, not yet. Deh little dove,what should I say? The unclean one is testing you hard. I'd say that if you bring a pagan to the Christian flock it means that you won a soul for Heaven, isn't it? What advice should I give you? But what does your mother, Coana Aglae, say to you? Yes, but she made love. She made love, of course she did, God... But if you say you are a virgin... Poor thing, how much you must have suffered because... you're not so young anymore.. - That's it... - I'm not anymore and I'm ugly! Never mind, you're not ugly. The Devil is ugly! He's black! Nevermind, the world is full of sin. But will he marry you? What do I know father? You're not among the worst in the world. Kiss your hands, miss! How do you do? Mr. Weissman, I've been waiting for you. You promised you'd come upstairs for an ?clair. - They are very good. - Maybe you can serve me downstairs in the living room. Anyway, I'll come. I have to give your father an injection first. You know, you don't stay here for long and then you leave. Really? How are you, young man? Sculpting, sculpting!? Are you ready, Mr. Tulea? Mr. Weissman, I feel very well, rejuvenated. Easy, easy... Are you crazy? Do you think he can give you a shot in the garden? Mom, Dad has become a saint. Don't prick him anymore. He's weak and out of blood. Yesterday a needle went into his finger and no blood came out. Our family has no blood... Don't sting him, he's sick... The family is sick... You have cakes. Bravo! Who did all this, miss? Your father? Yes... Please have some more. Do you like them? Thanks, I still have. All right, I'll take it. - Aren't you used to open the blinds? - It's nicer, it's cooler. Yes. Do you have something to tell me? You know, Mr. Weissman, I have no prejudices. If I loved an Israelite, I would take him regardless of what people had to say. Miss, but what do you mean? I don't know if you know, but I only partake in free love. Free love, yes? Don't be upset, but you are now going through an erotic crisis. You're a doctor, I've been in this condition for a long time. But I'm disarmed in this situation, miss. What can I do? You need an energetic man and forget about marriage. It won't be long until this odious, bourgeois institution will be repealed. Do you think I'm that ugly? Don't leave! Am I really that ugly? Who told you that? You're no more ugly or beautiful than other women. That's that. I'm ugly, I'm ugly. Go! I've bored you, forgive me. But how could the world bring you to this state? Look, I'll stay some more. If you think it will make you happy. I think so. But quickly, I have classes at four o'clock. Mr. Felix and Miss Otilia, here is a less picturesque place. Please forgive me! The road was wonderful. And I really like this old castle. Can I go up? You know you're my mistress. Everything you see belongs to you. Why don't you fix it? I was just thinking if it's worth spending the money. You see, Mr. Felix, the mansion belonged to my father. It was destroyed by the peasants. They cut the administrator into pieces with axes. - He was a very good and devoted man. Devoted to you. Can a young man as fine as you think that brutality is a solution? I don't know the peasants very well but, judging by what I see I don't think they are too happy. Pascalopol, who are they? These are the peasants I use to pick fruit. Hey! Hey you! Can't you hear? Come here! Here! What's your name? You know me! You know me, boyar! Pandele, come here! Kiss your hand, boyar! Increase the apple ration, make them happy. - Thanks! - Health! How strange this peasant! I've seen him somewhere before, but I don't remember where. This was a very unpleasant incident. Sorry! In general, I will try to liquidate anything that binds me to this primitive agriculture. My father, although a landowner, had very sporadic connections with this estate. Most of the time he lived in Athens, and when he came to the country he did not leave Bucharest. I rely mostly on gardening, raising cattle... and horse breeding. If I were to leave the country for good, I would sell everything without any regrets. I would only take horses with me. I love them very much. But your peasants must be very poor. They are not as poor as they seem. When I hired them, I didn't make a good deal. I should have sold the estate earlier. In fact, I tried. But I didn't get a good price. These peasant uprisings frightened the buyers. The peasants are uncivilised here. They don't have schools, they don't have... And here, Mr. Felix, it's about your future profession. Doctors aren't exactly crowding to come to these places. That's it, the situation of the peasants should be improved first. Usually the doctor is called too late, when there's nothing left to do. I hold your profession in great regard. Our faith today pails in front of science. I think we ought to step down. We arrived? I hope it will be easy to fix. You take the dog, Felix! Thanks! Oh, how soon autumn comes! I'll go look for a flower. Do you see any flowers in the field? - Come on, Felix, let's look, are you coming? I'm coming, I'm coming!! Come quickly! Who's there? It's us, boyar. - Are you, Lepadat? - Yes! - And where are you taking them? Up to the gutters, boyar. Didn't you lose any? - No, but I only let two of them in the stable They're not pulling well on the yoke. Go with them to the fair! You can sell them today. Good day, sir! Felix, I'm scared! They are terrible. Why aren't you paying attention, my dears? Lean on me! Mr. Felix, don't joke! Leave them! Let's go! Lucky nothing happened. This is Cristina, my mother's grandmother. And he's a relative of mine, an Italian. He lived around 1800. I forgot his name. I met Dr. Sima in Iasi. Your father. You look like him, don't you, miss Otilia? - Yes, yes. He would have become famous. You see, Mr. Felix, we come into the world with great thoughts. We make plans and when we go about fulfilling them something comes in the way. Maybe I'm such a loser. Maybe I am that kind of a loser myself. You see, my aspirations are of an artistic nature. And will be realized in miss Otilia. - How do I look? - Admirable. May I offer it to you? Pascalopol is a chic man and how lonely he is, poor thing! Are we going to take a bath? Come on! What is this world? Otilia, tell me! Nothingness makes jokes like a loitering demon. What is this world? What is it, what is it... What is it? I consult all philosophers, Plato and Socrates, To know if the shoes, are a sign that you existed.. Consult all philosophies, Consult, consult... consult. When everything withers and the eyes are deceived, I can't prove that you weren't a ghost. When everything withers, I can't, I can't... I can't. - Good evening! - Good evening! I've been expecting you for dinner. When I'm at the estate I'm not a agreeable companion to young people such as you. How can you say such things? You're upsetting me. I haven't done anything wrong. You know I love you. Forgive me if I was rude! Let's have a seat! Do you want to be the host? Be my guest! Pascalopol, did I tell you? We have been engaged by our parents since we were children. Like Eskimos. Let me show you the rooms. You barely eat. Sorry! You did not like it? Please forgive me, but I was not hungry. - I ate a lot. - Like a birdy... not there. To the right! - I would like to sleep in the barn, in hey. - Don't worry about this. We have enough hay. I hope you don't despise the room I prepared for you. You have everything you want there. I don't know if you've heard , Mr. Felix. but I've prepared a little country party. - I hope you won't turn me down. - Please forgive me, but I'm very tired. Your room... you know it. It also has a piano, something you won't find in the barn. You've always been "chic". I'll meet you outside. You look sad. I'm sorry. This is your room. You will find a lot of poetry in this apparent solitude. I will leave tomorrow. Okay, but you promised to spend much of your vacation here. - I have to break my promise. But what will Miss Otilia say? Otilia... Miss Otilia, Miss Otilia... I'm desolate, you're very... You are extremely polite with her. You're always with her. You were alone together here at the estate. "Look, do you see? This is your room, do you recognise it?" Isn't that what you told her? Yes, that's it. Mr. Felix, Otilia hasn't authorize me to tell you anything. However, some of these things, I imagine you know them as well. - I'm a very lonely man. - Why aren't you married? As far as I can tell you have an affectionate heart, you love children. A man like you, elegant, rich, intelligent. I am a very unsociable man, contrary to appearances. The rest of the truth doesn't matter. I don't think it matters anymore. Like any sensible man, I wouldn't want to have children except with a certain woman. I would have liked to have a daughter like Miss Otilia. And since this was not meant to be, I'm taking advantage of any opportunity to show her my little paternalistic affection as a man who failed onto family life. Miss Otilia has great sympathy for you. My discretion prevents me from speculating on the nature of her sympathy. Miss Otilia is like a daughter to me. Yes, please forgive me! You have treated me with great delicacy. Everything you say can be very interesting, but... in the special case of paternal love, I have some doubts. The love between parent and child is based first on instinct, isn't it? We are all nothing more than poor humans, Mr. Felix. I don't believe anything! You have a lot of money. A brilliant situation, that's it. That's it, do you understand me? I've spoken some words which I believe have offended you. Haven't I? - Please accept my apologies. - There's no need for that, young man. It's late and I wanted to let you sleep, unless you want to come to the feast. Everything you said was perfectly fair in the discussion. Don't look at me, I'm sometimes thoughtful and it makes me look upset. I love Otilia very much. Perhaps I won't back off from the mistake of marrying her. I've already told you, I'll do anything to deserve to have her. I fight with my means, you fight using your youth. And I admit: your weapon is more certain. But I'm a loyal enemy. Still, I'll let Miss Otilia make up her own mind. If poor Uncle Costache will pass away, you yourself will require assistance. - Would you like to study in Paris? - On whose expense? That can be arranged. It would only be a loan, of course until you are in the position to pay. Miss Otilia has great confidence and says that you will have a brilliant career. I'd be happy if I could help you. Why didn't you propose this to lawyer Ratiu? You are malicious, my lord. As far as I can tell, given his low-life qualities, Mister Stanica doesn't need my help to get ahead. He will either go into politics or start some gambling houses. I suspect that you would be investing in me for other reasons. Not the reasons you are thinking of. Trust me, Mr. Felix! I would be very pleased if you would accept my proposal. - Good night! - Yes... Mr. Pascalopol! I'm still going to marry Otilia. Good night! - One, two, three, four... - Like in London, like in Paris... - Please tell me, when the train leaves?? - In half an hour. Can you take me there? - Of course, sir! But you need to hurry or you'll miss the train. - Felix! Prepare the carriage. I heard you've met Miss Lili. You like it a lot? You love her? She's cute, but do you want me to marry Lili? I'm indifferent towards her. Tell me, what do you care the most about, besides love? Yes... Love is an important thing. But I don't think I could stand to be second among men. I need to be something in life. To do something, to have a connection to it. If I wanted to be a poet, I might not succeed. But I think I could become a good doctor. and I really want to be one. Felix, you want to be a great doctor, don't you? Sure. Then is your career more important than love? What role would I play in your life, Felix? I would dedicate everything to you. You would be the companion of my aspirations. and at the same time a goal of all my struggles. Would you like that? That's quite an ideal. Will you manage? Otilia, we have to be together all our lives. - What if I wasn't worthy of you? - But I'm not demanding anything of you. Felix, but you don't know me. A girl like me admires you, but she gets tired and prefers mediocre people. My ideal is to be admired as long as I am young. Do you know what could happen tomorrow? By the time I'm thirty I'll be old and when I see wrinkles in the mirror I will kill myself. My life won't matter after that. Felix, you are an ambitious young man and therefore a little selfish. A young man like you would like to change a woman into an icon. For his own use. - And you think I would make you unhappy! - Not Felix, but I'm mediocre. Insignificant to you. My only merit is that I realize it. Okay, then I'll be a "chic"man like Pascalopol. Would you like it that way? - Please don't try, it won't fit you. I love you the way you are, but I don't deserve you, that's the truth. - That's not true, you deserve everything. - Felix, but it's true. When you talked about the ideal, I was thomking that I forgot to dust the piano. Otilia, listen to me! It's time to leave Pascalopol. - But what do you have with him? I don't get it.. Leave him. Everybody is gossiping. - Why do you care about that? - I care. - Felix, don't upset me! I was in his room? Tell me, I was? You can go now. Goodbye! Adieu! Ladies and gentlemen, the miracle of the century penetrates there where nobody has ever been. This is a forgotten tribe somewhere in Africa. It doesn't even have a name. No one can talk with them. A corner of paradise, still untouched by our civilization. Who knows? Maybe they are happier... Don't you have something more joyful? Yes, Mr. Pascalopol, immediately. You stay here. What do you care? You scared my chickens... While you are eating, disasters are happening in the world.Good evening, mother-in-law! Good evening! Uncle Costache sells everything. - Who cares? Let it be. Well, he has already sold it! I'm coming from lorgu. He sold him the restaurant and the house. That knave, Felix, told him that Iorgu wanted to buy and the old man hurried to give that capitalist the house. How do you do, dear? No one knows, how much he got for it. One hundred, two hundred thousand.. His briefcase was full of money. What is he doing with them? Where does he put them? Where is he taking them? How about a folded sheet in which he leaves everything to Otilia? It's his business, I don't care. Leave me alone! Damn everything! I don't have anyone to defend my family's interests. Come on, eat! Simion, she is a shadow, as you can see. Mom, in the last time there's been something going on with Dad. Youth's sins. He's always been a little crazy. He's been eating bread for a few days now, which has driven me crazy. I don't know what's wrong with him. When I do, do you understand? I feel like a kind of flame... piercing the earth. Mom, he's crazy. Do you eat well? You are thirsty? I eat only a little, as needed for keeping the spirit's warmth... Sure. Why are you listening to him? He eats a lot and is getting thinner. I have a remarkable muscular strength. I'm a new born man. - Yes! Don't strain yourself, Simion! Be serious! Titi, don't you eat? I'm not hungry, I'm going to paint. Eat! Food is the elixir of life. There is no more bread! Oh my Goodness! There was a whole pile of bread loaves on the table. - Bring me more! - But we haven't eaten anything. Bring me some more! - Let's open a bakery, to satiate him! I'm coming back. Your father is really crazy. These days are his last ones. Let's take care he doesn't give everything to Aurica and Titi. He always was a little bit potty, poor thing.Do you think so? Eat father-in-law, eat if you are hungry! - You need to get stronger. -Don't I? Bring more bread! Bring bread! Stanica, Stanica, are you messing with the fool? Don't you see how much he eats? Let him eat, mother-in-law! Mens sana in corpore sano! Wait for me! I have a paper in my briefcase. Bring it to me! If he's hungry, he has to eat, right? His body asks for it... Dear father-in-law, now is the time. You are very healthy. You will live longer than all of us... How many years? What do you think, how old am I? How old are you? Well, how could I know? - One hundred and five. - 105? -You eat too! - I eat, I eat... How does it come that you are 105 years old? - Stanica, you are not better than him. Do you believe him? Titi, come and eat! I won't wait all the day long just because of you. Where is that boy? - He is painting naked women in the basement. Where should we hang those ones, too? He is obsessed. - Bread... - Give him bread! Bread again? Are you crazy? Give him bread! Give him bread, don't nag him anymore! Dear wife, your father... Give me the paper! Father-in-law... Sign this, I have to go! I'm not signing it, she is not my daughter. How did he know it was about the house? I'm not your daughter, I'm not your daughter! But whose daughter am I? You've promised me a house as dowry and let me instead live in an infect rented place, and Otilia lives here in our family like a... like a princess. Bread! She is not my daughter. Did you start again? Of course I understand your feelings. As a lawyer and a man I have seen many similar cases. - Sure, she may not be your girl. - That's right, she's not my daughter. - My daughter is Mary Magdalene. - Mary Magdalene of course, but she's my wife. And you, as a father-in-law, as an artist, should give her a home to live.. She should live 90 days in the desert. - Mother...- Mother... - Mom, we need to call a doctor. Nonsense! I won't spend the money now. That's the way he is, don't you know?- Bread! Trust me, it's an unimportant paper, but if you sign it, we will let to posterity a very important document. -She is not mine, I don't give anything. Well, damn it! Mother-in-law, I am a honest man, I love Olimpia. - I married her like that, "naked", out of love. - But we gave you money. The money had gone. Besides the amount was..... They were merely enough not to starve for only one year. You promised us a house. We are not asking for this, even if Olimpia has her rights as oldest daughter. But not even the house on Stirbei Voda street?! Damn it! Bread! -If the fool doesn't agree... - He doesn't, he doesn't. Of course, I'm not his daughter, but whose daughter am I, then? He keeps telling this. He doesn't give me the house on Stirbei Voda because he has rented it, I know it. It brings you income, that's why you don't give us the house on Stirbei Voda. Look, he is signing! - He has turned back to himself. I signed. Water, water! Stanica, quickly water! Of course, he ate a lot, four baskets of bread. I'll bring him to the hospital. - Mom, let's call a doctor! I'll look for Felix. Oh no, he hasn't returned yet. He is at Pascalopol estate. - You eat like an insane. - Bread, bandits! Mom, you shouldn't mess with him, really to allow him to eat so much bread. ( Signed:Jesus Christ) What should I do? He hides bread under the mattress. At night he goes and gives bread and coffee to the chickens. I've been born a poor man, that's it! I don't have any luck. Mother-in-law, we have to hospitalize him. Your man is really crazy. Vasiliad, go! Wait for me in the garden! Go! Mr. Stanica, he is dying! You killed him, Mr. Stanica. Shut your mouth! Let's bring him in the bedroom! Grab his legs! Stop grabbing, die. Shut up! Grab his legs! Let's bring him in the parlour! Where did he put the money? There ! Not here! - Do you think he has the money with him? - I don't know, I didn't see it. Come on! My mother-in-law. Sit here near the couch... I saw two masked bandits on the roof... Costache! - Go away, go away! - It's me, your sister! Look at yourself. - Get out! Stay calm! We're going to call a doctor, you're not young anymore. I hear, I hear! He says he hears, Mom. I want to talk to you like a sister. I see you're not cautious. From now on we are old people, we have nothing to expect. - Leave me, leave me! - How could I leave you? If you die, nobody knows where to look for the money. Elderly people see a priest, confess, save money for the funeral, for clean clothes. - Do you have a will? - I don't have any, leave me alone! Let him alone! - He's gone... - Turn off the light, it costs money! I know, Marina told me. It was so unexpected! Where is he? There. He must have hidden the money somewhere. He doesn't keep them in bank. Has he said anything? What do you think? Have you found out something? Nothing. I want to know, if he has done a will or not. If he hasn't done any will, then you mother-in law, being his sister, you are the only heiress. You have to take everything, I mean everything you can see. Leave me alone! I will take the house. He won't be so brazen to leave it to some strangers. How about the money... the money he has got for the restaurant and all the rest? Listen... I would try to find someway. Find out, Stanica! Ok, mother-in-law, I'll do anything for you. I hope only he hasn't left everything to Otilia. Now go, go... we are disturbing him. No, no... you stay here. We will switch turns to guard him. I will stay here with Titi now. - Olimpia, you should go too! - Where should I go, dear? Go and see that they won't take anything out of the house, if there is something left! You will come back later in the evening. If he has done a will and he hasn't done it in our favour, I will sue him. Can you play something nice? A chansonette? I have nothing to give to Titi and Aurica, if she will marry. Old fool man. I've heard you were at the cinema. What can you see there? Well, they show a well with a wheal, then they show a girl coming with a big bucket and then an old man and an old woman speaking to each other. Then they show the girl taking water with the bucket out of the well, the old woman... the old man is hitting her with the whip, then they show the girl in an empty house, she is eating a bread loaf. Afterwards the night comes and the girl opens the window. - Then... - What is that? - Is that cinema? - Yes, it is. - Then it isn't nice. - Indeed. You said, you knew a chansonette. Let's hear it! What have you done, old man? You see, if you are nasty. I'll tell you something: Colonel Constantinescu, next to Arionoaia, the one you've asked the drill.. well... he died last night. He got palsy. 60 years old. Like a thunderstruck! He dined with some guests till 11 PM and in the morning... pac! Tomorrow they will bury him. Can't you talk? Can't you move? This year was a very bad one, only children and old people. The autumn is coming, this is bad for the lungs and head. Tell me... have you done a will? I'll look after your health, but why don't you rest in the bedroom? It is more comfortable there. Otilia's money... You thief! That's it, old man! It's over! Now is the time for the young generation. You made me happy, you save me from misery. Go to him, he wants you to play for him. - He doesn't like me to play. - Now he likes it. Go! Be more sentimental! He died.. I've told him not to carry bricks. He died? Where could the money be? Look, this thimble I've looked so much for! Take your hat off, aren't you ashamed? - Olimpia, give me the handkerchief! - You have it in your pocket. Uncle, whom let you us? What a great lose for our family! Don't let him! I'll sell this house and the other house too. We are moving into Stirbei Voda. I don't sell anything, Olimpia is not my daughter. What did you say? Felix, if Costache is dead you have your own income now. You'll administrate it how you like. Otilia, you have Pascalopol. The piano belong to your mother. You can take it if you want, dear Otilia. - Without piano, we will die, mom. - I leave it to you. She was always a good girl. I'll sell everything, I want to have fun, too. All my life I worked very hard for my children. Did you see? He kept all the bad sets and he sold the good ones. Yes, Simion! All my life I worked, and you had fun with all the whores. Don't speak, you scum, don't speak of me! You gave me only vinegar, you sold my clothes. Look at my bad state! Maria Magdalena is taking care of me, she is my daughter. We are staying here in the warm, an she is in the desert, poor one! Otilia, now you'll go with me, don't you? Dad has died... I have nothing to do here. I'll go with you, Felix. Don't be angry, but I want to be alone. Now. Nice funeral! Many carriages, nice weather! When they die, the rich people are lucky. Aglae, bad like a bitch, shed no tears. But that was it. The dead won't come back from the grave. Let's venerate them and look toward the new generation! - You too, dear, haven't cry much. - Like you? You cried like a country woman, what a disgrace! If I were dead, you wouldn't cry so much. What should I do, I'm a loving, sensible man. What do you have there? What has happened to you? - Where? I don't have anything. - Stanica, you are hiding something. What's there? - Olimpia my sweet, my dear... - You have something under your shirt. All I see convinces me that nothing is more profound than the mystery of marriage. The eternal love, for which you let everything behind. Look, Madame! Do not spy me, please! I'm lawyer, more than a priest. Maybe someone told me a secret. When someone tell me a secret, I burry it in myself. Do not search in my stuff! I forbid you. I receive papers, on which depends the honour and property of many people. If you search in my papers and by mistake you put one in fire, then you have destroyed a client and myself, too. That's it! Besides, I must find an office, to work in peace. What's that? Why you are bugging me in the middle of the night? - Let me sleep! - Sweet woman... Let me... Let me sleep! After all, you are my companion, you are my first love. What is the matter with you? Have you drunk too much at the funeral? - I'm a loving husband, sentimental... - Are you crazy? Don't you see I'm sleeping? Why do you bugging me? Look Madame, the goal of the marriage is the breeding. When a woman doesn't breed, she will have no rights. As long you don't give me a family with many children, you make me unworthy to the country. Without descendants to carry my name, you are actually not my wife. All right, all right, leave me alone... I'm sure you took drugs to opose my efforts. From this very moment, I see clearly. Being no more my wife "de facto", I'll take care that soon you'll be neither "de jure". Inside me is a great battle between the feelings and the duty. The feeling pushes me for the one who was my wife and the duty for the society make me look for the paternal happiness, which you refused me. Nonsense! It doesn't matter, do you understand? Everyone knows that the old man couldn't write. Only one document could be important: The will. Give me the most terrific will, and I'll opose it. Look, the limousine! It worth three times more than I've spent for it. Do you like it? We'll go to Venice and Sicily... if it wouldn't be too expensive. We'll go to Valenii de Munte, I have an uncle there, he is in debt to me, it'll cost us nothing. Oh, my God, how stupid I was! I married him without wedding. He was a ragged one. When he found money he left me for a... - I'll find you a better one! - Where can you find it, mom? - You will see! - Where? -How stupid... - Calm down, my child! - You'll have a child. - You are crazy. You'll have a child, you can see it. Who is the gentleman? - You hurt me. - I'll tell about you to mom. - I'll tell mom... - Are you crazy, you hurt me! Titi, leave her alone! Wait! Titi, let her go... I'll tell mom. I'll tell mom that you are pregnant. Ugly as you are! I thought a lot. It is in our interest. We cannot marry now. We cannot marry now, but surely later. I came to you to give you a proof that I love you. We can be husband and wife without the priest's blessing. I'm a fool. I have the proof. Forgive me that I didn't trust your love! Now I'm sure that you'll be my wife, and I'll wait for you, no mater how long. What you have done now, proves that you love me. I want, at least, if you are loyal, to sleep this night in your room. As you wish. Let me see how it feels in a man's bed! - You'll sleep on the couch. All right. Otilia, I have a strange feeling. Of course I love you more then anything on this world. And I desire you. I'll not be able to love someone else. Yes, I want you passionately. Maybe just because of it...I'll wait, until you will realise this. Yes, Felix, we will do so. Nobody will think that we are ridiculous. Good night! Otilia! There is a letter from her. Felix, you must forgive me.... She leaved with Pascalopol. For good. I left. If you were capable of such a self-control, it means that I was right. The most important think for you is your future. The most important think for you is your future. You must study. You wouldn't have time for me. I don't know if I'll be happy with him, but...I wanted to be free, to see the world. I miss you, right in this very moment. What will happen later, I don't know. Besides Pascalopol, everything will be strange to me. Maybe I'll return. You know well, I'm getting boring very easy. But don't wait for me! If you'll find a girl to love you, be happy! I wish you that, with all my heart. And you must forget me... I'm sure you can. We are done. I salute you! - Who is he? - A civilian. Emergency case. I brought him, because of Mr. General. He must go to the hospital, if you can do something... - Yes... - You'll see him. Mr. Pascalopol... Yes, Mr. Felix, what a weird situation! What an occurrence! You recognised me. In my pocket there is a photo right... downside. Otilia... don't recognise her? Otilia... It wasn't a fair play, I loved her very much. She could be very happy next to me. Mr. Felix, maybe, I was wrong, indeed. Please, stay! Stay calm, my God... Mr. Pascalopol, where is Otilia? - Doesn't this train leave anymore? - It's leaving, lieutenant. It's leaving right now. This one is the last one... morphine. What is this world, Otilia you tell me! Nothingness make jokes like a loitering demon. What is this world? What is it, what is it? I'm asking you where has gone the year, when you were playing in the parlour. Or you were agitating the piano like a horse herd. I'm asking you where is the year, I'm asking you... I'm asking you.
