Hello, can you hear me? He's coming tonight. Julija! Julija, the rope If he stays, we will see the terrain tomorrow. That's it. We need to take care of that. I'll call him. Okay, bye. Julija, the rope. This is a private pier! You can anchor your boat in my bag! Pavo. He's coming tonight. He knows where it is better for him. Do you have wine? Plavac. Plavac, but a good one. The one we drink at Easter. Delivered here until 14:00. Did they take anything? Murina. Thank God. Help me with this. I can't take any more orders today. I know. Please be patient. Tonight is important. What happened? Nothing. Look. I used to wear this before you were born. It's beautiful. - Nella! - Coming! - Come clean the fish! - Okay. And this one? You will wear what daddy tells you to Javier is coming. Your father will be in a good mood. What is this? Just some old things. I'm not allowed to wear anymore? - Let me go! - What's this? She bit her own flesh to free herself. She will buy an apartment in Zagreb for her children's college. This man who is coming to my house tonight is God on earth. I know. We just need to make him happy. Meet us tomorrow at 11am in Mana. - 11 o'clock. - Right. What's that? - Ivo let you take his boat. - Thank you. Julija, go wash the chairs. Stop playing with water. Here. - How much is it? - $350. Your daughter walks naked to provoke. - She is covered. - Right. Nella, what wine is that? - Plavac. - Plavac? What wine does Javier drink? - Plavac. - Which one? - Tell me, which one? - I don't know which one. Tell me which Plavac does Javier like? Julija! Ante! Longing. What are you doing naked? Go get dressed. Hurry up! Smile, you beast, what does it cost you? Wow, it's beautiful! How am I? Does it look good? Put this on - I don't want it, it's yours. - It's elegant. - It doesn't matter. - Just today. Trust me. If your father sells the land, we can move to Zagreb. Let's go. - How is he? How is he? - He's fine. Drambuie. Where is Drambuie? Where the fuck is it? It's here. Glasses. I am going home. Javi... They don't want to hear it now. - Ante, not now. - Why not? Let's go. I sit on the shore looking at you Looking from afar where you become the sky How can I count all the paths and waves you create with the wind? I look into your blue depths What secrets do you hide? These are the colours that seduce sailors when someone stays in their stillness? See you in your bad temper And I don't trust you Sea, I don't know how to understand you In front of you, the sea, I am speechless - Say goodnight. He is here on business, not to see you if you misbehave. What if Pavo doesn't sell the land? Julia, you left the rope in the water. - The tide is low. - I told you to take the rocks. Sit down with me. It has less of a meter to the left. There's a big rock on the left! You're going to hit it! - There's a big rock on the left! - I don't need your help! - I asked you something. - Let her go. - Ante. - Leave her. Next time, think twice before twice before you say something. He needs this. If he gets it, he will be calmer. If he wins money, he will be worse. How are they friends? They met each other when they were young. People like Javi do not have many friends like that. Hello? Where is he? No, it is today. I told you five times! What an idiot! Fuck! I bring money to his door and he's late. The bones turned to ashes in seconds. They were only a couple of years older than me. Mom, wait! I'll go. He likes you. Come on, mother. Come, mother. Dad's back. Stop looking at him like that. It looks like you're in love. Fuck, Julija! Let's go! That hurts! Let me go! You're going to break my leg. Leave it. You went too far, as always. Say good night and go to bed. What are you doing? Nothing. Is that your Mums dress? You have a man's shoulders. Where the fuck is she? Try deeper. I can be like him. I can send you to some boarding school in the mountains. Julija, stop! I'm serious. I forbid you to talk to him. Pavo and the mayor are coming. I don't want to see your face! - They are coming. - Still sleeping. It's already 10 o'clock! Lower! What happened last night? What do you mean? Nothing happened. Damn it! I will take care of it. Did you tell him that my wife doesn't want to sell? - Hi, girl. - Julija, we are working. Julija, come here. People burned to death. You can't build hotels there. - We will build a memorial. - Just one second. You forget quickly. I destroyed his boat to save his family. I lost everything. Why don't you remind Mare of this? Seven boys went to fight the fire on that useless piece of rock and never came back. So, why should they have died for nothing? - We will make a monument for them! - The dead are dead. It would be better if he had burned to death as well. We need to go with Javier. He will forget about us as soon as he boards the plane. - Come, help me. - This time will be different. Javier will leave tomorrow. He is in love with you. - See how he looks at you? - He is playing. - He has been doing that for years. - That's not true. - He needs you. Let's go with him. - And then what? Do you think we will go around the world with him? He has his own family. You know that, right? If I had your strength, I would use it. Then, it is good that you don't. I know you want it. I saw you with him. It's obvious. You deserve better. - What did you tell him? - That I'm taking him tonight. What did I say about leaving your room? Why did you let her out? I let her out? What do you want? To lock us all in the house? Maybe you won't respect me, but she will! Are you angry with me? So I can't dive Just because you can't? Leave me alone, Julija What did you want me to do? - It has nothing to do with you. - What does it have to do with? What does it have to do with? I got scared. - You are lying. - Didn't I ask you to leave me alone? Leave me alone! You're jealous. - What is wrong with you, Julija? - Nothing is wrong with me. You ruined your life and now you want to ruin mine. You play lovers behind daddy's back, but you're a coward and can't have what you really want. I'm leaving with him. I don't care if you come with me! Don't talk to your mother like that. When he leaves, you will be grounded. You won't go anywhere. Do you understand? Stop, Julija! Turn off the engine! You became important overnight, didn't you? Where are you going? - Do you think you're smart? - Let me go. Do you think you're smart? - What did you talk about? - Nothing. What? For thirteen years, I worked for this man. Then, one wrong act and he threw us out. Me, you and your mother! He didn't give a shit! Who do you think he is? Do you think he's your friend? He is not here to buy your land. You will never go to Harvard! You'll never go anywhere! You want to behave like an animal? You'll be caged like one! Let me go! You will be alone in this house Like a dog! You will spend ten years in this hole. - Get in! - You'll be alone here! Open the door! Open up! Here, eat something. You can take this with you. You provoked him. - Do you know what will happen? - You did this to us. Nella! Let's go. We could have had a normal life, but you chose this. Is it my fault? One day, you will realize what I do for you. What have you done? To be the beauty queen of the island? Nella, what did I say? Mother! Mother! Father! I hate you! Go! beat me in front of everybody. Beat me in front of everybody. Mom hates you! Everybody hates you! You coward! Coward! You are no longer my daughter. I disown you! Don't touch me! Nella, come here! - Julija, let's go home. - Don't touch me. Nobody loves me? And who loves you? Remember this
