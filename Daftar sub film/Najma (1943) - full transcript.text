Oh beautiful Almighty! Oh beautiful Almighty! Oh beautiful Almighty! Oh beautiful Almighty! 'Lord and Slave both stand here in the same row.' 'None is the Master, none the Servant.' Oh Lord, you are the highest authority You solve the problems of one and all You are the protector of those that have gone astray You are the hope of the helpless Oh Lord, please listen to our prayer Please heed the pleas of us orphans We are without resources, we are destitute The fact is we are in despair Rescue us from the atrocities of the wealthy Please preserve the honor of us orphans May our garden remain ever green May our country remain ever green Doctor, tomorrow is Eid (festival). Has the tailor delivered the clothes for the kids? Yes sir, the clothes have come. Sir, you are so concerned for the orphans. If only every person had the same sentiments in his heart... our orphans would have no woes left. That's right, kids are all equal... be they rich or poor. Besides, these are kids... whom we are duty bound to look after on behalf of God! May god bless you! Thank God for your presence. Else we all of us have forgotten our duties! But Doctor, I notice even you tend to their health all day. This is commendable too! You are being very charitable. God knows I love all the kids as much as my son Yusuf! Where were you, Bedil? Sir, I was in the operating room. Just for once speak the truth. Yusuf? - Yes? - Was he there? Actually, Doctor... I left the operating room a little early. Because my heart is very weak, I can't watch the operation. Idiot. Bedil, you have no heart. How can your heart be weak when you don't have a heart? Oh yeah. Didn't you notice the three eye candies surrounding me? You see, my boy? A heart operation is so risky. But Mr. Bedil, do you even know... how that man's frail heart withstood such major surgery! How? Actually his heart was strong thanks to lots of heartbreak! Be that as it may, I consider the world of love an asylum... and every lover a lunatic! - Well, to each his own... - Hello, Bedil. - Hello! Oh, hello. - Hey! Wow. It seems like candies have been frozen... and floated into the hospital. Oh! So you are a follower of this love! My dear boy, you don't need for them. They would lay their lives for you. All you need is a box of chocolates for them. Anyway, that is my world. Tell me. How is your love story progressing these days? It's okay. I see her once or twice a year. These days... Oh yes, you see her during one crescent moon. And then at the next crescent moon. Have you ever dated her? We haven't dated. I've been flirting with her for years now. Tell me. Does the man only have a daughter? No sons? No, only one daughter. And how is Mukarram related to the Nawab? He isn't kin. He is his wife's oldest nephew. Has he given up studies completely? He isn't interested in studies. Day and night he gambles, hunts, plays chess, and flies kites. He only wakes up at 10:00 in the morning. - Ten o'clock? - Exactly. And only when a pretty maid plays sweet notes on the harp. Oh, wow! That is the joy of life, my boy. Bless me for I have turned you into a killer. - Shut up! - Shut Up? Water. Soap. The Nawab Sahib hasn't arrived yet? My quail is itching for a fight. Yes. He'll arrive shortly. Even my quail is in the same condition. Take a look. He is getting as wild as a lion! We'll know soon. Sure. Greetings. Greetings! So you made it? - That's right. - Have a seat. Please begin. Mir Banne, how is the quail doing? Take a look, sir! Great. He is quite tall. He really appears to be fierce. Sir, he is as sharp as a sword. Never mind a sword, he's more like a cannon. No doubt at all, sir! He won't be defeated easily. He's as strong as steel, sir. Mir Banne? Yes sir. Get ready for the battle. Wow! Buck up! Come on! Great! Wow! There goes! Well done my lion! You have proved your loyalty today. I have never enjoyed a lion-fight as much as this. I swear I have no regrets about his running away. He made Nawab Nabban's quail bite the dust. Nawab Nabban was training his quail for the last seven years. But he fought with so much gusto. Looking at his last move... I thought it chased Nawab Nabban's bird. The kick wasn't strong enough... or it would have worked. Defeat or victory depends on luck. But the real challenge is the spirit of the heart! I told you earlier this quail had gone old. Train another bird. Did you see that? Yes Sir. He ran away because he was old. Now you say it is old. You were all praise for it earlier. When I praise, you praise. When I criticize, you criticize. Yes Sir, I am not the quail's slave. I do your bidding, sir. I know you only too well. Yet I am prepared to sustain you. These dark clouds won't stop chasing us. One keeps rolling in after another. But how will the moon be visible? - Why? - When the full moon is visible on earth... how will the crescent moon show up? Stop it. I don't like such talk. Felicitations, ma'am. There's the moon. - Where? - Out there, ma'am! Felicitations! Felicitations! Hey, where is it? Sorry ma'am, I was praying. My eyes have been yearning for a very long time Please inhabit the world of my vision Having made you the possessor of such beauty... who told God to make you so cruel? Please inhabit the world of my vision I would sacrifice myself on this bashfulness Come forward and please my heart Please inhabit the world of my vision My heart is in your custody It is up to you. Inhabit it or destroy it Please inhabit the world of my vision When he comes to our house tomorrow for sweets... I will surely complain to father. - Oh, please don't tell the Master, ma'am. - Why not? It would mean we are weak. We cannot wreak vengeance. So what should we do? Listen. Eid. Let's hug and celebrate Eid Eid. Come let's celebrate Eid, friends Daily it is milk and other sweets Today it is only sweet vermicelli, friends Eid. Let's celebrate Eid Eid. Come let's celebrate Eid, friends Big or small, everybody celebrates Eid Everybody sings songs of joy Sweethearts celebrate at Eid, friends Eid. Let's celebrate Eid Eid. Come let's celebrate Eid, friends The old and the young wish each other happily Friends wish their bosom friends! Eid. Come let's celebrate Eid, friends Eid. Let's celebrate Eid Superb! The sweets were so delicious. Everyone was licking their lips in glee. Here's your gift, Tilak. Shabnam, here's your gift! And this is Nawab Najma's gift! Thank you, father! The doctor and his son Yusuf have arrived. Please ask them to sit. I'm coming! Is this the time to visit? It's been twenty years since he's settled in Lucknow. Still, he knows nothing of Lucknow's etiquette. That's right. But why should I forget my manners? Father, I was unable to tend to the guests. If you permit me, may I serve sweets for these two? Sure, my child! Did you see that, sweetheart? Even the children of sociable families become sociable. - Greetings! - Greetings! - Greetings! - God Bless you! - Happy Eid! - Happy Eid! - Happy Eid! - Happy Eid! Please take a seat! Have you put the chilies in his water? - Yes. - I hope you didn't put chilies in the Doctor's water. - No. - Get the salt. Here. Add lots of salt. That will teach him a lesson for flying kites. Taste that. Should I add some more? It's like poison, ma'am. Poison! Be careful not to put salt in the Doctor's bowl. No, I'm adding sugar to his bowl. He's not to blame. Go bring Gulabo. Look, this bowl is for the Doctor. And this one is for his son Yusuf. - But why so, Ma'am? - You don't know? The Doctor consumes more sugar... while his son consumes less. - Don't forget. - No Madam, I get it. This bowl is for the Doctor and this one is for his son. Correct. Go. Nawazish Ali! Nawazish Ali! What? Look Nawazish Ali, this bowl is for the Doctor... and this one is for his son. But why two different types of bowls? I'm fed up with your whims. Mind your own business. Shut your mouth or you'll regret it. Look here, you always try to lord over me. I've been here for last 17 years. Hundreds like you have come and gone. You are always jabbering. - Do you know who has sent these sweets? - Who? The young mistress has sent it over personally. And she specifically demanded what I conveyed to you. So why didn't you say anything all this time? You should have said so in the first place. You just got saved from being hanged, Nawazish Ali. And if she does not hang Me, you do it. Stop it, you villain! Take a good look at your face! I forgot. Which bowl is for whom? Got it! This is for the doctor. No, this is for the son. Forget it. Who cares? Whatever. Doctor, today's sweets have become famous... in almost all of Lucknow. Come, please have some! Thanks! - Please have some. - Thanks. Quite frankly, I haven't eaten better sweets than these. Wonderful! - Go ahead and have it! - Yes. There, he ate it! Oh, his expression didn't change? Look, the father is paying for the son's misdeeds. Poor Doctor. He must be thinking we add salt in our desserts. Perhaps we will get the son with the betel leaf. I hope the betel leaf gets caught in his throat. This is superb, sir. I have never eaten better vermicelli before. Have some more, son. Do not hesitate. Tell me, Doctor, what is your opinion of the vermicelli? It is very good. It seems as if I am sitting in heaven... eating a divine dish. Doctor, it seems you don't eat too much dessert. No, sir. When you were having the vermicelli... I could tell from your expressions. Yes sir. Thanks! Yusuf dear, which year of medicine are you doing? The fourth year, sir. What is the matter, Yusuf dear? Is everything okay? The fourth year. The one who offers me chilies in betel leaves... I am praying for her quietly At least my love has left this effect It has had a silent impact on her as well Oh, dear heart, lest my love be disgraced Please be discreet about love Some day she will surely be mine My heart says so. My heart says so quietly Give it to me. This is my Eid gift from aunt. You came to collect your Eid gift... but did you think of going to aunt's house to wish her? When she was alive you always went there. Nobody hides behind a veil in dad's presence... but everyone hides behind veils in my presence. Who other than Najma hides behind a veil in your presence? Sure. Till yesterday she used to play with me... but today she has to hide behind a veil? Why shouldn't she? After all, she is a growing girl. In fact, you should avoid going in front of her. That's why I don't go there. Don't go. You want me to scold you some more on Eid? Here. Take your gift. Greetings! God bless you! Why have you come now? Mom, may God grant you a long life! Please, may I have another five hundred rupees? What for? Just the day before yesterday you took five hundred. And now this? This is my Eid gift. And the other five hundred? A hundred went towards the kite fliers' wages... a hundred towards the quail trainers' wages... a one hundred-fifty towards the chess players' wages... and a hundred-fifty for other entertainers. Five hundred rupees are gone. And what is this money for? Look Mom, winter has set in. I need to buy new pigeons. I have to get their clothes sown. And above all, eight kite games remain to be played. Mukarram, when will you mend your ways? You gave up studying ages ago. If your marriage is proposed shortly... their first query will be, What does the boy do? Mom, what are you saying? I did O level in English. I know Arabic and Persian too. What more do you want, mom? But my boy, you must put this knowledge to good use. Oh! You mean to say I should take up a job. Has anyone in the family taken a job before now? Give me one example of anyone having taking up a job. Those were different times. Becoming a judge or barrister brings you renown these days. Mom, the fact is that if you have money... you can buy off ten judges and ten barristers. Look at how famous your son is. I am an excellent kite-flyer, excellent quail-fighter... nobody can beat me in the board games. And don't even mention chess. I receive hundreds of invitations from abroad. But what can I say? I cannot leave Lucknow. As for people like Sultan Khan... they are hopeless. - Really, my son? - Would I lie to you? These wrists are so strong, all of Lucknow swears by them. Is that so? Is that so? Recently your son broke an iron rod. Oh God! I hope you didn't hurt yourself, son. Not at all, mom. These wrists are made of lead. Tell me, is your son inferior to any judge or barrister? Not at all, Mukarram! You are right. Then let me have those five hundred rupees. Give it to me. Go on. Go on. - Go on. - Okay. The heart. It is the most vital organ of the body... and is related to all other parts of the body. The heartbeat gives life to the entire body... and if it stops life comes to an end. Bedil, matters of the heart are being discussed. Love, too. My dear friend, you discuss love daily. Has there been any mention of love as yet? Let us clarify this today. Watch out, my boy, lest you be embarrassed. Excuse me Doctor, I want to ask you... where in the heart does one find love? The world of the heart is so big. Love must be lying in some nook and cranny. That means you admit that love actually exists... and that it is found around there? It is perfectly clear now. Sit down. Shut up! So you admit love exists? But what is this about? Why the preoccupation with love? I'm not preoccupied with love, he is. And I am not an enthusiast of love. Not an enthusiast, or incapable? Excuse me. If you aren't an enthusiast of love, you aren't human. In fact it is for the sake of love... that this whole wide world of has been created. Why did you have to tease me? You are very mischievous. But I got back. You got stung by the chilies. What if had told my dad? But how could I have done that? Did I have the heart to do so? You could have borrowed it from me, my dear... and told the Nawab. Tilak, I was trying to compose a couplet. Sure. To get the correct emotions... you placed Mr. Yusuf's torn kite was in front of you. Nonsense! Where is the paper? Your wish is my command! Shall I tell you something? What? Love seeks a confidante. Tell him tomorrow if not today. What's the big deal? Shut up! It appears as if you are looking for trouble. Sure. A truthful person is always looking for trouble. Wait. Why? Why? Why? Why would you say such a thing? The secret in your heart will come out With that heartthrob thief Which thief? Why? Why would you say such a thing? This is no way to behave I don't understand you If you make the wrong move, you are sure to lose Why? Why would you say such a thing? Love is playing sun and shade at this time You will spend your nights counting stars in future Throughout the night. Throughout the night Why? Why would you say such a thing? My dear, I'm fed up with your love story! Ages have passed without any result. I did not fall in love for results. Why else? Stop talking nonsense! Either you take my advice... or stop telling me the story of your hopeless love. Buddy, tell me a simple way. Your suggestions are the kind that could get me bashed. Really? So you're afraid of being bashed up now? Then you should forget love. Go to Banaras. My dear man, I swear if I were in your place... by now I would have spoken to her many times... and met her thousands of times. Will you suggest something or go on lecturing me like this? My dear, take me for instance. Listen, when I fell in love with my wife... Listen... that is your sister-in-law, around six years back. Not so I could flirt with her while another married her. - Really? - But because I could take her as my wife. My dear I swear by you, I was bashed up hundreds of times. - I was laid up in bed. You know what I did then? - What? As soon as I got up from bed I was back to my old ways! You're really brave! So what was the outcome? You're asking about the outcome again? Don't you see... I have six kids like you playing in the house? Your kids! When did you get married? Take it for granted. Such things are taken for granted. Well, trainer Bedil, let me try my luck today. Sure. You must go! Take the plunge, my dear. Success is desperate to kiss your feet. But if something untoward does happen... Untoward? What do you mean? I mean even if you get bashed up. I shall keep a bed ready. Bless me for I turned you into a hearty romantic. Tilak is out! Tilak is out! Go stand facing the wall in front of you. Don't come till someone calls out to you. Go. - May I come? - Not yet. May I come? - Not yet. - Oh God! Who is this devil? Not the devil, it is I, Yusuf. - Oh, Mr. Yusuf. - Yes. What are you doing here at this hour? I have come for some very urgent help from you. - From me? - Yes. Only you can do it. Well, what work? Well, what work? Just let me have a glimpse of Najma. So the fire is raging equally on both the sides. Not today. Not today? Then when? Tomorrow. Oh no. I shall die. I'd be grateful if you tried today. Oh God! How do I manage it? Look, go notify Najma. After she's notified, ask her to hide over here. Did you hatch this plan when you left home? No. By your grace I only thought of it just now. Tilak, you may come now. Tilak, you may come now. Coming. I am waiting, ma'am. Please don't forget. You're under my oath. Ma'am is tagged! Ma'am is tagged! Ma'am is tagged! Okay, tell me, where shall I hide? Exactly the same place I hid. Ma'am, do not come out until I call you. May I come? Not yet. May I come? - Not yet. - My goodness! Who is this ill-mannered fellow? It is bad manners no doubt. But I'm afraid you didn't recognize me. How would I know? Great! Miss, I am the person who was robbed at your place. - Who robbed you? - You did, Miss. - Me? - Yes, miss! What did I rob? Well, you stole my kites... fed me chilies in the betel leaf, and stole my heart. Today it appears as if... the world seems to be changing Today it appears as if... the world is taking on a new zeal The color of happiness is spreading across the world The world is taking on a new zeal Whose voice did my ears hear? This heart is uncontrollable in the bosom The more she tries to hide from me... the more my eyes yearn for her The stars are twinkling Someone is smiling somewhere To whom is the moon so attracted? The moon is alighting on the Earth Even your voice is laced with pain now. What? Do you ever get any sleep? Go to bed. And are you resting too? I was about to sleep. But I was disturbed by your arrival. You think you will get sleep if I go away? Why? Because you will not sleep. You're being crazy again. No, not crazy. Listen, I nodded off for a little while... and dreamt of you standing near the wall like a thief. Suddenly I heard someone's voice from outside. Whose voice? Well, I forget. Actually I was sleepy... but it sure as hell sounded like Mr. Yusuf's voice. So both of you were in on the conspiracy? Listen. I don't want to hear it. Go away. It is to your advantage. Listen or you'll be sorry. Uh-huh. 'Uh-huh' means 'yes'. I didn't hear it. When you say 'hear it' after the 'not', it means you heard me. Continue speaking nonsense! Turning away means 'as you wish'. Okay. Good night! Please go to sleep soon. God damn, the love patient. Dad is around. I meant to say, God bless you. And it is time for your medicine. Tel me, what was the outcome? Did you meet? Spoke to her? No. Nothing much. You aren't opening up today. Something is fishy. Would I lie to you? I told you nothing much happened. You are hiding things from a person like me? Look at me. My boy, your eyes are dripping love. My foot, my tutor! That means my eyes didn't drip love before. It did, but it was awful. You have become stronger thanks to me, else... there is no control on love. This is a fire. Hey! My dad is unwell. So what? I am merely singing, not crying. And music is beneficial for all ailments. You want me to be beaten up? He is not well. Bless me for I have turned you into a hearty romantic. Hey! What are you doing? Stop it, will you? - Greetings! - Greetings! Yes, tell me. Who is this? He is the Nawab's employee. I see! So this is the Nawab's... What's the matter? The young mistress is unwell. The Nawab has sent for the Doctor. You go ahead. I shall send him right away. There you go, my dear. Just one meeting and she's got love fever. Quiet. Bless me for I have turned you into a hearty romantic. Yusuf! Your dad's here. Hey, what's all the noise about? Greetings, Doctor. Bedil is here. God bless you, son. Father, Nawazish from the Nawab's house was here. The young lady is unwell. They wish to see you. - Have they called me now? - Yes. Okay. Hush! Yusuf, please get my bag ready. I shall change and be back right away. Very well. Hey, let go. This is a good chance. Hide his bag somewhere. What good will it do? Tell your dad to proceed in a hurry... while you follow him with the bag. That's fantastic, my boy! You see? This is called expert advice. - Bless me for I have turned you into a hearty romantic. - Hush! - Yusuf! - Yes? Yusuf, my boy, bring me my bag. I am looking for it but I can't find it. What? Where has it gone? Well, it must be around. Father, you are in a hurry. You proceed and I will follow you with the bag. Okay. But please bring it quickly. Yes. Yes. I shall come right away. Mr. Yusuf has come. Escort him in. You shouldn't have taken the trouble since you are unwell. Not at all. I'm feeling better now. Even Yusuf can attend to such minor treatments. Yes. By the grace of God... Yusuf even attends to major ailments now. - Greeting, sir! - God bless you! Where was the bag? It was right there. But neither one of us saw it. I heard you tend to major ailments now by God's grace. Yes, sir! Something interesting happened yesterday at the Medical College. What happened, Yusuf? Well, a patient came in with fever. None of the doctors could diagnose his fever. And? I took his pulse and by your grace I told them... the cause of the fever was terror and fright! Great! That is really excellent! God bless you! Well, please take a look at my daughter. She might not be suffering with the same kind of fever. Yes, this fever is common these days. Dad? Sure, son. Please go ahead. I would like to take her pulse. Certainly. Come along! Yusuf wants to take her pulse! Very well. Come. Is everything alright, Yusuf? Well, I did mention to you earlier. It is the same. Terror-fever. You saw how it affected me? I immediately got a shock. Yusuf, is the pulse-rate very fast? Yes, father. But there's no reason to worry. This is symptomatic of this fever. I need to make some queries now, sir. Yes, of course. Tell me, ma'am, did you go near a shrub in the past few days? I mean in a garden? Yes! Now ask her if she saw a shadow near the wall. She says she thought that shadow was a human being. But it turned out to be a monkey. Oh, okay! What did you say? Monkey? How did those cheeky monkeys get into the garden? She says she's afraid. Don't worry, young lady. The monkey can't do you any harm. Monkeys are known for this. The rest is up to the monkey. No problem, ma'am. Please do not worry. I shall get my dad to write out a prescription. Well done, Yusuf. You seem to know a lot more than mere medicine. Yes. This is the marvel of science these days. Tell me Nawazish Ali, what news have you brought? Sir, the doctor is still unwell. Hasn't his pain subsided since last night? Yes sir. That's kidney pain. I shall accompany you to see the doctor right away. Why did you take the trouble? What are you saying? A neighbor's duty comes before a relative's, doctor. You're right. Thanks to you that is true. Else these are times when the son tells his father... he flatly refuses to marry. What is the matter, doctor? What can I say, Nawab? It appears as though this pain will subside... only after killing me. God forbid, doctor! I mean it. I wanted Yusuf to marry while I'm still alive. But the sons these days do not pay heed to anything... and flatly refuse you to your face. Has Yusuf turned down marriage? Yes. My niece Razia and his alliance was fixed... ten years ago with my permission. Little did I know... Yusuf would disgrace me thus in my final days. Don't lose heart. I shall talk to him. In fact, I have the right to scold him if need be. But what does he say? Find out for yourself. Because I feel it would be best... for him to get engaged within a day or two. Yusuf, please come here. Coming. Greetings, sir! God bless you! Yusuf, you passed your medical exam... and yet you did not treat me to sweets? Yes. How long will you continue working at the hospital? - Another two months. - And afterwards? I shall set up my own clinic and start practicing. Yusuf, I fail to understand... how an obedient son like you could refuse. Especially when your father is in this condition. Why are you objecting to marry Razia? She's family. Well-known, accomplished, and pretty. And most interesting is that she is of the same blood. That's right. Another thing. This is the seventh generation... where the girls and boys have married within the family. Yes. My family is the same. We would rather lose our lives... before the girls and boys marry outside the family. That is the pride of the family. But, sir, may I say something? How can an uneducated wife please her educated husband? What nonsense! When we got married... the wives weren't very literate. Just the basic home education, and good upbringing... which I regard far better. But, sir, your family is a whole other matter. The education and upbringing is far better in your family. You see? God, please grant me quick death... so I don't have to hear any more of this. - Doctor... - Yusuf, you dare to insult my family to my face! - That's not what... - When your own kin says such things... - to whom will we marry our daughters? - But, father... I have given my word for this match ten years ago. This promise cannot be broken. - Either you marry her or I will commit suicide. - Doctor! If I had a son like this I would shoot him dead. The father's condition is so bad and he refuses to marry? Fool! I feel he is in love with a girl. That is the reason for his refusal. Be that as it may! Yusuf's refusal to marry at this time... is practically the same as to going against God. Yes, that is true. Do parents rear and educate their children for this? So that the father makes his will at his deathbed... while the son refuses marriage. Such children are better off dead at birth. You are right. The world just does not care these days. Well, I am going out for a while. Where to? I'll go visit the doctor. Then I shall try to persuade him. Perhaps he will concede. Tilak... tell him I have heard everything. It would be best for him to pay heed to the elders. That is no longer possible. I am helpless. Try to forget me. I tried. But I could not forget you. I could be disgraced if you take another step. I have come too far. I cannot revert now. Family honor is the greatest thing in my opinion. And love? Is that of no importance in your opinion? I told you I am helpless. If you insist you will lose me forever. What did you say? Lose you forever? Yes. What do you have to say now? Nothing. Your wish is my command now. Because my life depends on your well-being. This is not a command. I am requesting you. One last request. If the whole world insisted I would not have agreed. But I am obligated to you. You need not worry. I shall agonize my entire life... but I will not bring disgrace on you. Mr. Yusuf, do you agree to marry Razia... daughter of Ahmed Hussain for a dowry of one thousand coins? I accept. Continue singing, for it is spring. Sing The sorrow of love makes me cry There's happiness all around It is spring all around There's grief all around Life is full of pain My smile is like the moonlight, my joy is like spring In my opinion, without you flowers are like thorns to me There is no sorrow today My heart is at peace You have inflicted this sorrow on me That is why I love this sorrow Sing. Sing. I sacrifice myself for you Continue singing, for it is spring. Sing The sorrow of love makes me cry Sister, this time you have come after a long time. Goodness! My eyes yearned for a glimpse of your face. I was longing to come too. But I did not have the time. Now tell me, how is Najma? She is a little better now, sister. God bless you, my child. Why did you take the trouble? To welcome you. Bless you! Do you see how much she cares for me? You are right. Go get some rest, my child. Go. It is always such a pleasure to see Najma. She is a lovely girl. May god bless her! Have a seat, sister. Well, have you fixed a date as yet? Yes, sister. Sister, Najma is your own child. Who in the family could be better than Mukarram? Just tell us when. But there is one problem. It has only been a while since the Doctor passed away. Yes I heard. I was very sorry. But I'm glad he got his son married during his lifetime. This marriage took place with great difficulty, sister. We are glad Yusuf conceded at my insistence. He has great respect for me. God bless him. He is a good boy. Yes. So how long will you wait? Just another week. His final obsequies are on this Sunday. You are aware the late doctor was my close friend. After that it is up to you. Anytime you wish. I feel any day soon should be good. As you wish. - What do you say? - Certainly, sister. - Ma'am... - What? Ma'am... Why don't you say what you wish to say? I know what you want to say. I know why my aunt came. Shall I tell you what's going to happen? Who is that? Why is she pushing her way forward? She is Dr. Yusuf's wife, Razia. Is this Razia? Yes. Tell me, did you like the pretty bride? Not so great. She's alright. Please don't say that in my presence. I'm sorry. I don't know how to mince words. I only call a spade a spade. Do you agree to marry Nawab Mukarram... for a dowry of ten lakh rupees? Say yes, my girl. Just as your mother and you grandmother said yes. Say it. Say yes, my girl. No need to feel shy. Just say yes. Hmm... Congratulations! Congratulations! Burn, burn. Burn, oh moth. Burn down to ashes Nobody understands your pain Only the victim understands Burn away silently Burn, burn. Burn, oh moth. Burn down to ashes Do not narrate your tale of woes, you silly Do not make the smiling ones cry, you silly Burn away with a smile Unite. Go unite with your flower, oh honeybee Strangers don't appreciate your pain Only a family member would understand Go meet up with your own ones Unite. Go unite with your flower, oh honeybee Do not wander from bough to bough, you silly Don't stumble in a falsely inebriated condition Come to your senses and unite Unite. Go unite with your flower, oh honeybee Unite Your song was good, Razia. You sing well. Even you sing well. But your song had a modicum of pain. Perhaps your voice is such. And how about your song? It was a dance of joy. Tell me something. I know you are the moth. But where is the fire? And where is she blazing? Fire? She is present in my own house. Don't you see the bright lights all around? Thank you. By the way, I saw Najma. She isn't very pretty. Ever since you have returned from the wedding... you've done nothing but criticize the bride. Don't you have anything better to do? Bride? Don't you mention her by name? What is the big deal in mentioning her name? Razia. Najma. I can mention everybody's name. But you are aware my late father was the Nawab's employee. I owe my education and this house to the Nawab. That's why I don't feel right criticizing that family. Sure. Why would you tolerate criticism of that family? Just what do you read all day long? How do I explain it to an illiterate like you? How can I practice if I don't study? You talk nonsense. Why marry me when I am illiterate? Father knew the answer to that. You should have asked him. Or you can go home and ask uncle. That means they forced you into this marriage. You did not wish to do so. Why are we debating this issue now? I just returned from the clinic. I haven't even rested after eating. That's why I'm telling you to sleep. Read it in the morning. Eighteen. Eighteen. It is eighteen! The dice are askew. Look properly. - No, it is not askew. - It is askew. - No, it isn't. - It is askew. You cheat this way. I refuse to play with you. Please get some sleep now, ma'am. You go to bed. I will sleep later. When? At whatever time he comes in. How long will you wait for the master? For as long as there is life left in my eyes. Ma'am, this world is a strange place. Only some kings and jewelers recognize pearls and diamonds. What do you mean? If you had married Yusuf... Tilak! What nonsense is this? You are sinning and you are making a sinner of me as well. Have you no shame mentioning a strange man this way? - Yusuf is a stranger? - Yes. He's been a stranger to me since the nuptials. My Nawab is my faith, my world, and my duty hereafter. I'm shocked... you could say such a thing despite being brought up with me. Madam! What is the matter with you? You do not understand as yet? Let me make it clear. A girl buries her desires, her hopes and love of dear ones... at her maternal home. She gets married... and only leaves her husband's home after death. You will return home tomorrow morning. I do not need you any more. Ma'am... Not Ma'am. I am someone's wife now. I wish to obey all of my husband's commands. But my order remains unchanged in your case. - Get out of here! - But you require a companion. Tilak, I no longer need a confidante. This is my greatest confidante. God's wish is my command hereafter. Is this the only outcome of love? Thousand of woes and only one innocent heart My world is so very dark Even the morning is twilight in my opinion I understand this from my heartbeats... that life is another name for anxiety I am pleased with my broken heart, therefore... again today your name comes to my lips Is this the only outcome of love? Are you finished singing? Yes. I thought you were studying. Yes, I felt like singing for a change. Sing some more. I'm done singing. I shall sing again when I wish to. Why would you want to sing now? - What do you mean? - I am here. No, that's not the reason. If I am in the mood I'll sing again. Wait for a little while. Mood? Why don't you say if you miss someone? Miss whom? Could be anyone. God forbid anyone falls in love... and be unsuccessful. You are bringing up the same topic again? Are you offended? I bet she is yearning for you over there. And here you... - Vile woman! - What did you say? If you ever malign anyone I shall break your bones. - You'll break my bones? - Yes! Yes? Oh My God! Hit me some more. Hit me some more. It was my misfortune I got married to you. - What's the matter? - Nothing. So why is she crying? How would I know? You find everything I say taunting. I will go home to my mother's home. Go away! All of you, leave. Roshan, you stay here. Water. You? Why did you take the trouble? Where the hell are all the maids? I forbade them to do any work. Why? So that I may serve you. But this is not your job. Yes, you are right. But I have no other means to get near you. Excuse me. I got so tied up playing dice last night... Please take a seat. Was the game too complicated? Yes. Nawab Nabban had only one coin left... and both my warriors were still alive. What happened next? I cornered the coin for hours. So did you win or lose? By your grace, nobody can compete with me at this time. Possibly your warrior was left behind. Yes. It seemed so. What? Do you know how to play the board game? Just a wee bit. Would you like to play? Sure. A good deed needs no permission. Is this bet acceptable? Or do you want to play another match? You think I lost this match? Hold on, I'll be back shortly. - Agha Hazar. - Yes sir. Come here. Not you, only Agha Hazar. Yes Master. I'm playing backgammon with my wife. And I am losing. What's her position on the board? The wife has lost both warriors. Only one coin remains. - What about you? - I have both my warriors intact. - So play another board. - What? Play another board? Play another board? And you consider yourself an expert? Get out of here! Go! Forgive me. It took me a while. Nawab Zaki is a great player of backgammon. He came to consult me for a good move. I see. So you accept this bet? Do you know how to play chess? Just a wee bit. Would you like to play? Yes, come on. There. Check. It is too early for that. Here goes. And that is mate! Don't disturb this board. I'll return right away. Abban! Yes sir. Come here. Not you. Only Abban. Yes, my Lord. I am in a game of chess with my wife and I am losing. What is the position of the board, sir? My king is in check. Then play your knight. Even the knight is dead. Then play the rook. The rook is also dead. In that case, play a new game, sir. - Play a new game? - Yes. And you guys consider yourself experts at the game? I've spent lakhs of rupees on you guys. Get out of here! Sit, sit. What are you playing, my dear? He asked me to join him for a game of chess. Don't play chess with Mukarram, my girl. He plays very well. Many time he has been invited to play by the foreigners. Mukarram please play your turn fast... as we're getting late for the meal. Okay, we'll play more after eating. But now, what move is left? The game is lost! Yes. Oh, okay. You were supposed to have gone abroad to play. Just as well you didn't go... or you would have acted thus out there as well! They would have called you unsporting. So now Yusuf has started to dare hit my sister! He had wed her for this only? Chhabban just come with me. Chhabban's father? What is it? Both the brothers have gone to thrash up Yusuf. What? Look Razia I have told you many times... you should never complain against your husband. Come with me to your home. No Dad. I will not go. - Come on. I'll drop at your home. - No. Get up! Doctor, what do you advise for diet? - Take something light. - Very well! Mohammed Ali. Yusuf! Brother Chhabban. Why did you raise a hand to hit Razia? I never hit her. You mean she is lying? Brother Wasim, I merely scolded her. Scolded her? But why? She behaved rudely. You have become very arrogant after becoming a doctor. Come and apologize to her. Or know that your guts will be out of your belly! Look, I've always regarded you as elder brothers... but remember I have the same blood in my veins as you have... - and now I cannot take this any more. - What do you say? Stop this! Do not butt in this father! Get out! llliterates! If you are my sons... then even Yusuf is the son of my late brother. Go and embrace him. Go ahead. Now go back home! Ill-mannered fools! Son, I have brought back Razia again to your house. Yusuf you must take care of her. She is illiterate... but you are educated. Uncle, I never did anything to her. I expect that only from you! It seems the Nawab will not come today either. So will we have to fly the kites without him today? - How will we do that? - Why? Where are the kites and the strings? Oh, you are worried about kites and strings... but since yesterday my birds are without any feed. After all, what about these innocent creatures? But this had never happened earlier. Oh dear. I hear that the board and... chess players have been turned out from service! And now it is our turn. For God's sake do not speak black words. So this is all the doing of the new wife. Surely there is no doubt in that. You people can go away. The Nawab will not come outside today either. Dear lady, please inform us... at what time will the Nawab come... to the music and dance sitting in the evening... so we shall come in time. Don't bother. He won't go there, either, today. But listen, this function was arranged as per his wish. So it is cancelled as per his wish. Very well. Did you all see? Now utter black words! Come on now. Why are you sitting? Get up! My lover's eyes are magic arrows. I surrender myself My beloved's eyebrows are bows. I surrender myself! The eyes' arrows are too much Those eyelashes shoot me with spears... yet they are the life of this wounded one The bow-string is made of love My heart is like the breeze The eyes are like the flying kite My beloved's eyebows are bows. I surrender myself My lover's eyes are magic arrows. I surrender myself Left playing the board game... Left playing the chess game... only connected to the game of Love Sir. Who is the letter from? Collector. What does he write? He has written regarding the revenue from the village. Just ask the accountant to respond to it. But the letter is addressed to you. Yes it is. So unless you tell him what to write back... how will the accountant know what to reply? I don't usually bother with these matters. These matters of accounts are too complicated. So what? You can make an effort. Go and tell the accountant that the reply will be sent later. Please read out the letter to me. What does it say? What a trivial matter you're taking up. Is this the right time for it? Listen... today we've forgotten something. What? Chess! Yes, that's it! Come on, let's play! I shall win all the games today! Hmm, we'll see about that. Okay, let's see. Here you are, madam. Your king is in check. I seem to be losing many games today. You have won many a game too. Oh yes, even the smartest of players gets defeated by... a very small negligible confusion. This bloody confusion is like that only. Every game has this rule. So much so that the game of life which is considered... to be the toughest is lost by the slightest confusion. Well, what is this game of life? Pray teach me too! I am trying to. Just consider this, in chess, what to say of the pawn? Even the king gets defeated by a wrong move! But initially the mistakes of the pawns... only lead matters to the queen and king. Correct! But if the King remains alert at his own station... and so does the queen, and so also the pawns... Then there is no question of defeat. All will discharge their own duties. Yes, and this is the game of life. Now just consider... for instance, your accountant. Let's say he is the queen and all other employees are pawns. Whether or not they are performing their respective duties properly... else God forbid... one day the king is liable to be in trouble. And thus the winning game of life is bound to be lost. Very correct. Thanks! Today you have opened my eyes. Don't worry. Let us finish this game... and this one you are going to win. We shall play chess later. As of today let me take the accounts from the accountant. Oh Lord! By your Grace, today I have won the game forever. Greetings to you, Sir. Greetings. Why did sir take the trouble today? I have some work with you. You need money, sir. It shall be done, sir. No sir. Not the money... rather I need the accounts for the money. Accounts of which money, sir? How many years has it been since my late father passed away? Four years sir. Four years? So I need the accounts only for the last four years. But your late Father, may he rest in heaven... he never asked to see any accounts. But I want to see the accounts. Accounts for last three years have already been submitted, sir. - For how many days is it remaining? - Only the current year, sir. Then let me have the accounts for this year. - Then... - What do you mean by 'then'? As you say sir. Rs. 20,000 came in as revenue... - of which Rs 3,000 went as taxes. - Sir. So why does the book have an entry... of only 15,000 instead of 20,000? Where is the Rs. 5,000? Er, perhaps there is an error in account. Error in account? You've been working for last three hours yet there's an 'error in account'? Sir, kindly give me time till tomorrow. I have forgotten the ledger-book at home. Should it be kept at home home, or here in the office? Sir, kindly give me time till tomorrow. Very well then. But you will have to produce the accounts for the Rs. 20,000... fully tallied and complete. Please note that you've been serving here since my father's time. So I am lenient. Otherwise I would have had you sent to jail. And tomorrow if you are unable to account for the Rs. 20,000... then for God's sake you need not come here. Is that clear! Greetings, madam! Come Tilak! What brings you here? Just came over to see you, madam. Tilak, I am extremely happy today. It is a very auspicious day. Today I have achieved my purpose. Tilak, you do not look happy. Are you not glad in my happiness? May the Lord keep you happy, forever. But Madam... Tilak... But Madam, you have earned this joy... after ruining someone's life. - Yusuf... - Stop it Tilak. Again you have started the same story. Leave here. I say this because he will listen to none except you. Now I cannot say anything to him. As you wish... but you should remember that he entered into this marriage... only upon your bidding... and now in this situation it is your duty to save his life. I very well realize this duty... but my duty stops me. I cannot do this. Tilak I am married. I belong to... someone now. Tilak go away. Just go away. Madam. Whenever I remember you... I feel a pang in my heart I shed tears, silently... while the world sleeps To whom can I tell my tale of woe? None can share my misery Oh come. Oh come. My heart is not at peace Someone waits for you... desperate with his life Slowly... slowly tread the path in love You may not lose. The path is very tough Are you remembering someone? Pain is written on your face Wipe those tears from your eyes Do not feel miserable, my lord Slowly, slowly tread the path of love You may not lose. The path is very tough Slowly, slowly Razia, come here. You called for me? Or is it my imagination? Yes, I did call for you. Please come here. Please sit. What? Yes, please sit down. Today I want to take a decision with you. Decision? Why do you need me for it? Do whatever you feel like doing. More than I, you are needed for this decision. Really? Then tell me. You are aware that we have to lead this life together... and in this very house. I am aware. Now it is up to you, whether you make this house a hell... or live here peacefully. You want to take a decision orally or from the heart? From the heart. Decisions can be taken by heart only when... you throw away the memory of someone from there. Look Razia, my mind is at its wit's end... because of your 24-hour nagging. I cannot do any work, anywhere. My practice is halved. I am ill-famed in town for my confusion. None except you has a remedy for this. I am prepared to treat you, but just tell me... have you ever tried to cure my wounded heart... or have you always been rubbing salt on it? I know you are my husband. I know very well my duty. But I'm helpless. Have you ever realized that I am your wife? Have you ever addressed me lovingly as Razia? You are forever lost in just one thought. You mean I should see my house being destroyed and... not even utter a sigh? Razia! Just listen. Would you prefer we not reach any decision? Both our lives may remain a living hell? Don't act crazy and don't make me crazy either. Call me crazy or whatever. I have become mad and I will make you mad too. I'll enjoy it when this house burns. We two mad ones will also burn... and I'll laugh like mad. - You did not give them medicine. - You were absent. Repeat yesterday's dose. Doctor, I want to say something. I shall not see anyone today. You all repeat yesterday's dose. - Doctor... Take yesterday's medicine! Bless me that I made you a hearty romantic! Bedil... Bedil, right now I am in no mood for fun. Just go away. Have you lost your head completely, my dear? I say, you had better go home now. Else you will kill me? Stop joking. I am very serious, and you call it joke. Better go home and say these serious things. Go. Yusuf, come to your senses. I'm senseless and want to remain so. I won't let you be senseless. You are my only friend. Today there's no other doctor as important as you in town. I'm proud of this. You have toiled for this position just so that you may waste it thus... squander it for a useless thing... that you can never get come what may? Stop this nonsense. I don't want to hear this. Go away from here. I shall not go till I bring you back to your senses. You'll bring me to my senses? Yusuf sir, madam is unwell. They have sent for you. I won't come. The nawab has called you. I won't go anywhere. Yusuf sir, the junior madam is sick. - What? - Najma is unwell. - Najma? - Yes. I shall come along. Let's go. Come doctor. I was waiting for you. Please come. Mukarram, let him see the pulse urgently. Very well. I have the thermometer. Here. Doctor? Yusuf? I shall immediately go and get the medicine. I sing... sing in joy I wipe away all the woes I make the weeping ones smile He would call me. I would not go to him I would tease him some more. I sing Come hear the story of the world from me Misery is the old age of the heart... and joys its youth Then why should I not sing? I sing... sing in joy You liked my song? Very good. Sing some more. Madam, I am always scared... some day you may not utter my name for all... that I have told you in confidence. Even if I were to say, who would believe it? Well Madam, the entire town knows... that I am to be wed to Nawazish Ali - Okay, tell me something. - Yes? When I saw Nawazish Ali standing outside the garden... was Najma herself talking to him, or... No Ma'am, the messages were exchanged, though. I have heard other news. What? Nawazish Ali came this morning. He said Najma is seriously ill... and Mr. Yusuf is laboring hard for her treatment. Get my palanquin. Go. Najma. God forbid. How is your health? I am okay, by your good wishes. Except for wishing well, what else can we do? What do we poor folks have that we can give you? Wherever we see friendly folks we pray for their good. Your good wishes are very valuable. Don't say that. Along with good wishes... my husband's medicines are also very valuable. I would like to give you some good wishes, in private... so please ask these ladies to leave us alone. I hope you don't mind. Sir, please do not go inside. Why not? Mr. Yusuf's wife has come. Yes? Now tell me. I am wondering... do I begin the tale of my destroyed home and your kindness on me... right from beginning or from the recent times? You mean to say, I have destroyed your home? No, no, you are absolutely innocent. This is like the proverbial dame who ignites a spark and stands back. Razia, you misunderstand. Some foe has misinformed you. Najma, you initially started the spark while I kept quiet. But I notice that the sparks of your beauty still burn my house. What do you want to say? That now you will yourself have to burn, too... in the same fire started by you. Before the wedding you kept meeting with Tilak. I never did mind. Razia... he loved you or you loved him. I never did mind. - Razia... - But now you have no right to... instigate this fire more under the guise of your illness. Razia! Why have you called me? Just relax for a while. I shall tell you. I don't have leisure. Nor do I wish to meet you. Bedil... I need to apologize. That day I raised a hand on you... I wasn't in my senses. I went many times to your place... but could not meet you. Please pardon me my friend. Cut out that nonsense, else I shall give you one. It is too hot. Take off your cap. You want to hit me? Come do it. Yes. What? Yes. Yusuf sir, you must leave there right away. Mukarram Nawab is coming there with a pistol to kill you. Go somewhere quickly. What is it? Mukarram is coming with a pistol to kill you. Mukarram is coming with a pistol to kill me? Yes. Then let him come. Who is afraid here? Don't be crazy. Come along come with me. That is not possible. Now I'll be alone here. Do you want to die? I died the day Najma got married. Come with me or I'll kill you and myself too. That's the same thing, Mr. You'll kill me or not. Yusuf, come. For God's sake come. You are my friend. I won't let you die. Are you so scared about my death? My dear, death is heaven. Yusuf don't be obstinate. For God's sake come. There is no hope left. An operation is useless. You please try. I have already examined. There is no hope. You, doctor? Now the operation is useless. Nothing can be done. Doctor, I am ready to give away all my wealth. For God's sake cure him back. Nawab, sir, wealth can buy you everything except life. I am sorry. I am helpless. Helpless. Yusuf, Yusuf has not come! Is Dr. Yusuf there? Hello? Dr. Yusuf? Oh, Nawab sir? Tell me? Yusuf, my child, why have you not come till now? Mukarram's condition is so critical... you will have to perform the operation. All the other doctors have refused. Please come immediately. Sir, it's better if the operation is performed at the hospital. No, the operation will take place at home. You come right away. Okay, I'll be right there. 595. Hello? It is me, Dr. Yusuf. All instruments, nurses, oxygen, etc... for the operation must be sent immediately to Mukarram Nawab's residence. Yes, yes, I am operating. Send it now. Why are you doing this operation? Is there no other doctor in town? All other doctors have given up. The Nawab insists that I should do the operation. Why do you drag the Nawab's name? Najma must have asked you. Razia, you have crossed all limits. This is a question of life or death for a person. For a doctor there can be nothing greater than this. Move! I don't have time. Not a question of life, only of death. What nonsense! Not nonsense. I speak the truth. After ages you have now got the opportunity. You and Najma have together planned to kill Mukarram. Afterwards, the coast will be clear for you both. Villain, go away. You cannot do the operation. Leave me, else the patient may die. I don't have time. If you go there, I shall tell the senior Nawab that... you want to kill Mukarram. - I say leave me. - No. You all please move aside. Preparations for operation are going on. No point in crying. This is delicate. Mr. Yusuf, you came too late. What happened, Yusuf? Nothing. I had fallen on the staircase in my hurry. - Where is Mukarram. - Come. Yusuf, you're that father's son who was my great friend. And I feel towards you as I do my son. God has given me just one daughter. Please try that her life is not ruined. Yusuf, sir, the young mistress wants to tell you something. Tell her I'm in a hurry. Tell him that I shall take back my husband from him. Tell her I am not God. But By God I shall spare no effort. Mukarram... I just want to say one thing. Perhaps you do not know that... every doctor has given up on you. But I was ready to take this major risk and... agreed to operate upon you. Only so that if by God's grace you become well again... then I may be able to clear this misunderstanding in your mind. Najma is innocent. She is yours. She loves only you. If you still don't believe this... then here is the pistol... and here am I. Tell her, congratulations, the operation has been a success. Yusuf... Congratulations, the operation was successful. Yusuf, God knows... you have done me a favor that cannot... be forgotten in my entire life. What are you saying, sir? I have always taken favors from you. I have just done my duty. So finally you have killed? No, the operation was successful. I am going to meet Razia. Now you are going to see her when she has died. She's died? How can that be possible? I just came from there. While dying she said... 'please ask my master to forgive me'. 'My misunderstanding is cleared'. 'It was all my fault'. Now what is there? If she were alive I would have pardoned her. Still, Yusuf, please pardon her. The dead lady's soul will be at peace. Just once say that you have pardoned her. Razia, I have pardoned you. My God has pardoned you. My lord and master, if you have pardoned me then come home! Bless me, that I made you a hearty romantic.
