Sarla's daughter must have grown up. How old would she be? - About eight years old. - Eight years. Yes, it's been a long time. Mother and Sarla are coming to meet you today. - Come. - Come. Manisha, are you here? Yes. You didn't let anyone come to the jail. So I waited outside. Really? So you waited for me all these days? Yes, Vicky. And besides that before dying, Uncle.. You've not changed at all. You're exactly the same. Not a single grey hair. Calm and serious. You look like a Professor of Philosophy. What are you saying? A murderer.. Stop it. Come. Come, Mr. Pritam. (Whistling) (Horn Honking) (Tires Screeching) Who is this? He comes here every day. He's a very wealthy boy. He has a very big factory in Bombay. - Yes. - He's a millionaire. If he's a millionaire, what is he doing in our slum? - Somu, Mr. Chaudhary's son. - Yes. He's his best friend. After Mr. Chaudhary's death, he pays for all the house expenses. This is what you call a friend. Don't say friend. Somu must be his stooge. No, they're true friends. After passing law they worked at the same place. They eat, go out and have fun together. Yes, they've fun too? - Mother, Somu isn't ready yet? - He's getting dressed. He'll be here. Will you've tea? - If I get it, I will. - I'll just bring it. Somu. - You've not gone to college? - Give me fees for college. Where are my sweets? Sarla, give him a full box. No, Mother, I've to go to office now. If you give me a boxful of sweets, how will I work? I'll lose a good job. Listen. Give me a few in my hands. - Yes? - Yes. - Go and get it. - Okay. - Give it. - Here. So, how is work? Good. Just lets us learn a bit more. Then we could open our own office. - Really? - Yes. But if you work yourself, how will you get lawsuits? We're not just any lawyers. Lawsuits will find us. Yes. And if you don't get lawsuits.. Brother Somu and you.. Can file cases on each other. That is fantastic. She isn't as stupid as I thought. She's much more than that. (Laughing) (Laughing) Your clothes are like similar too. How would I know this fool would wear this? And look, twin watches. Yes. One for that fool, one for me. Here. - Vicky. - First change your clothes. Or you'll look like fools in front of the barrister. Go. Police say the corpse was.. In the room for 96 hours. This is for sure. But what can prove that the corpse was dacoit Ram Singh's? Rather, one thing shows that the body might be somebody else's. And that thing is the watch on the hand of the body.. Which was working when the police found the body. No watch can work without charging for 96 hours. Brilliant, sir. Yes, beautiful. Have you made a list of properties? - Yes. - Show it to me. It was somewhere here.. Give it to me. I say, give it to me. Please leave my office immediately. I said get out. Okay. Pen. Useless fellow. - Somu. - Yes, sir. I'll be back in a minute. Jot down whatever I have told you. (Music Playing) Shridhar. - Somu. - Yes? I've to go some place. By tomorrow prepare all the lists. - Can I trust you? - Definitely. Thank you very much. - So, could I leave? - Okay. Teresa, take this file and type it. - Good bye. - Bye. - Good bye Miss Teresa. - Bye. Brilliant boy. He'll become a big barrister someday. Excuse me, sir. Barrister or an artist? What do you mean? (Laughing) - I am surprised. - Why? That day you get out me from office and now you are respecting me. This is office. Everything have to do legal. That's why I resigned. Vikram, his future is in dark. - Why? - Just see. We're bound like a criminal and a witness. This tie can never be broken. The lawyer who doesn't know this, can't fight a case. Wow! You are imagine. Really? Let us celebrate this freedom. - Yes. Today we're not working for anyone. - Correct. Cheers. (Music Playing) - Vicky. - Yes? That blue one is mine. No, you take the yellow one. She's more beautiful. I'll take the blue one. No. I want blue one, friend. No. What kind of a man are you? Can't you sacrifice for a friend? Vicky, you take both. Right. "Your lover is lonely.." "Without you, beloved." "Your lover is lonely without you, beloved." "Your lover is lonely without you, beloved." "I've gone crazy, Oh, Lord." "I've gone crazy, dear, without you." "Your lover is lonely without you, beloved."

"Your lover is lonely without you, beloved." "Your lover is lonely without you, beloved." - Very good. - Very good. Hurry up. Aunt, it's fallen here. Aunt, let's have one more folk song. Not a folk song, but classical one. Yes. One song more. Yes, Madam. Let's have another song. Yes. It'll surely take place. But after you leave. What are you saying, sir? Every interested person is invited to this gathering. Sir, I do not know much Urdu. It's simple. Do not stand up without a smile or else.. - Oh, my God. - Oh, my God. Stand up. Sit down, Nabob. I told you to stand up. I told you to sit down. - We'll hear this last song alone. - Yes. Stand up quietly. Stand up. Don't do sit-ups. I told you to sit down. He won't go out. We'll make him. - Forget it. - What are you doing? What are you doing? Sit, Nabob. Tall fellow.. - What are you doing, Aunt. - You scoundrels. Jhumroo. What are you doing? Don't be insolent. Come out. I'll teach you a lesson, fool. Go. I've seen many loafers like you. He acts smart. - "When the ring tinkles, it's delightful.." - Quiet. Shreenath. Take off the shoes. Vicky, shall I go? - Okay. - Okay. How will you go? Why? In a taxi. No. No. I'll not let you go by a taxi. Then what should I do? Walk. Why? Am I dead? - I'll drop you. - No. Never. I know after dropping me you'll drive back.. At a speed of 80 miles.. And I'll worry whether you've reached home or not. And I don't even have a telephone. - Don't you have a telephone? - No. One minute. One minute. - Vicky. - One.. Vicky. What are you doing? Take this telephone. Vicky, keep this phone down. - Go to sleep. - Yes. - Go to sleep. - Yes. All right. I'll sleep. Mother, will worry all night. Let her. - She's a mother. - Yes. No. This is very bad. - Mother will worry? - Yes. So I'll tell Mother and return. - Yes. - Yes. You go and tell Mother. She'll worry. I'm sleeping. That's like a good boy. - So, shall I go? - Yes. - Okay? - Okay. - How will you go? - In a taxi. No. I'll not let you go in a taxi. - I'll drop you. - We've come to the same point. Okay. I'll not go. Go to sleep. No, it's very bad. Mother will worry. You go. I'm sleeping. Go. How will you go? Am I dead? Mother. Mother. - You've come, son? - Why are you sleeping here? I was waiting for you. I've told you often not to wait for me at night. Go to sleep. Won't you eat food? No, I have already eaten. All right. Brother. You refuse so easily. Mother had made sweets for you today. She kept missing you. Mother made sweets today? Mother, you've made sweets? - Will you eat? - I'll eat a full bowl. And go to sleep. Send it with Sarla. (Bell Tolling) (Dog Barking In Distance) - Will you have it or shall I throw it? - What do you mean? Will this sweet taste nice when you have it? I had asked for it, to eat it, not throw it away. I thought you asked for it to please mother. You've only this much relationship with us. Why are you so rude? Brother, maybe Mother can't tell you. But today I'm telling you what's in her heart. If you can, please start working. Bear the expenses of our house. It's not nice living off Vikram's money. You've gone crazy. He's like me. He's more than a brother. He's dearer to me than my own life. If he spends on us, what is so bad about it? Doesn't he consider Mother as his own Mother? - Doesn't he love you as a sister? - I understand this. But by this, we can't stop people from taunting. Let them talk. I don't care about people. But when people say your brother is a stooge.. Yes, I am. I'm not their stooge. Why do you listen to them? Go to sleep. Go. Take sweets. (Music Playing) "Lamps give light. Flowers give out fragrance." "Lamps give light. Flowers give out fragrance." "But it's very difficult to find friends in this world." "Lamps give light." "When one's friend gets separated from him.." "Don't ask what happens to that person's heart." "When someone's friend gets separated from him.."

Flowers give out fragrance." "But it's very difficult to find friends in this world." "Lamps give light." Very good. This is called a song. You sing well. To me, you're the best singer. - No, don't say that. - Why? Now, people only call me your stooge. If they hear this, they'll call you my stooge. Let them talk, friend. They'll call me your stooge not somebody else's. - But listen. - Yes. - Become a singer. - Okay. You become a drummer. If I sing and you play the drums, we'll be together. - I can play drums even now. - Yes? But I can't play it with rhythm. (Laughing) (Phone Ringing) Hello. Yes. Phone from Bombay? For Vicky? Just hold on, please. One second. Hello. Yes. Yes, Mr. Dhupia? What. When did this happen? Then, why didn't you call the same day? You're a limit. - Now, how is father? - What happened to father? Yes. Yes. I'm coming. Yes. I'm coming. What happened? - What happened to father? - This bloody manager, he's a.. Father had an heart attack three days back. He phoned today. He says, father had said not to inform. Fool. Whose father is he? His or mine? - Call the airport. - Vicky, don't worry. Our friend Omi is there. I'll do something. - Vikram? - How is Dad now? He's fine. There is nothing to worry. You'd be upset, so he had told me not to tell you. - It happened ten days ago. - Ten? What's all this? Doctor was saying it has been ten days. And I've get the news today? It was a minor attack. What would you've done on getting the news? So, why did you even call me today? And why did Dhupia say it happened yesterday? - Fool. - Vicky, sit down. Sit down, my dear boy. Don't get excited. Doctors say there are many reasons for a heart attack. And one of them is excitement. Listen. Get your blood pressure checked. My blood pressure is perfectly fine. Then, where have your manners gone? You came and didn't even wish Nisha. Hello, Nisha. Hello, Vicky. - How is Father? - Fine. And how are you? I'm very fine. Thank you. - That's it? - What else should I say? She'll start lecturing on socialism, communism and politics. You hate talks about socialism. Yes, especially from a millionaire's daughter. If I can get socialism with my millions, I'll surely give them away. But socialism is a system.. Did you see? The lecture has started. But Nisha, I can't understand one thing. Why should we give our millions? God has given us some brains and some strength. He has not made everyone the same. Correct. Now answer me. Uncle, Vicky hasn't changed at all. Vicky? Somu here. How is father? Any problems? No. Nothing to worry about. - Out of danger? - Yes, everything is fine. When will you return? Without you, Delhi is like a jail, friend. I'll be back in a few days. Okay? Somu, do you want anything from here? Ask Mother and then call me. Okay? Dad. I think it's very difficult to think about it. I mean I wanted to think, but I could not think. - What? - Decision. Dad, can't I be on both sides? I'm thinking the same too. Actually, my attack was a minor one. Yet, these stupid doctors tell me not to.. Go to office for the next two months. Now, until I don't go to office, you.. What are you saying, Dad? What will I do there? What do I know about business? In two days, they'll realise I'm a fool. Two days? Uncle, is your staff so dumb? (Laughing) Vicky, when my Father told me about business.. My reply was the same. But in a few days I found out, business is a lot of fun. - I'm sure, you'll also know in seven days.. - No, Dad. This won't happen with me. All right. Go to office tomorrow morning. And listen. If you get bored.. Look at this photograph and think.. How he could have started this business with Rs.200. Wow. Only Rs.200? Great man. Mr. Vikram. Mr. Dhupia, my Grandfather does not look like my Father. These are some papers. Sign on them. - Why? - What? Why should I sign? I haven't signed anything before. Now, you'll do it. You're the Mill partner. Who are the other partners? Your other partner is your Father. Okay. - So, can I talk to my other partner? - Sure. Get me my residence please. Dad. Vicky. Mr. Dhupia has got some papers to be signed. Shall I sign them? Sure, son. But remember one thing. Without reading, never sign any paper. But there are many papers, Dad. So many.. Do I've to read them all? You never read in college. At least read now. Okay. Dad has tricked me. You all are trying to trap me. - Where do I sign? - Here. - Have you checked them? - Properly. - So, shall I sign? - Yes. - Bipin Lal? - Yes. Call him fast. Why did you make him stand outside? - Who is Bipin Lal? - He's a batch clerk here. Batch clerk? Then why are you so worried. - Hello, Mr. Dhupia. - Hello, Mr. Bipin Lal. Come. Sit. Mr. Dhupia, Babban's case hasn't been decided yet. It'll be decided in a day or two, Mr. Bipin Lal. Since two months you have been saying that. What is this? The decision should be made by tomorrow or.. Who is Babban? He's a worker at our Mill. He lost his hand in our machine. The Union is asking for compensation. - Who had placed the hand in the machine? - What? Did I place the hand in the machine or did you? Compensation for what? He too hadn't placed the hand in the machine. You're the boss, so it's your duty.. Do not teach me my duty. The Union has been requesting for the past two months. Decide this matter fast. First you want alms, and you threaten too. It's not a threat, it's a warning. Get out. I said, get out. - What did you do, Mr. Vikram? - What? - Mr. Bipin Lal is the Union Leader. - So what? You can't beg at the point of a gun. Don't give too much importance to a servant. It's not so, Mr. Vikram. They'll go on a strike right now. No. You didn't do the right thing, Vicky. In your anger you've done a foolish act. - Foolishness? A mere clerk threatens me and you.. - Vicky. In business you can't get angry. There is a struggle.. Going on since ages between these two groups. And it'll continue. To win it, you'll have to think of new solutions every day. You'll have to find out new ways. And this is the actual challenge. If you're clever, you'll keep getting work out of them.. And you'll not let them unite. It's a very thrilling game, my dear son. Play it and see. You'll be addicted. As for now apologise to Bipin Lal tomorrow. What? Apologise? When you're sick you take medicines. Why? To cure the illness. Apologise, to take revenge from Bipin Lal in future. Then, I'll consider you my son. Go. Go and do as I say. And listen. The humiliation you feel while apologising.. Shouldn't be forgotten. That will be your strength. Yes, sir. Jay Singh, keep a watch on Vicky. No one should harm him. Don't worry. Till I'm alive no one could harm junior boss. Here. Forget yesterday's incident. I'm sorry. Vicky apologised. Good. Is he very upset? Dhupia, book a seat for him for Delhi today. And tell him I told him to go to Delhi for a few days. Brother, brother Vikram has come. Vicky? Who told you? He's upstairs in your room. He's very sad. Surely, something bad has happened Sad? - Vicky, when did you come? - By the last flight. - How is Father? - He's fine now. What happened? Have you fought with Father? Tell me. - There was a fight, with a pimp. - A pimp? Yes, a pimp. Of the workers. Union Leader. A worker in our Mill. So you ran away from Bombay? Afraid of a worker? Your state is like the one.. Who has over-powered the enemy.. - But is afraid of his next move. - Oh, stop it. Sorry. What happened? Tell me. He's a mere worker and I had to apologise to him in writing. Apologise? Who told you to apologise? Dad. A worker lost his hand in a machine. Tell me, was it my fault? Was it my fault? Tell me everything. Come here. Then? That's it. About this I had a fight with Pandey, that Union man. The workers went on strike and I had to apologise to him. And now I'll have to go to office every day. I'll have to face the man before whom I had begged. Scum. I'll destroy him, Somu, I'll finish him. How long does it take to finish a man? Just give anyone Rs.500, that's it. No, Somu. I do not want to kill him. I want to finish him off. Wipe him off. Tell me what to do? Vicky. I want to go to Bombay with you. Will you come really? Give me a job. Don't worry. I'll arrange for a manager's job. No, of a worker. What? Brother, this is the new boss. Salutations, Sir. - Who is he? - Who? The one with the band on the head? Chander. A new apprentice. - Who has hired him? - The manager, not me. Someone recommended him. But he's a good worker. He'll learn the work. Not only work, teach him how to greet too. - Chander. - What is it? Don't you know him? - Who? - The one who just left. He's our boss. Sir's son. - So? - Why didn't you greet him? Will I get paid for work or for greeting him? You'll die. You'll lose your job. Go, do your work. Fool. Do it fast. Why are you taking time? - I'm doing it, artisan. - Do it. I do not understand anything. First, you said you'll work in the Mill. Now, you're staying in the colony. What is all this? Vicky, tell me from your heart.. Do you want to take revenge on Bipin Lal or not? I want to take revenge.. Honestly, Somu. Finishing Bipin Lal is the biggest aim in my life. I'm afraid to set foot in the Mill. If he comes in front, I change my ways. I feel like.. You want to finish Bipin Lal. But do you know Bipin Lal's position with the workers? - What? - They take him to be God. He can't be deposed. Then? I'll have to become greater than him in front of the workers. And for that it's important to know them closely. Each one's name, address, house and everything. It isn't possible without staying with them. Hence, I've rented a house in the colony. I should not even come here. If anyone sees, all our doing will go to waste. Who will come 20 miles away from the Mill to see you? - What if someone comes? - Don't talk nonsense. If you don't want to come here, no need to go there. Okay, fine. I'll come late at night. - But friend, I can't mentally adjust all this. - What? You'll have to stay in the colony. If you weren't my friend.. - I'd be staying in the colony. - Shut up. Now, I'll become a leader and give speech. Brothers and sisters. If a worker who doesn't work.. For a day, then his family starves that day. People of India, open your eyes and see the truth. And see the poverty strewn all around you. See how unhappy and helpless the people of our country are. So, we'll have to fight. We'll have to make every poor man, rich and every rich man, poor. Yes. And make every village a city and every city a village. Applause. Very good. You've made a great beginning. This is just the beginning. See what happens next. - Cheers. - Cheers. Are you drunk? It's the same thing, friend. Give me either a drink or sorrow. Liquor is drunk and we drink tears too. What? Repeat it. The pain of the heart isn't repeated, friend.' 'It's like a flame which isn't brought to the lips again.' Very good. You're a great poet. What is your name? - Name? - Yes. - Alam. - Alam. Brother Alam, where do you stay? The road is our nest.' There is no house to stay, the whole world is mine.' Right now beside Aunt's house.. Who is this Aunt? Does she sell liquor? Don't say that. The poor lady sells liquor. If the government comes to know, they'll get her. Yes. If someone sells hunger and thirst.. Let it be. Shall we go to Aunt's place for one more? Yes. Let's go. What happened? Let it be. Some other time. Why? You've no money? Don't worry. I'll pay. Come. - Come, come. - Come. Friend, there is a hole, be careful. One, two and three. - Come, friend. - Yes. You've come again. Wait, Aunt. I've not come here, I've been brought here. Enough. There's no need for poetry. I do not come here to sing poetry. - I want liquor. - There isn't liquor. - It's not there? - Don't say that. What will happen to your business? Business will shut down. But you'll not get liquor. - I won't get it? - No. All right. - Come, friend. We'll go to Pascal. - Yes. Go to Pascal's. Do you've money? I don't have money. But he's wealthy. Right, friend? I'm asking you, not him. Aunt, a poor person's hunger, thirst.. Money is all the same. Got it? We don't differentiate that. Take the money and get the liquor. This man will also die someday. Sit. Come, friend. Did you see? This lady does not sell liquor. Since when do you know her? Since my last birth. Even in your last birth, Aunt used to do this? Yes. Even then she used to be loving like this. First eat, then drink. Your eyes have become listless too. Son, first make him eat something. He does not listen. If I stop him here.. He will drink somewhere else. Son, is it? This is a hand bill. See the other side. He was writing on this yesterday. - Yes. - What is written? Please read it. From a pond to the river, from the river to the sea.' A drink is deeper than the sea.' Every evening in my life has been drowned in drink, pal.' I don't know what's paining him. Why does he not want to live? In the hope of living, people are dying.' In the hope of living, people are dying.' In the hope of dying, I'm living.' (Machine Sound) (Sirens Wailing) Accident. Come on. Again someone is hurt. It seems there is an accident in the worker's section. No, the crowd is near the machine section. The machine section has become unlucky. Every month, something or the other keeps happening there. (Crowd Chattering) What happened, Dhondu? Karim's hand got cut. - Which Karim? - Aisha's father. Is he badly hurt? Karim got saved, but his hand is gone forever. God alone knows what he'll do now. What will he do? The Mill will pay a few thousand rupees. He'll live on it as long as he has it. Then he'll die. What else? - Vicky. - Yes? In a way it's good that Karim had an accident. Karim? Who is Karim? The one who lost his arm. You even remember the names of the workers now. Vicky, these small things are very important.. To these small people. In your house there is a driver, a laundry-man. Have you ever called them by names? Just call your driver by his name once. He'll become your slave. It's enough that his boss called him by his name. He was recognised by his name. Friend, you've turned out to be a clever man. These are the tricks of the trade, son. Take advantage of the situation. This hand that has been cut isn't Karim's, but Bipin Lal's. How? I'll tell you. Tomorrow, when you come to the factory.. Sir. I want to talk to you. Yes? Karim's hand got cut. Do you know? Yes, a worker lost his hand yesterday. Yes. The same Karim. Is the value of his hand only worth Rs.2000? What are you trying to say? Karim has two small children and.. A young daughter whom he wants to get married. Besides that he has an old mother, a wife. And it may be two months before.. - He returns from the hospital. - So what should I do? When Karim returns, he should get.. His job back and Rs.5,000 should be paid.. To his family. Money does not grow on trees to demand as much as you want. Even hands don't go on trees.. To be replaced by the other. - The hands that have fed you.. - Shut up. Nobody feeds us. I've done what the law says. I gave him Rs.2000 as per the law. Then remember one thing. You too pass from here every day. Someday, some part of a machine could fall on you. And if unluckily both your arms get cut.. Don't worry. We all will chip in and give you Rs.4,000. Are you trying to threaten me? I don't know about threats. All I know is that if Karim does not get Rs.5,000.. You'll know the value of your arms. If you can, get them insured. You get yourself insured. This company is responsible for you. Not for your family. Got it? What is all this? Move. Why were you fighting? I wasn't fighting, I was asking for a worker's right. This work isn't yours, it's the Union's. What has the Union done? Just got Rs.2,000 for Karim. It is the law. Who made the law? We workers? You think the boss will give Rs.5,000 just like that? Forget the boss, I could even fight the world.. For the rights of the workers. Fight. But do it methodically. What is happening? Mr. Bipin, what is happening? Send the workers to work. This isn't a break time. And Sir has agreed to give Karim Rs.5,000.. And give him his job back. Hail brother Chander. Hail brother Chander. (All Cheering) - It's the festival of colours. - Give me one tea. It's the festival of colours. I don't care. I don't celebrate it. No problem. We'll celebrate it. Leave me alone. (All Cheering) (Music Playing) Whom did you ask before spraying colour on me? Stop harping. Move back. Move back. Why did you put colour on me? It's a way of celebrating the Festival of Colours. A 22 year old woman wants to celebrate Festival of Colours. Shut up. What else you do expect me to do on this festive day? I'll make you celebrate. Go away. Pauper, you can't do anything. - What did you say? - Pauper. - Brother. - Now you remembered brother? - Come. Let's celebrate. - What happened, Chander? When I came out this girl coloured me. - No brother, I.. - No, brother.. - Is she your sister? - Yes. You spoilt his new shirt. Why did he wear it? Didn't he know it's the Festival of Colours. - That it's but.. - What? The one who stayed here before.. Didn't say anything when I had poured hot soup on him.. By mistake once. And he acts smart. - No. - She's insulting me. She called me smart. - No, she said that to me.. - Then it's all right. I'll beat you. Did you make the intoxicating milk? Come. We're coming to drink. Go. - Chander. - Yes? I'll give you the intoxicating milk. Is it strong and addictive? It's called an offering. You'll become flat. What are you saying? - Flat. - What? It's English, you'll not understand. Come. Come, Chander. Sit. Very good. You've made sweets too. - Have you put that in it? - Yes. Then it'll be a lot of fun. Don't even ask. In two pieces.. You eat only one piece. That's enough for 24 hours. - Last year the way you had troubled.. - What had he done? What do you've to do? Am I talking to you? No. Dhondu, you asked. What had I done? Every year you do something new. Sometimes you cry and sometimes you're happy. Take it, brother. The gang is here. I'm going. Go. She's gone. Here, brother. Careful. Hail Lord Shiva. (Music Playing) "In the beauty's courtyard.." "In the beauty's courtyard, colours are showered." "Red colours are sprayed everywhere." "Red colours are sprayed everywhere." "Come, dear." "Come and celebrate this festival." "Let's play with colours." "Let's play with colours." You dance very well. Go away. Don't flatter me. I'm not flattering you. You're a genius. What did you say? You're abusing me in English? No, I'm praising you. Genius isn't an abuse, fool. Fool? Again you abused me. - Do you know the meaning of a fool? - What? Fool means you.. - A beautiful girl. - Yes, a beautiful girl. Why are you flattering me so much? Okay. You dance very badly, all right. Brother, again he's talking in English and keeps saying okay. All right, now forgive him, he made a mistake. Now go get an offering for us. Go. Dhondu, sit. I've made a drink too. Son, take two glasses for them. Dhondu, sit here. - Your sister is innocent. - After all whose sister is she? - She's just like a child. - Whose sister is she? - She's a little idiot. - Whose sister is.. (Laughing) Dhondu, take it. Hail Lord Shiva. Drink it. (Music Playing) "From the pond to the river." "From the river to the sea." "Drink is deeper than the sea." "Drink is deeper than the sea."

What is this? Liquor after cannabis. Watch the fun. It's so much fun. (Laughing) Bholu, it's stuck. It won't open. I told you not to have a drink over cannabis. Now, you've become stoned. Quiet. Quiet. Quiet. Shridhar. - Shridhar. - Yes, sir? - Do you've any dirty sheets? - What? - Dirty sheets. - Dirty sheets? - Yes. - Yes. - Get it. (Laughing) Again air has been filled up. I've become a balloon. Hold me. I'm flying. Leave him. Let him go out of the roof. Hold me. What has happened to you? Brother is drunk, but are you possessed to shout. They've made me drink. Now they will fly with me. All right. Take this medicine. - Give it to him too. - To whom? What is Chander's name? Go ask Chander's name and give it to him too. (Laughing) Again air has been filled up. Hold me. I've become a balloon. Hold it. Wait. Chandu, don't cry. What should I do? What if fingers aren't freed? They'll surely get freed by tomorrow morning. - My fingers. - What happened? - They're stuck. - Show me. - Have they opened? - Yes. Friend they have opened. You all may go now. Very good. - So what was I saying? - Nothing. Then what were you saying? - I was saying eat this and go to sleep. - Yes. I was saying whatever you tell me to eat and I'll eat it. Even if you give me poison I'll eat it. What else is there to eat? Are there any sweets? First, eat this. - What happened? - Look, my hands are stuck on my knees. Why did they get stuck? What now? Why are you laughing? - My hand is now stuck to your friend. - No. You're very beautiful. Say it in English. You're a fool. - You too are a fool. - Oh, god. Good morning, Sir. Can't you greet? I don't like greeting. I can't flatter him. It's not flattery, he's the boss. - So what if he's the boss? - What? So what if he's the boss? You're not even scared about your job. A hardworking man can get hundreds of jobs. I do not care. Go and do your work. Brother, who is Chander? Mine. That's him. Chandu. Sir has called you. Why? What happened to him? Nothing happened to him, it'll happen to you. Go. - He has lost his job. - Yes. - Yes. Come in. - Did you call me, sir? - Yes. Close the door. - Yes? - Close the door. Tell me. You fool. Why didn't you come yesterday? - Don't ask here.. - Don't change the topic. Answer me. Yesterday.. Explain why? Yes. - Good morning, Sir. - Good morning. - Mr. Dhupia isn't well today. He'll not come to the office. - Okay. Answer me. You may go. Now, answer me. - There was a huge problem. - What happened? Yesterday, my hands got stuck. So, you call that, hands getting stuck. I was very ill. You were ill or did you have other things on your mind? - For a girl, you forget your friend. - Talk slowly. - Sorry. - You think I do not know anything. - What do you know? I'll tell you. Last night, I had come to your house. You came to my house in the slum? Yes, son. And I saw that girl who was feeding you. Why did you come there? If anyone had seen you.. - Don't change the topic.. - Don't shout, speak slowly. Sorry. - Who was that girl? - My neighbour. In your arms? Not in my arms, living in the house beside me. - What is her name? - Shama. Shama. So soon you got to know her name too? - Obviously, the girl stay besides me.. - Don't shout. - Sorry. - Will you've a cigarette? - You've lost your mind. - But, Somu.. I'm not Somu, my name is Chander. Mr. Chander. I've to praise your taste. Your Shama is very good. - Did you do anything? - What? - Did you do anything with the girl? - No, friend. I ask why didn't you? When will you do it? When you get old? Did you see? He's young, but does not do anything. - What, sir? - Work. He does not work. Whenever you see him he's talking. Now, go and do something. What, boss? Work. Just name.. Nothing happens by only talking. Got it? Now go. Yes, boss. - And listen. - Yes. - Inform me of your progress. - Yes. Now, you can go. Yes? Why are you moving to and fro? - To get these papers signed. - Really? Give it to me. - Did you read them? - Yes. - So I should sign them? - Yes. Father ordered not to sign anything without reading it. Then? Then sir spoke loudly. I spoke louder than him. I stood in front of him and said, long live the revolution. You said all that to sir? - Yes. - And you weren't scared? (Laughing) I get paid for working, not for greeting. What is happening, friend? - Brother was amazing today. - What did he do? He said a lot to his boss. - Won't he be fired? - What did he say? - What did you say? - Nothing. That conversation with sir. Oh, that. Dhondu was amazing today. I say Shama let's have tea on this. Yes. Take this. This is a dress. For whom? - I don't wear it. - So? - See. - He has got it for you. Wear it. You'll look like a heroine. Listen, Vicky. The Mill's Founder's Day is coming up. The workers think they'll get bonus. Yes, even Father was saying it has to be announced. Do not announce it. Why? If bonus has to be given, we'll not give it easily. We'll create some more drama. So that they feel that if I wasn't there.. They wouldn't have got the bonus. Very good, friend. You are far-sighted. Fantastic. Shake hands. - Somu. - Yes. Your hands have become so hard working on the machines. I don't like it. Vicky, I've left my mother, sister, my house. I'm living in slum. Why? You're dearer to me than my life. Because I had seen tears in your eyes. The one who makes you cry won't live in peace. These hands have not only become hard.. But also strong. Even if someone wants to tear them apart, he couldn't. (Horn Honking) - Who is this? - This must be Nisha. - Nisha? - Yes. - You are wooing a new girl? - No, she's wooing me on Father's request. All right, then I'll leave. - You.. - I know, from the bathroom. (Whistling) Hi. Hello. - What were you doing? - Nothing. Just having whisky. Sit. I was getting bored by myself. - Alone? - Yes. But I can see two glasses. Yes, both are my glasses. This is mine and this is for my friend. Who? There is one in Delhi. - In Delhi? - Yes. - Sure? - Yes, why? Just like that. I felt someone was here before I came. Or was she there? (Laughing) Nisha, you're very clever. And it's very difficult to be friends with clever girls. You? - Son Chander? - Yes. I'm Karim's mother. You're my son from today. These are Karim's wife and children. Brother, I pray to God to give you a long life. Son, your poor mother has made something for you. Eat it at night. God bless you. You've saved us from begging. What happened? What happened? We won't get the bonus we get on.. - Founder's Day. - Why? Boss says this year the profit has been less. The work wasn't less. - The output was the same. - Yes. They say, this year the tax has increased. - So the profit has been less. - My foot. If the tax has increased, the prices have increased too. And the public pay their taxes, not the bosses. Then why won't we get a bonus? You'll not get bonus like this. If you want bonus, go on a strike. Threaten to stop all work. Chander, do not instigate the workers for nothing. Before going on a strike you've to assess your strength too. And you've to see the state of the workers too. And you know next month the monsoons will start too. The ones who are scared of rain can't face the storms, Mr. Bipin. You sleep under your blanket. I'll get the workers a bonus. You're interfering in the Union's work, Chander. I don't stop the Union from doing any work. You too don't stop me. Brothers, I'm going to meet the boss. - You can come if you want. - Yes, let's go. - Stop. Chander. Chander. What is it? What is all this? We've come for our rights. Here. Talk to me. Is this the way to ask for your rights? Rights aren't asked for, but snatched. Every year workers get bonus on this day. We've come to take this year's bonus. What if I don't give it to you? - We know how to take it. - What will you do? We've built this Mill with our labour. We can ruin the Mill too. This Mill hasn't been built with your labour. Got it? It was built with our intelligence and brains. You can only make plans with your intelligence, not buildings. The machines we work on so hard.. Can be shut down too, sir. I hired you and I can fire you. You can fire us, but you can't save the Mill. Are you threatening? Get out. I say. Dhupia, call the police. Forget police, call the army. But if we don't get bonus within 24 hours.. I'll tell you after 24 hours. Come, brothers. We'll take our bonus. Or we'll demolish this Mill. We'll go on strike to fight injustice. Long live the revolution. Long live the revolution. Long live the revolution. Mr. Dhupia. - Mr. Dhupia. - Yes. Yes, Mr. Vikram. - Did you inform the police? - Yes. - Stop the police and announce the bonus. - Yes? Stop the police and announce the bonus. (Crowd Chattering) What is this, friend? We've decided this time in the Union elections.. We'll have you contest instead of Bipin Lal. Why are you tricking me into becoming a leader? I don't want to become a leader. - I'm a worker, let me be a worker. - Shut up. Don't say anything. This is our decision. Brothers, in the coming election.. Chander will contest against Bipin Lal on our side. - Chander, brother. - Long live. - Chander, brother. - Long live. Ladies and gentlemen. Brothers and sisters. In Hindi, women and men. Brothers and sisters. Listen to me carefully. (Music Playing) "He's a liar. Don't vote for him." "He's a liar. Don't vote for him." "Even if he gives you money, don't vote for him."

"My dear country-men." "Listen to me, brother." "He's not yours nor mine, but the boss's stooge." "He is his yes-man. He's only for the money." "He's only for the money." "He's not yours nor mine, but the boss's stooge." "He is his yes-man. He's only for the money." - "Oh, he's a big thief. - Yes." "When he gets the chance, he'll let you down." "Then do not tell us." "He's a liar. Don't vote for him." "Even if he gives you money, don't vote for him." "We work hard and he reaps the benefits." "Do not even take his name." - "He's a liar, Don't vote for him." - "Absolute liar." "Don't give him." - "He's a liar, Don't vote for him." - "He's a liar." "Don't vote for him." Chander Singh. Chander Singh. Chander Singh. Mr. Bipin, Chander Singh. That's it. Brother Chander won. (All Cheering) Dad. Out. What happened? I want to give you good news Dad. - So why not in front of him? - No. I don't like this man. Dad, I've avenged my insults. Bipin Lal Pandey is out of the Union. I know. In place of him your friend has come. What? You knew this? I'm not looking after such a big business just like that. But Vicky.. - There is nothing to be very happy about. - Why? Because your friend comes from a particular section of society. He's neither a beggar nor rich. He's from the middle class. That is very dangerous. - You can't trust them. - No, what are you saying? Most of the traitors and the loyal ones are.. From the middle class. On one side they've ambition to make it big. So, it's easy to make them traitors. And on the other side.. One thing always sticks to them like glue. And that is their conscience. Vicky, due to this they can become an enemy at any time. This is the last case. Maheshwar has to go. His father died. - How? - He was standing all day for rations. He suffered a heart attack and died. All right. Send him today. You wanted to see the place. Let's go. Come, brother Karim. What is the news? I want to invite you to my daughter's wedding. Congratulations, Uncle. Will you give us sweets? It's your sister's wedding. Everything's happening by God's grace and your favour. You've saved my family. God cut off my hand.. And so I got 5000 as compensation. Or my daughter would've remained unmarried. "It gets cut very easily, friend." "Try cutting your neck with this string." Friend. At such an old age you're flying a kite like a child. It's a passion as well as part of my work. Because I get food from what I earn. Not food, but drink. - Sir, you may go. I'm coming. - Okay. And passion? It's my passion because when the kite goes very high.. I feel happy to surpass those high up in the sky. Not God. I understand, friend. You mean people leaving in skyscrapers? Get some tea and biscuits. Brother Alam, I need some thread by evening. You'll get it. A very strong one. - How are you, brother Alam? - Come, sister Anandi. - I'm fine, how are you? - Fine. - And how is Shankar? - He's the same. Is the treatment going on? The treatment's going on. Very good, friend. What are you doing? You've just ordered for tea. Anandi works as a prostitute. We all know that. But what else will she do? Her husband's in bed since six months. She has two small children. How will she feed them? How will she treat her husband? Should she steal? If she begs, would she get more respect? Some sell talent, some loyalty, and some sell their conscience. I want to give you my belongings. You're taking care of these poor people. These are my poetries, my songs. I don't have any right to keep them here anymore. The one who had written these.. Was someone else, not me. I have lost life's battle and drowned in liquor. Take care of it. It has been two months since the elections got over. And you're still in the slum. You said you'd keep someone else and resign. What happened? I should find someone else. What about your friend, who wakes you up every morning. - Dhondu? - Yes. He's a fool. He can't even give a thumb impression. Brother, we need such men. It's difficult to detach an uneducated man from his society. - Only they join who want to fly. - Then what should we do? Vicky, I'm thinking about one man. Who? Bipin Lal. What? Here. First have a peg. You're looking upset. Vicky, how much is this Chivas Regal bottle for? Around Rs.200-250. Why? - And it makes 10-12 pegs. - Yes. - And one peg must be for Rs.20-25? - Right. It means this one glass is equal to a worker's.. Monthly ration for his family. Have you thought.. By drinking this we starve one family? What has happened to you? You're talking like the leader of the workers. I don't know, Vicky. Maybe I got their sadness. Drink up. All your sadness will go away. Cheers. Bottoms up. (Knock On Door) - Is Mr. Bipin Lal there? - Yes, your name. - Chander. - Chander! Come inside. Come. She's my daughter Rama. And.. Our Union's new leader. Seeing your face, I feel you haven't eaten since morning. Wait, I'll serve you food along with father. - I'm not hungry. - You'll eat before leaving. She's very stubborn, you'll have to eat. What is it? You're looking very worried. Mr. Bipin Lal, take the responsibility of the Union back. What do you mean? I can't see anymore. I'm afraid seeing this poverty. Are you seeing it for the first time? Mr. Bipin Lal, you come back to your post. I'm going back. Chander, you can't go back now. Why not? What do you know about me? Son, I only know.. The one who can't see grief and pain.. Can treat that grief and pain. His conscience won't let him turn his back.. On this grief and pain. Mr. Bipin Lal, can you tell me why poverty exists? Why are people in so much pain? There are many reasons. But the biggest reason is.. Some people want to buy everything of this country. This land, this earth, everything. All this can be ended? This is our struggle, Chander. When the people in politics start thinking.. Of the good of the public instead of power.. Or when the public know who their.. Real leaders are and drive out these fake leaders.. This dream will come true. I don't know when and how this revolution will come. People here are peace-loving. If they don't get to eat.. They quietly sit in front of the food shop and bear their hunger. Father, food is served. Rama, come here. Chander, if you want you can learn a lot from Rama. - About this. - What? Her husband was a big leader. He was killed during a strike. It was only the first year of their marriage. After that I took the responsibility of my Union. I thought if we've to die we must fight and die. Why should we die without a fight? And in this work Rama became my teacher. What are you saying? I'm very worried, sister. I can't see anyway. Brother Chander, do you love your people? Then you understand their pain and sorrow? That is enough. That love will guide you. - Chander. - Dhondu, you? - Yes, come fast. Alam's in a very bad state. - What happened? He vomited blood. He can't be saved. He's not even ready to go to the hospital. He's calling you. Hurry. Aunt, friend has not come yet? He'll come soon. Brother has gone to call him. When will he come? After my death? No, brother. Don't say that. (Crying) Don't say that. You'll recover. Friend, what happened friend? Now, I've no sorrow. Without you this party was incomplete. And how would a poet leave this party incomplete. Who will let you go? To the hospital? Dhondu, call an ambulance. No. Don't call for an ambulance. - Now, I'll go on your shoulder. - Quiet. For our friendship's sake. Today, you'll do as I tell you to do. At least on the last day let me do as I want. Friend, after I die distribute these kites to these children. - Alam. - One more thing. Sing that song, which you had composed. I'll surely sing it to you when you recover. Friend, for friendship's sake. "I'm a defamed poet." "I'm a defamed poet." "I'm leaving." "I'm leaving." "Defeated by the crowds." "I'm leaving." "I'm leaving." "I'm a defamed poet." "You'll get some goods from my house." "You'll find a book of the crazy poet." "You'll find one other thing." "A broken empty glass." "I'm leaving." "I'm leaving." "I'm a defamed poet." "I had to endure suffering. I had to bear pain." "I had to cry more on my destiny." "I've left behind many things incomplete." "I'm leaving." "I'm leaving." "I'm a defamed poet." "My life is blocking me from this journey." "I don't know what hopes are left in this broken heart." "Let me go, my heart." "My greetings to everyone." "I'm leaving." "I'm leaving." "I'm a defamed poet." Friend. Friend. Friend. The ambulance has come. Friend. (All Cheering) No, Vicky. I can't bear it anymore. I can't see anymore. So who is telling you to see? Your work is done, now leave it. How should I leave it? Their hunger and thirst have trapped me. I can't get out. I don't know what you're saying. Nowadays, I can't understand your language. If you could understand my state.. You'd understand what I'm saying. Vicky, do one work for me. - I'll be able to go with a clean conscience. - What? Increase their salary. Agree to their demand of inflation. Inflation? They get money as per inflation. Just for the namesake. This is all a show. They get some money on the basis of inflation. The next day the market rates goes up ten times. They get only dry bread to eat. When it dries up, they dip it in tea and eat it. For months, they don't eat pulses or vegetables. Potatoes which were Rs.0.50 a kilogram are.. Now for Rs.1.50. Cauliflower was.. Don't talk about the rates of vegetables. What is there to worry about? Tomorrow I'll approve their allowance. What allowance? Are the rates high due to me? I've increased the prices of grains. It's the Government's duty to control the prices. Ask allowance from the Government. But dad aren't these your own workers? If they eat only bread with tea.. How will they work? When did you see their bread and tea? Who told you the rates of grains and pulses? - Dad.. - All right. When you're worried, I'll have to think of something. Leave all this to me. What time is your flight? 11 o'clock. I'm just leaving. - On the way I've to pick up Mr. Dhupia. - Very good. Get the deal finalised soon. It's an ideal place. I've heard about the border fights. That's the reason. Son, it's about far-sightedness. Divide and rule. It's a very old lesson that the English gave us before leaving. To make the workers work, it's important.. To divide them. Never let them think that they're Indians of one sect. Rather say, you're a Madrasi, you're a Bengali.. You're a Punjabi, you're a Bihari. What are you saying? This is treachery. It's absolutely anti-national. Son, it's only about getting your work done. Since ages, we've been creating fights between Hindus and Muslims.. And breaking the unity of the workers. And we've been taking out our work. But what can we do. People have understood that ploy. Now there is a new game. Fights at the border. Tell the people.. That the others are encroaching on your land. That is enough. They'll keep fighting between themselves. They'll kill themselves. They think if they get that land, they'll be rich. We'll rule. They'll get the same bread and onions that they've been getting. Go and make the factory. Later, call Somu and you both take care of it. You'll learn it too. All right, Dad. - Jay Singh. - Yes. - Did you keep an eye on Vicky? - Yes. How did he come to know the prices of groceries? Chander, that new Union leader.. He keeps instigating junior boss. He keeps whispering to him. He incites him. Chander, the boss has come today. With his stooge. Somu. What are you doing here? - I.. - Have you fought and fled from home? Silly, you're the owner of this place. Is there any difference between you and Vikram? Are you both playing some pranks? I can't trust you two. Come with me. Foolish traitor. At least tell me what happened. We can't trust a person. But who? Tell me. What should I say? When a man like Chander betrays workers then.. No. This can never happen. This has happened. Chander turned out to be the boss' man. (Crow Sound) - Hit him! - Hit him! - No! - Hit him! What are you doing? Move away. Leave him. Move away. Move away. What have you done? - Have you gone crazy? - Let him die. He's a traitor. This is a lie. Is he not friend of this person's son? He came here to separate us. This is right that he came. But he is not like earlier. Just think about this. This is conspiracy. They always play like this. He is now became labor's friend. Why? Mr. Bipin Lal, this is true, I had come to break the unity of the workers. But thinking about their future... I know that. Someone can learn to say Ram instead of kill. Come let's take him in. Come. Sridhar! Sridhar! Sir, had you gone out? Yes. But I missed my flight. I'll go by the evening flight. Get the suitcase from the car. Sir. Sir. - Why have you come here? - It's very important news. - I don't want to hear anything. - It's about Somu. Leave right now. Broker! All right. Wait. - About whom did you come to tell me? - About Somu. - Who told you the name, Somu? - I came to tell you this. What? Tell me. Sir, a broker takes his fees. - Who told you this? - Your father. He exposed Somu in front of everyone at the Mill. And when he went to the colony, they beat him severely. - What are you saying? - I swear. I'm telling the truth. I've seen this with my own eyes. Vicky. Vicky. Who dared to hit Somu? Tell me. Who wants to fight? Come in front. Rascal, put your hands up. Come. I will teach you all a lesson. I will vanish everything. Somu, come with me. I won't let you stay here anymore. Vicky, sit here quietly. I've not come to sit, but to take you. Come on. It's very difficult for me to leave. Meaning? You won't understand. If you had stayed with these people for a few days.. With these people? I can see the result in the form of wounds on your body. These are the wounds of penance. Don't talk nonsense! Now get up. You're coming with me. I said I can't return to my previous life. Can I know why? Vicky. Many times you must have seen this while passing in your car.. Children eating from the trash. 'What is the state of this country?' You said it and turned away.. And went ahead in the car. And in a while you forgot everything. If some day you had got down from your car.. To see them closely.. You couldn't have sat in a car again. The same has happened with me. I got down from the car and went to see them closely.. And then I couldn't sit in the car again. This means.. These people are more important to you? No. After loving them I've learnt to love life. Enough. There's no need to say anything more. Tell me clearly, will you come with me or not? Can't you come to me? Here? I got my answer. Thank you. Thank you very much. You saw him going to the colony with your own eyes? Yes, sir. Junior boss did do the right thing. The people there are quite dangerous. Okay, you can go. - What is it? - My wife is very sick. Where do I keep this? On this table. Thank you. There is a small request. Junior boss shouldn't know whatever I've told you. Or he'll murder me. - All right. Go. - Thank you. (Door Open) - May I know why you exposed Somu like this? - See. Vicky, see this ship. A friend has sent it from Indonesia. It's made of clove. - I've come to ask about Somu. - It's such intricate work. Look. The ship, the people and everything of clove. Didn't you go today? Why did you expose Somu and got him beaten up? This isn't the answer to my question. - Meaning? - The meaning is clear. I asked you if you were supposed to leave by today's flight. The answer is clear. Seeing me you know I've not gone. Why! What for? I've answered your first question. Now you answer my question. What was the reason behind Somu getting beaten like this? I regret this. I had hoped the workers will kill Somu. - If anyone raise their hands on Somu.. - This is my bedroom. If you want to scream, go to those workers. Yes. I'd forgotten. There is no place for you even there. You had to come running from there like a dog. So much feeling in your heart for a traitor! May I know why? - He's a traitor. - Father, this is my personal matter. It happened between the two of us.. And if a third person.. But I want to say one thing. If anyone raises his hand on Somu now.. Then I will.. Vicky. I forgot to give you the good news. Doctor has given me the permission to go to office. From tomorrow you'll not have to go to office. Hello. Dhupia. Give a notice to Somu, alias Chander, tomorrow morning. Strike. We've to reply.. To the injustice done to Chander. - And the answer is strike. - Yes. If anyone is against this decision, raise your hand. Friends. I feel before going on a strike.. We must think of the consequences. Rates are going up. The rates are becoming double and triple. And this strike could go on for months without compromise. Chander, we've seen years of hunger, not just months. We can still do that. We don't get proper food or shelter. We're miserable. We won't fear death. - Yes, we're not scared of death. - We want a strike! We want a strike! So the factory will be closed from tomorrow. Sir, Mr. Somu has come. What work does he have here? Sir, what should I tell him? Send him in. - Traitor. - Yes, Vicky. You had fed me. That is why I'm a traitor for you. But for the Almighty God.. - I'm not a traitor. - Enough. Lecture away in that colony. You'll be praised there. How are you? Fine. Won't you ask how I am? What is the need? You must be fine. You have many friends. You're the leader of thousands. When you talk, people think you're God. What else do you want? My God. Are you still angry? Look. I've got a remedy for your anger. What is this? See for yourself. Has mother come? She has sent sweets for you. And only a letter for me. Sarla has written it. She has written.. To not eat even one without asking brother Vicky. So mother does not know about this yet? No, not yet. - But when she comes here.. - Somu! Whatever happened between us has happened. But don't tell mother about this, I'll deal severely with you. You're the best, friend. Shut up. Don't call me a friend. You're still the same. Innocent. And me? I've grown up suddenly in a few days. I've passed the age.. To get angry with my friend over petty things. Vicky, just think. Think calmly. Am I your enemy? There is no fight between us. The fight is between the two classes. Were these classes there when we were friends? And even now when.. What? When we've become enemies? Yes. Shall I leave? All right, bye. - Hello. - Hello. Are you Mr. Somu? Vicky's friend? Vicky is my friend, but nowadays we're not on talking terms. Thank God you came. He's very lonely. Will you please shut up and get out? In your screaming I could hear sobbing, Vicky. Don't mock my weakness. Weakness? This is the best part about you. Even now, like your friend.. You can love other more than yourself. The only difference is, Somu's love is taking him forward.. But you're stuck in sadness. Nisha, don't recite your poetry to me. I felt like talking to him for sometime. Why? Could you hear poetry in his talks? Or your socialism? No. We all just breathe. He was alive. - Out of this sin.. - Sin? What sin? Vicky, in today's society no one can.. Be honest and become a millionaire. If we assume that it's possible.. Then with poverty all around.. It's a sin to horde money. In spite of knowing this, we're afraid to lose everything.. So we side with this sin. But Mr. Somu, in the hope of getting everything.. Left this sin and is trying to live like a human being. There was only one way of staying in your class with you. In your cheap words you call it, "as being your stooge." Would you like this? It's good that he learnt to live without you. Yes, it's good. It's good that he learnt first. It would've been better if I had learnt before him. Nisha. Here I feel you very near to me. Because only you understand my friend. You were saying this strike would end in seven days. In three days these people will go weak. But what happened? Today it's nearly a month. People are dying of hunger, of illnesses. But what to do? They won't concede. Have you seen today's headlines? God willing, this war can't be avoided. War is inevitable. And war means money, earning. How many such opportunities come in life? And this isn't a world war which will go on for years. It's a question of a week, ten days or a month. - Should we lose that? - This is right, but what to do? Call them and compromise. As of now, agree to all the demands. We'll see after the war. And listen, as soon as the strike ends.. Get rid of both Somu and Bipin Lal. If we get rid of them, there will be a strike again. What has happened to your intelligence, Dhupia? Don't you read the newspaper? So many things happen in the world. Many accidents take place. Someone comes under a lorry or a car. Go and do your work. It's the 33rd day of the strike. We've made with our strength for three days to thirty days. This is the time to take care and to be careful. But remember. If we lose our grip now.. We'll get nothing. Friends, no worker wants to go on strike. No worker has food for a month in his house. But we still have to go on strike. And with the strike we show the bosses.. - We aren't as weak as they think we are. - Yes. Junior boss. It's a disaster! - Who told you? - Do not ask me. Save your friend's life. He's a very nice man. First tell me, who wants to kill him? - I won't tell you. - Who is that? You're unnecessarily wasting time. Dad? Sir told you? Why are you after the name? Do you want the name or your friend's life? - Here. - No. This time I've not come as a broker. For the first time in my life I'm talking honestly. I do not want money. - What are you doing here? - It's over. - What? - Waiting. - I was waiting here. - Why? The strike is in the Mill. There is no ban on our meeting. Do you know you've not spoken properly to me in a month? You know how much work is there during a strike? In the Mill you've to work one shift. In the strike, it's three. We've to think and take care of everyone. Yes, except Shama. Don't you have to care for yourself? What if something happens to you? You know there is a danger to life in a strike? Who cares about life? If one Somu dies, ten will take birth. What if something happens to my Chander? There won't be anyone for me. You're a worker's girl, yet you talk like cowards. Are we only fighting for our own happiness? Isn't everyone's happiness our happiness? Make good food for me. Good? How can I make good food in this strike? Whatever you make will be good. Now go. I'll just come. Go. Has anyone seen Chander? This telegram has come since morning. His mother and sister are coming today. I saw Chander going there. - There? - Yes. The train must've arrived. Somu! (Crowd Chattering) Mother, you'll have to go on foot from here. It's nearby. Child, come here. Take this luggage. - Has someone gone to call Bipin Lal? - Yes. - Call the ambulance. - Okay. Somu! Somu! Look here, Somu. Somu. Somu. I am Vicky. Yes. - Vicky. - Yes Somu. I just came Somu. You told me that why I could not come to you. I reached Somu. - Vicky. - Yes Somu. Did you come Vicky? Yes. - Vicky. - Yes Somu. Take care of them. Now is your responsibility. Yes, I take the responsibility. I take the responsibility. I swear, Somu. I swear, Somu. Somu. Somu. Somu. What happened? No! (Crying) Listen, son. Where does Somu stay? You? I am his mother. Why? What happened? Where did Somu stay? Brother! Brother! Brother! Brother! - Tell me! - Tell me who sent you. Tell us. I'll tell you. He gave me money. He gave me money. - Who sent you? - I sent him. Yes. I'm responsible for this murder. He was a traitor. He was a traitor. Your Honour, I got him here to help me. But instead of helping me, he became my enemy. And I.. Greetings, Mr. Bipin Lal. Fourteen years, Vicky? Fourteen years... I've not called you here to cry, Nisha. I want to give you a responsibility. Take care of mother and Sarla. Mr. Bipin Lal, you came here. Thanks a lot. If I tell you why I've called you here.. You might laugh. No, son. Tell me. I promised to Somu while he was dying.. To continue his fight. That fight should continue. Yes. Even if you hadn't said yes, I would've continued it. Good. How's your daddy, Nisha? The day you gave yourself to the police.. He suffered his third heart attack. He was between life and death for a few days. Till yesterday we hadn't told him anything. But today he knows everything. After knowing that, he's in such a bad state that.. I feel the day he got the attack.. He should've.. Vicky, he has come to meet you today. Why did you let him come here? Vicky, meet him once. He won't live for long. Yes, son. Meet him. Hello, Dad. Why did you do this? To save me? No, Dad. I know you would've easily saved yourself.. With your money and influence. I didn't want that. When I was three years old, mother died. You brought me up. But you couldn't give me love. Because you were more busy in making money. This is the family where I got a friend like a brother. I got a sister, a mother and love. You didn't only take my friend from me.. But a son from a mother.. And a brother from a sister. So I want you to suffer till you're alive. You should get double my punishment. Does the son have the right to pay for his father's sins? Go. Go home. Please. Please. Leave me alone. Dad. Take care of yourself. - Uncle! - Sir. Son. (Crying)
