Looks like a storm's coming. There are a lot of clothes on the roof. What will you do then? Ask her to write you all the property? Hey Lalita, go. Wait, I'll go at the break. Ma! The sky has been pricked! All the clothes will get drenched! Yay! Yippey!- -All of them are drenched! Hey Pokai! Run in at once! Now you will catch a cold. -Madam, This shit isn't Sir's shirt. What are you saying! And this one? That's not mine. Must be Ruby's. Go give it back. Hey, where is my green blouse? Green blouse? Let me check. Now come on turn around. Why are you being so naughty ? -Madam! Look at this! Isn't it pretty? Isn't it? -Go ask Halum's mother. Must be hers. Halum's mother ? Does she wear all this? This is exactly like what... ...cinema artists wear! You'll look quite pretty in it too. Please! Ever seen me wear such things? Go give it back. How boring! -Hey, look for my blouse. Sure! What if Halum's dad goes to work wearing it ? That'll be fun! -I'll give you one tight slap! What are you staring at? Go study. The Earth is round. The Earth has a Sun and a Moon. Ma, am I your Sun? Then who is your Moon? You and your stupid questions! -God! What's this? Couldn't you have taken an umbrella? Here, your green blouse. And this is not theirs. Neither Ruby's. In which case I think I could... I'll keep this. Let someone come asking. Read. -What if noone comes looking? Then I'll take care of it. Oh. You can wear it till then. Can I dare to? Until that hag goes up for good ! Listen, I am going up. Ma, now you can wear it. Pokai! Read! Ma, what I was saying is... Pokai has a lot of homework. I've to sit with him. If you could kindly finish the prayers today. Really? As if you finish the prayers everyday. Disgusting! Anyway. -Ma... Why doesn't Granny allow you to wear nighties? Always trying to be over smart!

My wife left me in monsoon Its raining all over my home My wife has left my home Yes, the buffalo's hit me again! What will your husband think? Nothing. He'll find another woman in a few days. What will your parents think?- -Nothing. They'll shed a few tears and then forget about it. And... What do you think? Me? I think... ...I think I want to marry you as soon as possible! Soon! Soon! Stop this! -Hey, stop playing. Switch on the lights. Mr. Manik... ...wants to say something. Yes. I've spent seventy years of my life on the stage. So how old are you? -Seventy-two. What a shame! This is where Bengali cinema stands? And we've to accept it? A beautiful newly wed bride, elopes with a fisherman! Leaving her much respected brand new husband! Even Manik has made films in the same language. Who? Mr. Manik. You mean Satyajit Ray. -Yes. He too has made films in this language. But this a love story. Though, involving fishermen in this was not correct. After all for generations they've been... ...guiding our women into the sea . This is a love story? Is this love? This is desire. What! Immoral! But Ray has shown immoral love in the film 'Charulata'. Yes he did. But in the end Bhupati had punished Charulata. Is it so? -Yes! He sent her to Kashi. -Kashi! Kashi? -Varanasi? Did he have her head shaved? -In which version? The one that released abroad. The real version. Abroad? Hello. What! Fire? -Where? At the market! The Fire brigade hasn't come? But the media has? I'll be right there. Becoming the fire brigade minister has ruined me. Some bloody monkey is burning down the city, I've to go running after it. Yes. Then let's wrap it up for tonight. Let's sit tomorrow? Okay? Let's go, Mr.Manik. Huh? We are both gaping. Why's there so much light here? Is this a shopping mall? - This is heaven, Madam. American heaven. The land of give and take! Now give! Hope you're enjoying madam! Why not? This is heaven! And your husband? I want beep ! I want beep ! I want Madam! Your nighty is one crazy thing! It's magical! -And me ? You? Chapter 1: Dutta Villa Massacre Hardev... ...oh Hardev... Hope you haven't mixed water in the milk. What are you saying Madam! But you see its summer. The cows drink quite a lot of water these days. Is that so? And what about you? Come in and collect your payment. But its not month end yet, Madam. The more the delay... ...the lower the value . Got it? Got it! Got it! If only I had a cow like you in my stable... ..I would never give her a chance to complain. What have I done God! I have committed such a huge sin! My mother-in-law asked me to not wear nighties. I would frown at her. Today I understand, my Lord... That nighties heat you up ! From today I'll offer you duck eggs and milk as a sacrifice. Forgive me! Please forgive me! Madam! Take it if you want it. But don't go walking in the locality wearing it. Where is my tea? Tea? Coming. Sir... Where the hell is my... ...tea! Sir! Your tea! Oh God! Thank you oh God! Oh God! Thank you God! Please do bless this house. What are you doing there? Who is here then? Who are you? What are you doing here ? What are you doing here?

Yes, sing it properly. Let it swing in your hands... Sir. Master! What is this ? Now come on! Swing my heart! Oh master! I Heard you slipped and fell ... ...into the mud... -Huh! Tell me, where are you hurt? Why bother, auntie?- -Of course I need to! Because every bitch has her day you see. Everyone will see! -Oh please. What is this? Open the door! Who locked me in? Granny! Ma! Master, do not stop bellowing! Do not stop bellowing! -Auntie!!! Forgive me Lord! That nighty had driven me crazy! I will make you both new gold crowns. Golden crowns! Please forgive me! Give me if you have anymore. -No more clothes. Now go! A bowl for my dearest Lord. Good riddens! Such blossoming life, I welcome you! Oh such bloom in this life, I welcome you! To this happy gay time of spring! Chapter 2: Bonu and Bhanu This blossoming garden of love! To this happy gay time of spring! This blossoming garden of love! How beautifully you sang that song! Ma'm, are you going to Bangkok tomorrow? Yes! Why won't I? It's the first ever Bengali Festival in Bangkok. Here. Thank you. Thank you... hey! What are you doing? Come and help me! Lazy bumb! See you then. Bye! Bhanu dear, tell me, who sings your classically based songs the best? You. You. You. Take your medication. Bimal, why don't you write a book... ...about me and Rabindranath Tagore? Bonu... ...and Bhanu. What happened to you! -A cockroach! Why are you jumping? Get that cockroach out of here! -What is wrong! Oh my God! -What? Oh no! -What is it? How could I do this? I hugged you in front of him! Oh no! God knows what he thinks of me! What will he think? I am your husband, after all. Though, ...it's difficult to figure that out. You don't even use my surname. What should I write? Bonolakshmi Hore? -Yes. I feel embarrassed. -Why? The English meaning isn't too flattering. People ask for my rate. Never thought of it before marriage? But tell me, how is it that your name is Bonolakshmi Tagore? Your father's name is Nilmani Guchait. Your husband's name is Bimal Hore. How does that make you Bonolakshmi Tagore? In my heart I am married to him. Long before you came into my life. I was only six then. Then why marry me at all? You've never even let me touch you. Even our bedrooms are separate. I am a human being too. The one who is everything for me, is a global being. Stop this! Oh God! Now what? Any problem? -What is all this? See, Mr. Manik, this is about a huband-wife relationship. This relationship is drowning due this degrading society. That is something only a sociologist can understand. See, when a relationship... -Titanic! Did you say something? -I was saying... err... Titanic! Never seen a better film on drowning relationships ? Think about it. A relation. As in a relation-ship... Fell right into the sea. -That film, Titanic? Right! The amount of water they wasted, All of Bengal's fire can be extinguished with it. But joking around with Tagore's character? No! See, Mr.Manik, that is the perception of that woman. Not Rabindranath Tagore's. -How, but? Tagore's photograph says, 'You, you. You.' Oh Mr. Manik, Mr.Manik. Mr.Manik! I am a psychologist, right? You may call this some sort of a hallucination. You can call it Extra- Tagore syndrome. What! Extra-Tagore syndrome. The problem the woman is suffering from. Like the way it happened in the film, 'Taare Zameen Par'? Exactly! -But making fun of legends? This needs to be beeped. -Hey Kalu, rewind. Okay fine, I'll give the beeps. -Fine, let's watch it. Tell me, who is it that sings... your classically based songs the best? You. -Beep. You. -Beep. You. -Beep. Looks like he is swearing! This needs to be chopped off. Hello, Jhumi. -Yes, Ma! Reached? -Yes! On our way to the hotel. -Asked about his salary? No. Haven't spoken yet. And Ma, is this the time to ask such questions? Oh God! Why don't you get it. Once you're into the room... What will you do if I don't ask him? Besides we were in the same room on the wedding night too. Nothing happened. Me and your aunt hid under the bed all night. Bye! Any problem?

The Queen on the horse, wearing a gleaming white nighty! The Queen of England standing in broad daylight in a nighty? It was night in England then.- -Oh. This is the discipline of the English! Bengalis got the nighty but not the discipline. Forget it, its a farce. I don't care if its true. I have told my wife, no nighty.- -Its all fake. Impossible. People are going crazy about this nighty!

The nasty strategy the males have... ...taken up to satisfy their lust for women... ...this planned conspiracy... ...those who are playing a dirty game with the reputation of women... ...they must be given strict punishment! The last dart of the Kali era... ... and now... ...comes the Satya era. This is a film on relationships?- -No... err... A film about a nighty; couldn't find another suject! Whereas Uthpal Dutt has written dramas about the Barber revolt. Mrinal Sen has made films on Naxalites. Sankha Ghosh has written poetry on the Hungry Revolution. "Oh Godmother, light our dark kitchens with a little fire." Fire?!- -There he goes. Where is the fire? Has the media reached? Rice for food and nighty for clothes, that's a Bengali. That was very accurate.- -What? Their food is rice and garb is a nighty, what else makes a Bengali so mighty? How's that? It was going well with the relationship problems, why all this in a Bengali film? Extra-maritals really suit the Bengali language. Its basically a study on the effect of nighty... ...on human psyche. Really? But where the hell did the nighty go? Power failure! Kalu, arrange for a candle! Mr. Parimal, what are you doing! What's the progress? The ministry is threatening me. We've put up check posts on every crossroad. I've given orders to take in any woman in a nighty. Brilliant! Women will come out on the road wearing nighties. Right Sir. My point too, Sir. So we're procuring all nighties from markets, ladies hostels, even the red light area to check. Keep up the work.- -Matter of our women's prestige. We will have to find it out.

Then where did the real nighty disappear? Police! Save me please! I'm her husband. This is the cursed nighty! This is it? Where did you find it? Bought it from a roadside shop. Had no idea then! Its not your mistake honey.- -Neither mine. When I hugged her never felt like his wife. Felt like some other woman. You rascal! She is the one who calls me everyday. Its the nighty, not me!- -Is that so? Has the cursed nighty been finally found then? What should be done with it now? This one's not real. She is just making an excuse. You should not have written that article. This nighty is the main culprit. But... Where's the real one? I know, your dreams too are lost like that nighty. The entire city is dreaming of it now. But I want the nighty, Apu. I'll be back. I'd cook something if you could get some grocery. Where the lips read the heart, Where the eyes are the raincoats No one will ever know How love hurts. What are you thinking? What if we had never met? Why? I'd become a lamp post and hide on the streets. Or may be you'd sleep on the roads as the tram line? You men don't understand anything but sleeping around? We do. But we can't explain it to others. Ane so... ...we bear the brunt of it all our life. Lost in love, marriage or exam? Contact fast!

She can sleep with anyone wearing that nighty. But I know, she is not that kind of a girl. Her soul is not like that, her soul is pure. One minute. The cursed nighty?- -Yes. You've seen it?- -Yes. And I mistook it for love. In your dreams? Yes. Wearing that nighty, she... ...kissed me in my dream. Tea? What is all this! See... ...is this the same cursed nighty? Is this the real one? So many fake ones in the market right now. So...- Want to check? What are you doing? No! Please let me go! Once I have been tricked by this nighty. Not again. That was a dream. This is real. Holy crap!- -Why are you thinking of her? How did you know? Why else am I a witch? Where did you get this? Hey... Someone is trapped inside this. She does not love me. All she wants is this nighty. So she can become a heroine.- -And what do you want? I want to know the truth. Come! Come! Come! Come! Not everyone finds Love in this life Love in this life Not everyone finds Love in this life Lucky are those who find that heaven of dreams Let's leave now.- -Yes, I've to go too. Not everyone finds Love in this life She is quite a hot thing. I don't want to her a word about her. Not one word! So.. what do you think is wrong with Raja? Seems like he has found his queen. Get lost. Whether or not the lips meet Whether or not there's a lover's embrace Whether or not the lips meet Whether or not there's a lover's embrace Two hearts can stay alive Just through the conversation of the eyes By the loved conversation of eyes Monica...

Really! I can't believe this! Broad daylight. For you. It'll be night as soon as you wear it. You know what this is called? Why? A maxy. That's just the colloquial name. Its scientific name is 'Maxy Monica Kasturica'. Is that so? Nice. Quite interesting! Why else would I get for you? Because my name is Monica? What else?- -But who is Kasturi? No one. What is wrong? You will marry me, right? I'm going abroad for two years. To study. Won't you wait for me? I'm illiterate. You're from such a rich family. Will you remember me? If I forget... ...this Maxy Monica Kasturica will be the symbol of our love. I'll remember everything once I see this. Everything seems so much like... ...the movies! This is not a movie, Monica... ...this is all real. Where had you been the last 2 days? Everyone got worried.- -Had gone for a pilgrimage bro. Maxy Monica Kasturica! Kasturi is your wife. Didn't get the rest.- -There's no point doing that. You must go now. Your wedding night is nearly over! Kasturi... Hey Kasturi... What happened? What is wrong with you? I'd thrown it. Where did it go!? What?- -Nothing, a bad dream. Go to sleep. Want water?- -Go sleep! Hello... Hello. Raja...- -Monica! Maxy Monica... Kasturica... Trying to scare me? Are you getting scared? Who said so... ...that I'm getting scared? I know... ...who Kasturi is. So? Tomorrow morning a news will reach your home. Hello! Monica! Bitch! Blackmailing me! I... ...wanted to be killed by you, Raja. I will have leave now. I have a lot of work to do. I have to look for... ...a true love. Hence, you see Mr. Choudhury, we have to do the inquiry. He is Raja. My son. He was saying something about you. What was her name... Monica. Not a good girl. Nothing to be scared of. Did you know her? No. Why are you getting scared? She committed suicide 2 days ago drowning herself. She has written the name of some guy called Raja in her note. Please come and see if you know her. Impossible! I myself...- Raja... ...what is the matter with you? Please take him with yourself. Check if you know her. No.- -You don't? That's it then. You're done. The one who has pained me... ...he will never be at peace. He will have to come back again and again. And he will get cheated. Just like he cheated me. This is his punishment. Now do you understand what this soul wants? Why it is unsettling the entire city? It is looking for love. And what about that guy? Did he take birth again?- -He is connected to a black telephone. I am not very... ...bothered about... ...what Monica wants. But I know, what Apsara wants. Yes, I know. I know that... ...if she does not get it... ...if she... Meow! Came to say sorry. Where had you been all these days, baby? This nighty won't stay will Apsara. But she will die without it.- -It will go to a fairy. Ring-a ring-a roses, pocket full of poses. Hush-a, Whoosh-a, we all... ...fall... ...down! What happened? Meow! Baby is not in the mood! Your love is in danger, Apu! Apu! I will have to save her. Damn you! Hey Apsara, stop! Apsara! Help! Apsara... Oh my my! Who is this new bee? Pussy cat pussy cat! So many black wools? Meow. Pussy cat, Pussy cat, you better run. Another few minutes and, your life is gone! Who said that?- -Who was that? Who the hell said that? He lip synced. And I am the one who said it. Who is that? Dev! Guest appearance. Dev! Hey! Hey you! Stop! Come on, Apsara. Let's leave. let's get out of here! You'll kill me? Smoking kills. So friends... all good? I came to this city to act in a film with Dev. My dream came true today. I did become Dev's heroine, even if for a little while. Now I want to come back, Apu. Apsara...- -Call me by my real name from today. Brishti. Come, drench me in your love. One minute. I don't need to wear this anymore. You really don't need to wear this anymore? No. That means you can love me even if you're not wearing this? I've understood one thing, Apu. If one has true love in one's heart... ....this nighty does not work on that person. This nighty has military rule on the city. Come, let's love. Let the clouds engulf us, With the rains pitter patter, As the drops caress your skin, And let your thoughts run free, Let the clouds engulf us, I have drawn the curtains on the Sun, Just for you, And all that remains are these words. The End. He is this film's producer and director. All yours.- -Namaskar. Aren't you ashamed?- -Extremely Sir, I can't ...look myself in the eye, trust me. Then why make such a film?- -err... but Sir... ..there is a strong message at the end of the film. That there is.- -Sir, this is a love story... ...teaches people to love. Or the world would come to an end. Right? Why don't you do something, when the strong message scene comes... everyone in the audience will also recieve a message on their phones. This is the message! This is the message! I'll think about it, Madam. But this film won't work, no emotions. Sir, I've invested a lot, please let this one go. Mr. Manik, let it be. Yes, let it go. Anyway with that name no decent people will come watch it. And the decent ones rule the society, so it won't effect the society. Isn't it? Mr. Manik, let it go, with cuts and beeps? With cuts and beeps.- -So, it will be 'Adult' rated? Adult? What are you saying? Double Adult!- -Make it senior citizen. What nonsense! Such bullcrap! Such crap in the name of films! What a pain! Such crappy films! Nonsense! Oh no! Who are you? This nighty will go to an fairy. Chapter eight: The End. Monica's soul rests in peace now. But what about Raja? He too must be hanging around somewhere. Looking for his love... ...beyond births. Losing it everytime, again and again. But why is he losing it? Because he's failing to trust love everytime. The Cursed Pyjamas. Coming soon.
