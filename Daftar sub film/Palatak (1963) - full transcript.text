I'll pay you your fees, I won't cheat. Where have you boarded? - Here only. I'm not saying that. I mean where will you sleep tonight? Why? There's the cot, I'll sleep comfortably.

Uncle, he came as mice and wants to become a tiger! So why are you concerned, dear!? This is doctor's place. If he invites me to stay here.. ..why are you having pain in stomach!? Fine, I'll allow you to stay. But you'll get late to sleep. Why.. why? - The drama season is approaching. The rehearsals would go on till one thirty at night. After that you may.. - I'll leave!

Ho yes, is there a cot.. a cot!? - Yes.. yes there is. Say that. If you want to feed me then cook it well. Otherwise you'll take me upstairs and ask to lie on floor. That's not done! Come on.. come on.. come on.. come on. Don't delay, come on! - Come. What diet you said, doctor, lentils and chapatti, right? Yes. - Send it quickly. I'm going, understand? What!? - Look at him, asking what! Do I have grains or a stove!? Where could I get them, tell me!? Come on, man! But yes, don't send any cheap lentils.

Money!? - Dear, original thing! Get out! - What!? Get out I say get out! - Why.. why? What, why!? Did I give you place for money!? You're showing me money power! Son of a Brahmin, was roaming on roadside! I invited you and gave you place to stay! And you're.. you're showing money to me! Brother! - This brother.. brother won't do! The door is open, get lost right now! I care a damn to get lost! Brother, let me greet your feet! - What are you doing! Oh my goodness! A man gets angry on hearing.. ..about money in this materialistic age! You aren't human, brother! So then, all hail Mother goddess! Hey what are you doing! Why opening the bandage!? You're right, brother, it's very bad sore! Flies would swarm over it wherever I go! Look, brother! Look here. Sore my foot! Two paisa for bandage, two paisa for colour. Otherwise by now, I'd have been. Doctor! Doctor! Hey doctor, do you have any brain!? - Why!? What, why!? Last night you sent a bowl of lentils. Who the hell cooked it, may I know!? - Hori cooked it. Why? What's wrong? - Hori? Oh, I see. I'll see to him! Hori! Hori! Hay you Hori! Hey.. hey.. hey Hori means my.. Isn't there any limit of poignancy!? Look what happened to my tongue! Where did he go! Hori! Hey you Hori! Has he gone deaf! Hey you Hori! My name is not Hori, it's Horimoti! Why screaming like a bull early morning!? Child, the lentil last night was very poignant. He was say.. No it wasn't. - It wasn't!? Certainly not. - Then how did my tongue got burnt? Look, doctor look. What's the fault of the tongue, how poignant your words are! Those come out of that tongue only, how much could it bear? What did you say!? What's this, she went away!? - Let her go! She's just a kid. And moreover you aren't going to eat.. ..food cooked by her everyday. Make your own arrangement from today. That's it, everything will get fine. Look at him, what is he saying! Why should I care for myself!? When you all are here then what should I bother for!? Come on, man I'm a wanderer Brahmin boy. Could I manage cooking and all!? I won't eat for free. I won't eat for free, doctor. I won't eat for free.. here, hold this. - What? Won't you need to do marketing!? I know what you'll feed me otherwise. - Look! Don't be angry. Don't be angry, doctor! I'm in a habit to talk rude. But you're an experienced man. How could you get angry on such things? Now your daughter, that Hori or Hore whatever you said. She said so much to me this early morning, did I get angry? Did I!? Come on, man, a little girl, what she said.. Look, don't call me little! I can hear everything form there! Doctor, I'm leaving. What about afternoon meal? I told you to do whatever you can. I won't be able to cook for outsider ghosts, father! 'All right I'll come back and cook myself, tell her, doctor!' Very fine, let it be so! Does one put so much salt? - Huh! Oh my! Even a cow won't be able to eat that! - Let it be! No need of expert advice! Hey.. hey.. hey.. hey! What does this mean? What does this mean!? Otherwise no one could be able to eat. It would have got burnt. That's my problem! Why are you concerned!? Poured water just like that! What caste are you!? Brahmin. - Huh, Brahmin! All are Brahmins like that! Let me see what kind of Brahmin you are! Can you to recite the Gayatri Mantra!? Is caste a gum, that will keep sticking all the time!? Didn't you remember while eating lentils last night? My God! Oh my, could I do all this! It's better you cook. Why standing here, go!? You're new here, eat, be merry, rest a couple of days. And then I'll get attachment. I'm not going to do that! I'll be gone by tomorrow morning. - Huh! What do you mean by Huh? Who is letting you go!? - Wait.. wait. Repeat what you said! - I said, who is letting you go!? This is not good sign! Actually when I met you last night. What to tell you.. what to say.. I've got a strange attachment with you. - That won't work. What!? - Yes. A Brahmin boy, not bad looking.. ..moreover Ankti Chatterjee's brother. Why not talk sweetly and dump your burden on me!? Oh Lord.. Lord, you're a limit man! I do.. I do. I do understand everything! I was thinking something else! - What.. what? You keep roaming for no reason. - Yes. Rather stay back here. - Okay. Eat, be merry, you'll get some pocket money as well. Well.. well. - Join our group. What? - Your singing skill is also not bad! Drama!? - Else what!? Look, doctor, you grind rice and make cookies. You're worth that only. Don't try to interfere into our family matters! I'm Boshonto Chatterjee, Ankti Chatterjee's brother! I'll join your drama party.. No, man I'll get away today itself! What!? - My.. my, could I stay more! Who knows what you'll get me involved in! So, doctor I'll leave. - What could I do? Can't hold you back forcefully. Have you decided where to go? Let me see, I'll cross the Ganges and go somewhere. Oh yes, doctor do you have change? - Change? Give me! I gave you the money in the morning.. ..didn't you save anything from that!? Give me from that. The boatman is not my brother-in-law.. ..that he'll row me across for free. The times are as such that even the family.. ..doesn't talk properly without money! Take this! Take and get lost! We aren't thief or fraud! We don't take money for feeding guests! Hey doctor, what is she saying? What to do? Poor man's family, so.. otherwise.. No, man better you take it. Look at you, what are you saying! Hey I'm Ankti Chatterjee's brother! I give so much money to so many people! So consider I gave to you as well! Consider I gave it for sweets, don't refuse, doctor. Okay? So I'll leave now. Bye, hot chilly! Brother Yudhstir! Brother Yudhstir! Brother Yudhstir! My goodness, now I'm at peace! Hey, you aren't gone yet!? - How could I go!? That fellow Harish, the violinist of drama party! Not a human, you understand he's not a human. - Why? He brought tears to my eyes! I'm a sinful man, have nothing called a heart! What to tell you, he got my heart, absolutely rotten! I'm no less as well! I bought it instantly, for seven rupees! Seven rupees!? - Good deal, right? I gave him a ten rupee note, so he should.. ..have returned me three rupees, right? But how could he, his pocket is empty!? So I got a deal, he'll teach me three tunes for three rupees! What do you say? Oh damn, I'm wasting time here with you.. Hey where are you going!? I've to search for a vacate place, understand? Without a vacate place, it won't suit nicely! But without eating.. - Oh leave eating and all! Look at him! What is this? What does this mean!? Doctor! Doctor! Doctor! Doctor! Doctor! Doctor! Father is not at home. There you are, notorious girl! You poured water on me! How could I know it's you? I thought it's a fox. - What!? When a fox goes mad, it makes such sound. Okay, you're laughing! Fine, it's over! Hey when did you come? - I won't even drink water from this house! Hey wait! - I'll see to you! - Wait.. wait! If I'm Boshonto Chatterjee, if I'm Ankti Chatterjee's brother.. '..if I'm..' - What's the matter? 'If I'm a real Brahmin boy, I'd never come to this house!' The man came back I suppose? - Yes! Damn.. damn! Whatever happened is over, man. Now come to eat. Yes, come to eat. Boshonto, it was a mistake. - Yes a mistake. I'm apologising! Come to eat. - Come to eat. Boshonto! Boshonto! Boshonto! Huh, who cares if he doesn't come!
