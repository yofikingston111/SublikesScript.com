I am his sweetheart My beloved's charming street Pot breaker, please come forward. Who called me? I'm here. What if my pot had broken? I'd have gotten a brass pot for you. Yes. The brass pot would have put me... in junior Chaudhary's debt. Razia. It's not right to call your childhood friend Aslam as junior Chaudhary. That was childhood immaturity. But now, we're grown up. That's why I know that you live in a mansion. And I live in a mud house. Razia, in childhood we would build sand houses and exchange them. So why can't you consider my mansion as your house? Aslam, your talk might make me proud. If beauty is not proud, even love doesn't bow before it. Razia, for the last time, I'm separating from you... and going to the city to finish my education. - What are you saying? - Don't worry, Razia. Once I return we'll never separate again. - Hello, junior Chaudhary. - Hello. May God grant integrity! Today I discovered that junior Chaudhary has grown up. Insolent! If you behave insolently with me... I'll have you banished from the village. May God grant integrity! We barbers are so respected that prominent landlords... bow their heads in front of us for hours. - Kalu, stop your nonsense. - May God grant integrity! You? Razia, congratulations. What's the good news for which you're congratulating me? - Razia, Aslam... - Quiet. Shameless. Seems like you overheard everything. And I saw it too. Your thirst was quenched. So you returned from the well with an empty pot. Oh yes! It's empty. Out of fear of your brother. Kalu, where did you sell your instruments? Look. It's growing in God's devotion. It's better you let it grow. You'll receive blessings! May God grant integrity! Kalu, you seem upset today. What's the matter? What's the matter? Why? - Don't barbers have any honor? - Why not? - I'll go and tell Mr. Chaudhary. - What happened? I'm not a gossipmonger. Don't tell anyone. Junior Chaudhary loves Razia. May God grant integrity! - Is that so? - That's what I'm going to tell him. You stopped me needlessly. Hello, Mr. Chaudhary. Hello. How did you come on Tuesday today? May God grant integrity! Mars is such a planet. You think something and something else happens. - What do you mean? - Well... I'm not a gossipmonger. But I'm loyal to you. So I'm compelled to tell you... that junior Chaudhary loves Razia, who lives in a mud house. May God grant integrity! How do you know? I saw it myself. May God grant integrity! Childhood friends won't fight. And it's your habit to make a mountain out of a molehill. It's not a lie. May God grant integrity! Good. Let Aslam go to the city for his education. Everything will be fine. Razia, I'll carry a pot. Salma, you're Chaudhary's niece. Why take the trouble? It's every woman's duty to do housework. Whether she's rich or poor. My hands are working fine. You always consider me a stranger. I should think of you as kin and make you fill water every day. Leave it. I'll do it. Salma, if you like it so much, then carry my pot. Want me to fill the pot. Okay, son. It's time for your train. Now leave. But yes, don't forget to write letters. Listen. - Do reply to my letters. - Okay. - Okay, father. Goodbye. - Goodbye. Aunt. - Hello, aunt. - God bless you, son. Don't forget the villagers after going to the city. How can I forget all of you? I'm leaving my life in the village. Keep visiting us. Okay, goodbye. Goodbye, Razia. Goodbye. Hey! Oh God! Oh, my God! You, Banno? Being a woman, you hit a man? Why? You wanted to commit theft. What did you say? Thief? Don't you recognize decent people? Oh God, Banno! I came for a shave. I'm sorry. Sit. Brother must be coming. Sister gave me a thrashing before the brother's arrival. No. I'll leave. Listen. Don't tell brother I hit you. Oh God, Banno! Would any man say that? Then go. - May I ask you something, Banno? - Yes. - You didn't do the right thing. - What? What was the need to hit a dying man? Are you ill? Not just ill, I'm lying on my deathbed. Deathbed? Then make arrangements for your funeral. - If brother comes, he'll also... - Show the wonder of his hands. Okay. Goodbye. Hello, Hazarimal. Hello, Kalu. May God grant integrity! Do you want your beard shaved? - Yes, Kalu. Something like that. - Come here. You're clean-shaven. Yes. It's done, Kalu. I'll leave. It's done. - It's done. - Yes. It's done. It's done. It's done. - Brother. - Yes. - Freshen up. Then eat lunch. You eat lunch. I'll eat a feast. May God grant integrity! - Is that so? - Yes. Fix people's marriage and have a feast. Whose marriage did you arrange? It's none of your business. Go and eat lunch. I'll take Razia and aunt to Chaudhary. May God grant integrity! May God grant integrity, Mr. Chaudhary! - Aunt is here. - Come. - Hello. - Hello. - Greetings. God bless you, dear. Salma. Look, your aunt is here. Sit. Both of you go inside. Sister, I troubled you for a noble deed. It's no trouble, Mr. Chaudhary. I'll give you good news. I've chosen a boy for your daughter Razia. Before Aslam, I'm worried about Nazir. Yes, the late Bashir's son, right? You know he's a nice boy. I have to conduct his marriage. What say you? When you're his guardian, what objection can I have? It's done, sister. Razia and Nazir will get married on Friday. Once Aslam returns from the city... I'll marry him to Salma. Congratulations to both of you. May God grant integrity! Congratulations, sister. You have got such a suitable groom. You're crying? If poor people are destined for happiness... why would they cry? - Kalu. - Yes? - Tell the truth. - Sure. To whom is uncle marrying me? - Tell me. - Shall I tell you? - Yes. - For sure? - Yes. First give me five pennies. May God grant integrity! Oh my! Here. - Yes. - Now tell me. - Your marriage will be conducted... - Yes. With Razia who lives in a mud house. May God grant integrity! - Kalu. - Yes. - Is she very pretty? Yes. It's your good fortune that you got her. - May God grant integrity! - For sure. For sure. Shall I distribute the wedding invitations? - Sure. Sure. Go. Don't delay. - Okay. Goodbye. Mister, covertly Sir, don't meet covertly Don't meet Don't converse through the eyes Don't converse Mister, covertly Sir, don't meet covertly Don't meet Don't converse through the eyes Don't converse Don't look at me with sly eyes Sly eyes A voice emanates from my heart From my heart Don't drop the curtain and turn day into night Don't turn day into night Don't converse through the eyes Don't converse Mister, covertly Sir, don't meet covertly Don't meet The Punjabi man says I'm the queen of his heart The Marathi man says you're a gorgeous woman The Marwadi man says you have a beautiful face The Gujarati man says you dance splendidly Don't talk about this man from Delhi... this moustache man, this man carrying a stick Yes, don't talk Don't converse through the eyes Don't converse Mister, covertly Sir, don't meet covertly Yes. Don't meet Don't converse through the eyes Yes. Don't converse Junior Chaudhary, may God bless you! May God grant patience to this unfortunate Razia. Because decent girls sacrifice their love and life... for their elders' happiness. Aslam, now forget me. Forget this wretched Razia's face forever. When you read this letter... Razia's funeral must be going on. Helpless Razia who is going away from you forever. Hats off to our country's docile girls. They sacrifice their love, desires and life for their... elders' happiness and husband's service. This isn't a wedding procession. It's a funeral procession of Razia's desires. These aren't fireworks... but poor Razia's desires that are exploding. The entire village is watching the spectacle. Not a sigh escapes from Razia's lips. Chaudhary gave a loan to Nazir... and separated Razia from Aslam. A heart spoke and another heart heard A tragic saga This cruel world breaks the relations of love A heart spoke In the grief for her lover... the girl cries and burns Seeing the girl burning, her lover also burns A heart spoke See a tender flower There are infinite thorns hidden Who is our kin in this world? Who is a stranger? A heart spoke In the remembrance of the one who is leaving... my eyes shed tears and say It's okay to die, but don't ever fall in love A heart spoke and another heart heard A tragic saga This cruel world breaks the relations of love A heart spoke Why did you stop? Nazir, first go and tell her to cover her face. Cover it? In front of you? Oh no! Why cover her face? Come on. - Come on. - Let's go. Have a seat. You guys also sit. Razia. Come here. Today I'll introduce you to my greatest enemy. Nazir. Oh God! There are two friends too. Come here. I'll tell you who they are. Okay, I'll come. I'm fed up with this. You're still here. - Come on. - Where? My friends have come. No. I feel shy going in front of strangers. They aren't strangers. They're like my brothers. Come on. Come. Your veil has bothered me no end. Come. He's that enemy. Sadiq. Sister-in-law, hello. Hello. I don't know what to present to you. No need for this formality. Come. Let's have dinner. Come. Salma, sit. I'll show you a spectacle. No. I can't stay with useless girls like you even for a moment. - Her beloved has come. - Let him come. He's not taking her away. All of you envious girls are untrustworthy. I wouldn't even talk to such an ungrateful man. If you say anything against him, I'll smash your face. Forget it, forget it. Look, you shouldn't even mention his name. Just see all the things she's saying about him. You wrote so many letters. Did he send any reply? He must not have time from his studies. That's why he didn't reply. No matter what you say, I'm envious of him. Why? He'll take our darling friend away from us. Look, Salma. She's making him a villain. If God wills, she'll also marry a villain. Razia. Razia, junior Chaudhary has come. - Won't you come to meet him? - No, Banno. A married woman shouldn't mention an unknown man's name. Great! You were in love with him once upon a time. Today he's become a stranger. That was our childhood. For God's sake, don't remind me about him. Go. Let me fulfill my duty. Razia, you've changed completely. I haven't changed. The world has changed. God wills that Aslam leads a happy life with Salma. - Hello. - Bless you. Stop it. You've studied enough. - No need to study now. - Why? Because I've arrived. - You're not so pretty. - I'm better looking than you. You're mistaken. Me or you? The one who thinks she's beautiful. You also think you're very handsome. Had I been handsome, there wouldn't have been any grief. Why don't you say you're upset with me? No. Of course. The world teases me by your name. And you don't even speak to me properly. You've come after a long time. You didn't even ask me how I was. It's true. Men are heartless. Say something else. With God's grace, Aslam is young and Salma is also young. That's what I also mean. The boy passed his BA. The girl is also educated. In the entire village Chaudhary's house is the only house... where there's an educated girl. May God grant integrity! Priest, it's every parent's duty to educate their children. May God grant integrity, Mr Choudhary. Don't delay it now. Get them married quickly. As if it's not marriage, but a game. May God grant integrity, Mr. Chaudhary. For a long time there hasn't been a dance program in the village. There will be one as part of the marriage. Arrange for the dance program. Take money from me. That's what I wanted. May God grant integrity, Mr. Chaudhary! Eyes... Don't shoot arrows from the eyes Beloved, I am 16 years old I don't like your figure I don't like it without you What kind of unique love is this? Beloved, I am 16 years old Eyes... Don't shoot arrows from the eyes It's a vibrant world. Your love is what I desire It's a short life Beloved, I am 16 years old Eyes... Don't shoot arrows from the eyes We took oaths and fell in love Why did you lock eyes with a stranger then? Beloved, your love is not true Beloved, I am 16 years old Eyes... Don't shoot arrows from the eyes - Hello, uncle. - Hello. Come, Nazir. Sit. - Where are you going? - I was going to the fields, uncle. Son, take care of the garden too. I'm alone, uncle. How much can I do? Do I have hundreds of men? God bless brother Bashir. He was also alone. I work as hard as I can, uncle. Do you call sitting on a cot working hard? How will the work be done? I don't care about that. I'll do as much as I can. It means you don't realize you have to repay my debt too. I'll repay it when I have money. I won't give up my life over a debt. You are also right. How will you arrange for money when you don't have any? Be grateful to God, Nazir. I lent you money. If you had borrowed money from a moneylender... he'd have seized your house, not to mention the garden. May God grant integrity! Moneylenders are very cruel. Look, Nazir. I'll explain something to you. If you heed me, sell the garden to me. I'll give you the rest of the money right now. You've given me a tight slap, uncle. I'm poor, but not a cheater. I owe you money, But I'm not dishonest. I'm ready to sell myself. But I'm not ready to sell my ancestor's garden. If you're truly a principled man, give the proof. If God wills, you'll get it soon. Sister-in-law. Where are you going? My husband is in the fields. I'm taking food for him. In this scorching heat? Heat doesn't bother us villagers. You city people should fear it. A flower withers in heat, sister-in-law. As long as the flower is attached to the branch... it doesn't face any danger. You're so disloyal, sister-in-law. I've come to see you. And you don't even care for me. A woman's life revolves around her husband. It's every woman's duty to look after her husband's comfort. This is your goodness, Razia. You're beautiful. Moreover, loyal too. It's great. Razia, your pride lies in ruling hearts. Why are you saying all this? I mean, at times God also plays a prank on his men. He gave a gem to a blind man. He gave wealth to an insane man. Nazir won't value your goodness. If a beautiful girl like you had married a man like me... I swear, Razia... your name would have been famous all over the world. Remain in your senses. From the time I first saw you, I lost my senses. Aren't you ashamed to speak to another woman like that? When my friend isn't a stranger why would you be a stranger? Shameless. Amazing, sister-in-law! - You look pretty even in anger. - Shut up. Go home. I'll come with you. I'm not going to run away. Go. Go home. Sadiq goes to your home all the time. I don't like it. Razia, Sadiq is always welcome in my house. You should know that Sadiq is my childhood friend. I trust his friendship completely. You should trust him too. I don't trust people blindly. He seems to be a dangerous man. I won't hear anything against my friend. - And I can't say anything in his favor. - Razia! Go. Don't make this mistake again. May God grant integrity, Mr. Chaudhary! Nazir will have to sell the garden to you. God forbid, Kalu. I'm not greedy for his garden. I just wanted to see whether Nazir has his ancestor's dignity. Who's concerned about money? The way I gave it to Aslam, I gave it to Nazir too. Really? I'll work hard to repay Chaudhary's loan. But the garden, that my ancestors have grown with... their sweat and blood, is a beautiful part of my life... and I have a right to it. Remember, Sadiq. I'll do anything for it. But I won't let strangers get hold of it. Long live, Nazir! If this is how the youths of our village think... then we'll definitely change our fortunes. Here. This is a diamond ring. Sell it and buy happiness for yourself. Take it. I don't mind ruining my life, Sadiq. But I can't sell it. Here. It means you don't trust my friendship. I trust your friendship more than myself, Sadiq. So why are you refusing to take the ring? Because debt is friendship's enemy. Stop this nonsense. Here. I don't want to take this ring If you sympathize with me, show me some other way. Yes. Go to Lahore and meet Rahim Bakht today. He's a bank director. He'll give you money immediately. I'll write him a letter today. How will he recover the money? You'll have to give him fruits and food grains every year. In a few years the money will be repaid. And your honor will also be saved. Sadiq, I will definitely go. You've given me new hope. I'll go and tell Razia. Don't make this mistake, Nazir. Woman is man's biggest weakness. You'll be ready to sacrifice your family's honor... if you see Razia shed a few tears. Okay. Take care of Razia in my absence. - I'll leave. - Don't worry, my friend. - Okay. Bye. - Goodbye. Nazir has left for the station. He shouldn't return to the village or reach the station. Understand? Here. Diamond ring. It's worth Rs.500. Once the work is done you will be paid more than your expectations. That's it? Okay, Sadiq. I trust you. Tonight I also have work at that same place. I'll finish off Nazir too. I'll finish off Nazir too. Oh Lord! The caravan of life never stops O Lord! It never stops We cover the journey of life happily All of us reach to our destinations Oh Lord! We never stop Oh Lord! The caravan of life never stops Oh Lord! It never stops Oh Lord! Two worlds The town of every caravan The journey gets covered easily No trouble befalls Oh Lord! It never stops O Lord! The caravan of life never stops Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! What's going on? Don't you people fear God? How have the poor people harmed you? Why are you troubling them? Who are you to stop us? Get lost. Do your work. Beware. Why did you stop, sir? Ramlal's body is burning. - Go and bring his bones. - Huh? Oh, my God! Are you hungry? Oh, my God! Don't you know? Sir has come up with an idea. Not at all. Lamp lights lamp. Today I want to start a fire with fire. Oh, my God! Whose house do you want to destroy? Tell us clearly. Put Ramlal's bones in Nazir's house. - And set it ablaze. - Oh, my God! Go, quickly. - Here. - Give. - Wazir. - Yes. Inform the village that Nazir has has been charred. Beware. Nazir, it's you. Met you at the right time. I was looking for you. Who? Mehmood? No, your death. No! What happened, Razia? What can you be besides terrifying death? You don't pity poor people. You don't feel innocent people's pain. You're not human. You're a brute. A brute. What's going on? What happened? What are you looking at? Tell me. Where's my husband? Razia, come to your senses. My dear, you married me. Then why did you leave me alone to wander on the streets? Tell me. Where will I go now? Look. I'm without adornments. I've become destitute. Tears have washed away my kohl. Call me. Your Razia is calling you. You won't speak. I'm imploring you needlessly. Perhaps God will take pity on me. But no. Why would he take pity? He enjoys being capricious. He laughs when people cry. No. God, forgive me. Your will is acceptable to me. Razia. Your tears, your pleas are of no use to the dead. In fact, your tears will hurt his soul. What do I do? My heart doesn't agree. I couldn't serve him. That's what I regret. You can't cry over this grief, Razia. If you want the deceased's soul to rest in peace... fulfill his wish. - Wish? - Yes. Turn sorrow into happiness. Instead of crying, learn to laugh. If he liked you as a married woman... - then live like a married woman. - Sadiq. It's what Nazir wanted. You should give me the same place he had. I'm ready to support you. For God's sake, Sadiq. Bury your dirty intentions in this graveyard. He was my friend. That's why I have to hold his remembrance close to my heart. I'll have to support his widow. If you want to support me, support me as your sister. So that you make a name for yourself. I've earned as much fame as I want. Now I'll fulfill my goal. It will be fulfilled when you will become mine. - Leave me, scoundrel. - I always get what I want. Sadiq. Learn a lesson. You're misbehaving with an innocent widow in the graveyard. Her husband died recently. This is what I also want. This poor woman should not remain a widow. Why don't you say... that you want to lay the foundation of marriage on your friend's body. Mister, why are you trying to intimidate me? Because of your father's favors today Nazir is dead. Death doesn't need an excuse. There's love in an elder's scolding too. Why do you view my love with hatred? I want to marry my friend's widow and give her love. Sadiq. Under the pretext of friendship you want to satiate your lust... for a miserable and unfortunate woman. - Don't you feel ashamed? - Aslam, don't try to argue with me. Or else you'll die young. It's the duty of youths to help the weak. You won't get Razia as long as I'm alive. Fine. I'll see your power too. May I come in? Silence is also a kind of permission. I see. You seem angry. - What's the matter? - Nothing. If it's nothing, why are you angry? Why are you irritating me? I'm just asking you where you're coming from. - From the graveyard. - May God protect you. Why do you go to the graveyard every day? To find the sign of my grave. God forbid. Aslam, I notice that from the time Nazir died... you've changed a lot. Because I'm grieving his death. Razia should be the one to grieve his death. But you're more miserable than she. It's none of your business. Why not? I know your woe isn't because of Nazir's death... but because of Razia's love. The love that was doused when Nazir got married... is igniting once again. So that you can kill my desire. Love is the same that was before. Because I've loved Razia since childhood. And I will always love her. Aslam, today you have killed my desires. You've killed my desire of marrying you. Now, you tell me. How will I face the villagers? They think I'm going to marry you. I love only you You love strangers My heart wondered if you were treacherous You are treacherous I love only you It's the game of destiny It's the union of troubles My heart is aching You are my comfort I love only you It's futile to cry In the end you have to perish I am smoldering You are a gust of wind I love only you The one who broke my heart... hear this before you go My husband got fed up of your demands and he died. I'll live to repay every penny. Even if I have to beg. I'm sorry, dear. No. I don't want to be the daughter of such a man... that conducts poor boys and girls' marriages in order to earn fame. And then quietly backstabs them and kills them. Razia, you didn't recognize me. Who doesn't know landlords that step on poor people's bodies to stand tall? They give false assurances. When their work is done, they shower their wrath. For God's sake don't call me that. Why not? You are a proud rich man who ruined my family. My husband died because of you. And today, because of you I'm waiting for my death. Razia, your grief has driven you mad. The villagers turned my grief into anger. The villagers are illiterates. They think I'm mad. To ruin the sapling I planted. - Uncle. - Razia, you're my daughter. That's why your anger is also dear to me. Razia, with God and his messenger as the witnesses... I'm telling you I've cancelled Nazir's debt. So that his soul rests in peace. From today this old man will consider it his duty... to fulfill your needs. Don't embarrass me so much. You're my sole support. Make God your supporter, dear. I'm only his unworthy devotee. You are the lord of my heart... a part of my soul You control everything By your will the garden flourishes You show the light in storms If you want, you can turn a life barren If you want, you can bring happiness to life May I come in? Come. Sit. What brings you here? I deeply regret I'm alive even after seeing you in this condition. And I can't even help you in this grief. Grief has become my destiny. It's true. We used to play together in childhood. So we should share our sorrow too. God forbid. What sorrow do you have? Don't ask, Razia. I finished my education and left the city with high hopes. Like a bird that tries to fly faster than the wind... to reach its nest. But when I came here, I found out... my world had been destroyed. And my father was responsible for it. Don't say that. Your father wanted to build a palace for his capable son. If a poor girl's hut had remained there... it would have been an eyesore. Razia, I wasn't here then. You also didn't tell him not to ruin our lives. And that you're Aslam's childhood love. Decent girls don't speak. They simply shed tears. If the person understands, it's her good fortune. Or else grief becomes her fate. No, Razia. Come and stay in my house. Or else you'll suffocate and die. - This is my last wish. - No. That rogue Sadiq is after your honor thinking you're an orphan. How can anyone snatch God's belongings from someone? It's my duty to take you home and protect you from that devil. No. That's not your house. It's Salma's house. It's inauspicious for an unfortunate widow... to live in a married woman's house. This is an illiterate women's superstition. Salma is educated. And this is what I expect from her. She'll never let illiteracy hinder her duty. So you can come and live in my house without worry. I swear on God, Razia. I'm not saying this because of my love. But my duty as a human being compels me... to support a hapless woman. For God's sake don't worry about my grief. I know you're an innocent girl's hope... and an influential family's son. May God keep you happy! Go and fulfill your father's wishes. But how is that possible? There's mourning in one house... and a marriage celebration in another? Humans can't change misfortune into fortune. I've lost everything. Happiness, husband, solace and peace. For God's sake leave. I'm scared of everything. Okay, Razia, I'll leave. But you're under my oath. Make yourself strong and try to walk on God's path. This too shall pass. Goodbye. Oh Lord. Give my broken heart so much strength... that I can walk on the path shown by you... and become a noble woman. May God grant integrity! This is the first time I've heard of a haunting spirit. I've never heard of it before. Why won't his spirit wander? He died unexpectedly. This is how a decent man should be. He lost his life. But what's the use of wandering in the village? Sadiq used to say he loved Razia a lot. May God grant integrity! My wife also loved me a lot. But her soul never visited me. And he's not leaving her even after dying. Don't say that, Kalu. - If he comes, it will be terrible. - Yes, he's right. Really? Stay awake! Oh heart, who shall I tell about your grief? The world is heartless People are cruel Oh heart, who shall I tell about your grief? The world of my love didn't last for even two days I wonder who cast an evil eye on my love? All my desires remained unfulfilled What kind of flame burned my love? My love had not reached its peak Oh heart, who shall I tell about your grief? Why do the moon and the stars hiccup at my plight? My eyes are filled with tears Why does love burst into flames? Perhaps with the aid of love you forget everything I will spend my youth crying Oh heart, who shall I tell about your grief? Ghost! Look. Nazir's ghost. Beat him! Beat him! Beat him! Beat him! Beat him! Beat him! Beat him! Beat him! Razia. Razia. Recognize me. I'm not a ghost. I'm your husband. I'm unfortunate Nazir, the cure for your loneliness. Recognize me. Feel me, Razia. Put your hand on my heart and see. Your name is in each of my heartbeats. Beat him! Beat him! Beat him! Beat him! I don't understand how the ghost carried her away. But we can't deny what all the villagers are saying, son. Where are you taking me? Nowhere, dear. You're home. And where is he? - Dear, you were dreaming. - Dreaming? Father, I don't think it right to leave her alone. Of course. It's our duty to protect her. Come, dear. Come and stay in our house. No, uncle. I won't leave this house. Uncle, don't trouble her so late at night. Today I'll sleep here. This is also fine. Okay, dear. We'll leave. Today your sister will stay here. Come, Aslam. Let Razia rest. Salma, it was him. Absolutely him. I can swear. It can be possible, sister. Now you won't have to stay in this house. I'm not even dying. So that I get rid of this barren house. God forbid. This beautiful face wasn't made... for it to die before its time. One day I'll die crying. May your enemies die! Sister, if you don't mind, may I say something? What? It's very difficult for a woman to stay alone. So I suggest you better get married. Salma. Don't say such things. Don't you know? By wasting your youth like this... you'll become God and the prophet's culprit. No, Salma. I know. You marry only once. You cannot marry again. If you're young, you can marry. Because I know a boy who is fighting and struggling for you. Salma, what are you saying? It's not time to tell you. Because I haven't decided yet. Which is greater? Love or duty? - Salma, listen. - I've heard. Now it's time to do something. Salma, are you trying to rub salt in my wounds? Not at all. I've brought salve for you. - Salve? - Yes. I won't be able to keep you happy. Your broken heart will always call out to Razia. But I won't let my voice reach to my lips. That's so you don't feel bad. No, Aslam. My duty is compelling me... not to be a barrier between you and Razia. That's why I'm insisting... you go and tell your father to give Razia back to you. Salma, how can you say that? If I marry Razia, father's wishes and your life will be ruined. This orphan's life had never flourished that it will now be ruined. Aslam, you are under Razia's oath. Support that hapless woman. She has nobody besides you in the world. Salma, have you gone crazy? You want to dig your own grave. Don't worry about me. I have uncle as my guardian. I can see you and spend my life. But people's taunts won't let that poor hapless Razia live. Aslam... it's my first and last plea. Marry Razia. Go. Get your father's permission. Go. Arrange her marriage to someone. If you have a good friend, tell him. There is no flaw in the girl. She's beautiful, talented and brave. In today's world no man will marry a widow... regardless of how good she is. - Then? - When there is no flaw in her... why don't you bring her to your house? What do you mean? Don't you feel ashamed to talk to your father like that? You want me to make a widow of my daughter-in-law? And throw this hapless girl out... whom I have raised to be your wife. No, father. Salma is unmarried. She has you. She can marry the best man. But who will accept widow Razia? You're young and emotional. I've seen the world. I can see a person's eyes and read his heart. I have raised Salma. I can feel her pain. I know her desires. She'll be ruined after losing you. I won't see her being ruined. You can't see Salma's devastation. But you can see your son's devastation. You don't even know how you have destroyed me... by getting Razia married to Nazir. I've seen my desires being crushed. I suppressed the pain of my love. And you didn't find out... - because your vision is clouded. - Aslam! Get lost! Go away! Father, if young people's desires get the aid of elders... they can change the world. From among widows and unmarried girls, widows should be chosen... so that people realize their mistake. It's not the question of one Razia. But it's a question of countless girls like Razia... who are widows and leading miserable lives. I want to follow humanity and show the right path to the world. Because I know... a father's loving heart will make every sacrifice for his son. Salma, don't cry. Rest assured... I won't let Aslam ruin your life. You won't have any sorrow as long as I'm here. No, uncle. For a brother's happiness a sister's tears are appealing to you... to make Razia your daughter-in-law. Because brother Aslam has loved Razia since childhood. Oh Lord. Forgive this culprit's sins. Protect me from evil. Shower goodness on me. And grant peace to the soul of the dead. - Amen. - The Almighty... can grant solace to restless souls. But it's in your hands to grant peace to Nazir's soul, Razia. Beware. If you're not afraid of a human's power... at least fear God's wrath. It's wrong to say such things. Whether you think I'm an atheist or a Muslim... but I'll say this sincerely. Unless you marry again, Razia... neither the deceased's soul can rest in peace... nor can your heart find peace. That's why our community permits second marriages. Our community permits second marriages. But it doesn't compel anyone. It depends on an individual's wish. What's your intention? I intend to spend my life in God's service You're young and can't spend your whole life like that, Razia. And a woman's intention is weaker than a thread. You'll have to marry again. That too to me. This is my final decision. Oh Lord! Your decision isn't God's decision... that I should bow before you. Many great people have bowed before me, Razia. Who are you? Listen to me carefully. If you want to live decently, remember this. Razia, you should always rebuff such a devil. Salma. Leave here! You come to a stranger's house and harass a widow? Don't you feel ashamed? Salma, don't argue with him. Tell him to leave politely. Or else I'll gather people and have him beaten. Quiet. Look, I am saying again. Leave quietly. Or else... - You'll scream and gather people? - Yes. Fine. I'm leaving. But remember. You got in Sadiq's way. Salma, why did you scold him like that? He's very dangerous. Sister, grief has made you weak. These men deserve to be spoken to like that. Who do I have now... to stop this nuisance? Why not, sister? Aslam is eager to fulfill this duty. Salma, what are you saying? I'm speaking the truth, sister. Aslam is yours. And he'll always be yours. No, Salma. For God's sake don't say such things... that will make me cry. The time of crying is gone. Now I'm waiting for the day when I'll dress you as a bride. No, Salma. I can't buy happiness for myself... at the cost of your happiness. Aslam is yours. But I can't look after him the way you can look after him. I've studied both of you. I've overheard your conversations. Salma, forgive me. I'll never open my mouth again. - Even if you suffocate and die? - Yes. This is what I don't want. Because of me two youths will always face hardships. Here. From today you hold this. No, Salma. I can't kill your desires. I swear on God, sister. If you don't agree... I'll kill myself. Salma, what are you saying? If I marry Aslam despite knowing this... not just everyone else, but I'll abhor myself, too. Salma, listen. Salma. Salma. Leave me. Your voice can't escape from this room. Remember... the end for those who betray their friends is very bad, Sadiq. Salma. Wait. Now do you see the result of interfering with Sadiq? Sadiq. You've done me a great favor. Or else I would have had to live with a heavy heart. I'm happy. You'll also become an unfortunate one like me. Razia will marry Aslam. I've made all the arrangements. Now your evil hands won't reach to her. Sister. Sister. Forgive me. Till now I was feigning ignorance... and being a barrier between you and Aslam. Aslam. Run! Run! - It's terrible! It's terrible! - What happened? - There are two corpses in my house. - Two corpses? Yes. Nazir's ghost has killed Salma and Mehmood. - Murdered them? - Yes, I wonder how I escaped. That's strange. Mr. Chaudhary, Nazir's ghost has killed Salma. - What did you say? - What? - It's a lie. A lie. - Not a lie, Mr. Chaudhary. The entire village agrees. If Razia stays in the village, the entire village will be destroyed. - Oh Lord! - I don't believe this. I'll find out the truth. Throw Razia out of the village! So that Nazir's ghost never haunts the village again. Razia is certainly the bearer of bad tidings. Throw her out of the village. Yes, sir. Throw her out. We should put pressure on Chaudhary. The villagers' lives are more precious than Razia's life. Sadiq was saying that Nazir's ghost is haunting the village. And it killed Salma. Oh Lord! Give peace to that haunting soul. But how had Salma harmed him? Oh Lord! What's happening? Throw Razia out of the village! Aslam. Listen, son. Throw Razia out of the village! Razia won't be thrown out of the village. We don't want to talk to you. Call Mr. Chaudhary. Aslam is right. Will the villagers lose their lives like that? If Nazir's ghost is killing people... how is that Razia's fault? Mr. Chaudhary, the other day you saw... Nazir's ghost carry Razia away. If he had succeeded, he wouldn't have come to the village again. Can you take the responsibility? Aren't you sad about Salma's murder? Who doesn't feel sad at his child's death? I had pinned my hopes on Salma. God knows better. That's why she died. Mr. Chaudhary, these things hold true... unless tragedy strikes your family. If this had happened with Aslam... it would have opened your eyes. Absolutely true. - Won't you throw Razia out of the village? - No. You'll have to throw her out. Who has the courage to throw Razia out of the village? I say leave. Do whatever you want. Razia is under my care. Fine. We'll see. Razia, where are you going? - Wherever fate takes me. - But why? If this is what the villagers want, I can't stay here either. No, Razia. I can't leave you alone like that. Shame on such an influential Chaudhary... who can't even give shelter to a widow. Come, dear. Stay in my house. When I'm destined to be homeless, what can you do? No, dear. I have ruined your life. I'll have to fix it. I've come to beg to you, dear. Light up my bleak house, dear. No, uncle. I am unlucky. I lost my parents in childhood. - In youth I lost my husband. - Don't say that. It's all God's will. Please agree. Aslam also loves you. - Uncle. - Dear, heed this old man. I don't want to hear anything but yes. Fulfill poor Salma's last wish. She lost her life in the desire of seeing both of you married. But I'm afraid of my fate. Those who walk on the path of God should never fear anyone. It's the will of God, dear. Just say yes. - Uncle. - Bless you, dear. You heeded me. God bless you. My heart is wounded and broken. Give it solace. Ansari, why is there lightning today? Why did it hide? Tell me. Yes. Oh prophet, it's Friday night. The girl is inside. And I am outside. Why? Why did you come inside without permission? Oh, my God! Does one need permission to come to one's house? You should have at least knocked. What is this? In earlier times people used to knock. But nowadays people sing and enter. Oh, my God! Tell me. What do you want? I want what you want. Oh my innocent heart, I am what you are. I used to think you were a man. Are you also a woman? Oh, my God! Banno, it's not that. In fact, like you people, I'm also a barber. May God grant integrity, Ansari! Are you really our sibling? Here, take the hookah. - Yes, Kalu. - Yes. The only difference between you and me is that... you're a traditional barber, and I'm a modern barber. I swear on you, Kalu. In Mumbai I have shaved many rich and wealthy people's beards. May God grant integrity, Ansari! If you had told me before that you're a barber... by now I would have got Banno married to you. Better late than never. Oh, my God! - Kalu. - Yes. Make arrangements for the marriage. I'll also start the arrangements. Come on. - Bye. - Bye. - Bye. - May God grant integrity! Ansari, today something significant happened. That's why I brought you here. Oh, my God! What's the matter? I'm telling the truth, Ansari. Aslam's marriage to Razia has been arranged. It'll be tomorrow. - Razia's marriage? - Yes. Oh, my God! What are you saying? My wife is getting remarried while I'm alive. This can't happen. Razia, I will certainly save you. I'll save you, Razia! - I see you. - Wherever I look - I see you here. - I see you there The stars peep at you Fireflies gesture to you Just lift your eyes Scenarios are looking at you My eyes look for you all the time May nobody cast an evil eye on you! - I see you. - Wherever I look - I see you here. - I see you there The saga of your name dwells in my eyes Life has started changing I am shedding tears of joy There's a smile on my lips and tears in my eyes My eyes are downcast out of modesty When I lift my eyes and look around... - I see you. - Wherever I look - I see you here. - I see you there Come on, girls. Dinner is ready. Bring the bride along too. Come on. You guys have dinner. Come, Aslam. You come too. Come on. Let's have dinner. Father! Why did Aslam scream? - Someone has killed Aslam. - Aslam? Mr. Chaudhary, Aslam's been murdered. What happened? - What happened? Move. - My Aslam. My son. Aslam. What happened, son? Who couldn't see your youth? For God's sake, fetch a doctor from the city. My lifelong wealth is being snatched. My son. My chest is bursting. Give me assurance. Father. Razia. Razia. Razia. Come. Your groom is calling you. My son wanted to marry you. Razia, see how your groom is bloodied. Aslam, your Razia is here. Open your eyes, son. For God's sake, don't leave your father. Hold this old man, son. Have patience, Mr. Chaudhary. My young son is dying. And I should have patience? Father. No. I will be ruined. I will be destroyed. Have mercy on me. Aslam, pity my old age. Be strong, Mr. Chaudhary. This is how long he was destined to live. No, heartless one. Don't take my son away from me. Aslam, don't leave me. Take me along with you, too. I'll fulfill your needs over there too. You aren't heeding this old man. Pity your bride. You were paving a new way for the world. Get up. The world has come to you. And you aren't even looking. Son, what did I do that you're angry with me? Mr. Chaudhary. God, forgive me. My son's death has driven me crazy. Grant me patience. My Lord, I'm sending what belonged to you... with trembling hands. Accept it. Ansari. Ansari. Nazir's ghost is going there. Beat him. Beat him. Beat him. No, I'm still a married woman. Aslam, come. This flowery bed is waiting for you. Salma, forgive me. I couldn't safeguard what belonged to you. I congratulate you with tears in my eyes. Your groom has come to you. Wait. I'll also come to you. Hocus pocus. Do away with the evil spirit. Hey! Oh, my God! Kalu, what's going on? Ansari, you? May God grant integrity! She's been possessed by a spirit! Oh, my God! I'm also possessed by love. But Nazir has possessed her. I see. So Nazir has started troubling us too. May God grant integrity, Ansari! Just spread the holy smoke. I'll fetch a talisman from the priest. - Yes, Kalu. Go quickly. - Yes. - We should get rid of one spirit at least. - Yes. May God grant integrity, Ansari! Don't stop. Spread the holy smoke until I return. Yes, Kalu. Go. Don't worry. Well done, Banno. If you hadn't played this charade... Kalu would never have left me alone with you. Stop it, Banno. I'm not Kalu to get duped by you. I know that Nazir is alive. How can his spirit come here? Oh, my God! What have I revealed? Banno, Nazir is a ghost. I see. So it's your mischief. I'll devour you. No, Nazir. It's not my fault. It's Sadiq's doing. You're lying. Nazir, I swear on Banno. I am speaking the truth. Sadiq was in love with Razia. So he hired Mehmood to kill you. - You're also his friend. Rogue! - Oh my! Nazir, I swear on Banno. I'll end my friendship with Sadiq. Here. I'm holding my ears. You're holding your ears. But you killed Aslam and Salma. What are you saying, Nazir? Sadiq killed all of them. A devil who commits atrocities on a weak woman? Get out. I don't even want to see your face. - Oh, my God! You're Banno. - I am Banno. You've confessed your crimes to me. You're a devil's associate. But I'm telling you that I feel remorse. Go and tell Razia who's facing hardships because of you people. Go and apologize to her. Go. Razia. You're still alive? Whichever house you go, there is mourning. You're a witch who destroys homes. You still want to live. Shame on you and your destiny. Go. If you have shame, go and drown. So that the world is cleansed of you. Now you'll gain peace and solace only after dying. Nowhere else. It's true. Death is better than this life. Razia. Razia. Leave from here. The witch might cast her shadow on you. Oh, my God! She's a beautiful nuisance! To hell with this nuisance. She's more dangerous than the plague. Wretched woman. I wonder how many people she's killed. Whose name are you taking? After ruining the entire village she's leaving. I spit on your face! Razia. Razia. Razia. Razia, listen. Razia. - Razia, where are you going? - Wherever death takes me. This can't be. How have I wronged you people? You won't even let me die peacefully. If I let you die, how will I face the world? Razia, forgive me. Beware if you hold my hand. If a brother can't hold his sister's hand, who else will hold it? - Brother? - Yes. No. I can't trust you people. Because you're that devil's associate. No, Razia. I curse that devil and I bow my head before you in shame. Before now, whatever hardships you faced were because of Sadiq. We ruined you by remaining his friends. But now, I can't see your plight. Forgive me, sister. Go. I forgive you. But a brother can't leave his sister to wander the streets. I promise you. I will certainly reunite you with your husband. - What? He is alive? - Yes, Nazir lives. Trust me. Come with me. If you're innocent, then maybe he wants to test you. Test me? You're right, sir. Perhaps he wants to test whether... I can save my noble wife despite being helpless. I'm going. Pray for me, sir. Son, I'm a culprit like you. Go and pray at prophet Saiyed's tomb. He is God's chosen one. He is his messenger. On his saying, God will give you relief from your hardships. Haven't you heard? Destiny changes when he casts his sight on you. The leader of the holy city of Medina The master of the holy city of Medina My heart is filled with your love The leader of the holy city of Medina The master of the holy city of Medina The ocean without any shore You are my supporter Save me from the storm The master of the holy city of Medina The leader of the holy city of Medina I have nobody besides you Save me I'm dying. This isn't called living The leader of the holy city of Medina The master of the holy city of Medina My eyes are moist. My heart is thumping The leader of the holy city of Medina My face is free of scars. God, you heard my prayer. Sadiq. What are you doing? What will you gain by torturing a hapless woman? The woman who has snatched my peace, slumber and solace. She's hapless? Of course. She is hapless and chaste too. So better forget her. Forget her? And let my crimes go in vain? The woman for whom I betrayed Nazir's friendship? I killed Salma. I killed Mehmood. I murdered Aslam and thus killed Chaudhary's desires. I should forget that Razia? It isn't possible. I have destroyed so many lives for my happiness. She'll have to be mine. Satan, if you can hear, then hear. Even your conscience abhors you and your intentions. Quiet! Sir... It's the blood of those whom you have tortured. Now you can't fulfill your wish. Because, seeing your dirty crimes I've severed my ties with you. Ansari, being Sadiq's associate... you're afraid of the invisible one? Beware if you say anything against him. Go and tell him to try and stop Sadiq if he can. Go, get lost. Sadiq. Sadiq. Come back. I've told Razia that Nazir is alive. Ansari, you have shortened your life by revealing this secret. I don't care. I've regained my lost integrity. I also curse you. First I have to crush Razia's obstinacy. Razia is not like those weak women. I know she's a devout wife. That's why I have to win her using Nazir. Fine. I will also have to get the villagers' help... to save my sister's honor. - Wazir, go and inform the police. - Fine. I'll leave immediately. - Jhamma. - Hello. Will you support me? What are you saying, Mr. Sadiq? If I don't support you, where else will I go? - Fine. You'll have to do my work. - Tell me. I'm going to kidnap Razia. Stand outside and keep watch. If Nazir or Ansari or anyone comes kill him. Got that? This is what will happen, Mr. Sadiq. Sadiq! Yes. The worshiper of your beauty. The man crazy for your love. Razia, see my desires. I am bloodied and yet offering you my hand. I say lift your hands in atonement. See how nature is striking lightning... to destroy a tyrant like you. Razia, lightning, thunder and storm... cannot stop Sadiq's desires. It can't come in the way of Sadiq's immense love. You're a devil who is labeling his lust as love and thus defaming love. Razia, till now you've reciprocated... my love and wishes with hatred. But remember. Today I'll ensure that my desires come true. But Razia will be dead by then. She'll leave her body and her life. Let me see you escape from my clutches now. Who can protect you from me? The Almighty who saved Ibrahim from the fire... Yunus from the fish and the boat from the storm. These stories can give assurance to weaklings. But it can't sway Sadiq's strong resolution. - For God's sake, don't mock him. - What will happen? The same thing that happened to Shadab, Namrood and Firon. I swear on the Almighty. Nazir is alive. Nobody else knows this secret besides me. It's Sadiq's ruse. Razia, don't enrage me with your nonsense... or else you'll die. The threat of death can never snatch a woman's destiny and integrity. But today, you'll have to marry me and fulfill my wish. Deceiver. Razia knows her husband is alive. But he can't come here alive. My accomplice is at the door waiting to kill him. Oh heartless demon. Don't you feel ashamed to kill people? Shame, decorum, integrity. These are the aids of weaklings. Sadiq won't be influenced by all this. Tell me, do you agree or not? Lord, it's the last hour of my trial. Please protect my honor and dignity. Razia, now you should take Sadiq's name. And lovingly, too. Sadiq has become lustful. He wants to destroy Nazir's home and satiate his lust. Sadiq did so much to get Razia. I beg to you for compassion and justice. For God's sake leave me alone. Finally, beauty had to bow before love. Get up, Razia. Your place lies in my heart and not at my feet. Rogue! A woman's honor isn't so cheap... that your dirty hands could touch it. You'll have to sell your life, honor and wishes to me. Never! I will die for my honor. But I'll never stigmatize womanhood. Look, your obstinacy shouldn't become the cause of your death. I prefer that death to thousands of lives... that save a woman's dignity. Your life lies in my hand and not in God's hand. Oh Lord! Beware! You hit a woman and stigmatize manhood! Oh demon! Who? Nazir? Yes. God has kept me alive to destroy your lust. I will give you another chance since you're my friend. Save your life from Sadiq and leave. Keep quiet! You've tarnished our friendship. Under the guise of friendship you've played such a game... that people will always spit on your name. You fool. Not I, but you're responsible for this mistake. Yes. My fault was that I considered a brute like you my friend. Tell me. How did I wrong you? How did Razia harm you? What crime did Aslam and Salma commit... that you murdered them? Today their death is compelling me to kill you. Nazir, leave before I raise my hand. Leave? And spare your life? Beat him! Beat him! Beat him! Beat him! Nazir, forgive me. For God's sake. Forgive you? You evil man. Today you're talking about God and the prophet. Don't you feel ashamed? Rogue! - My brother. - Don't call me your brother. Nazir, let me atone. Oh prophet, help me. Oh Lord. Scoundrel. Look, God has also shut his door to you. Get lost! Oh tyrant You're taking revenge from a tyrant You're a noble man When that omniscience is seen... heads bow before you You separate people You unite people You destroy people. You allow people to flourish Your wonder How do I thank you? You have gratified me. You snatched one son and gave me two children in return. My patience has paid off.
