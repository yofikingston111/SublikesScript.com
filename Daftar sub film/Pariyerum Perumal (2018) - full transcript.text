If you don’t like English you should stay quiet. Who said I don’t like English? That is how you behaved. I didn’t behave like that. Everybody treats me like that. Can I ask you something? You cleared English in grade 10 and 12 right? Then what is the problem? How much did you score in grade 10? 360. How much is it? Three Hundred and Sixty. How much do you think I scored? Sorry... 200, may be! -What? -Two Hundred! Three Hundred and Ninety. Three Hundred and Ninety! Yes. But I failed. How is that possible after scoring so high? How come? All because of your rotten English. Teachers did not know the language! I didn’t get it too. If it was only English... ...couldn’t you have copied? I did! Even then I failed. How? How do I say that! I hide small chits when I go for English exams. When I see the question paper... ...I won't know which chit to copy from. Only if the guy next to me helps... ...I can figure out which chit to use. That day they asked an essay I hid under my foot. I struggled so much to write... You got caught? No way! Then how did you fail? How do I say this? It took me 3 hours to copy that essay. I got 7 marks for that. That is all I scored! 7 marks?! How did you pass at all? An 'Akka' took pity on me during the re-examination. What? Time is running out! And you are just sitting, staring out the window. I don’t know anything, Akka. Sister? You are appearing for re-examination and still don't know anything? How many ever times I try I won't clear English. English is the only difficult subject for Sir? Alright! Tell me how many subjects did you fail in? Only this, Akka. 390 is my total score. Oh wow! You scored 390? Yes, Akka. Do you have anything to copy from? Take that and write. Everyone’s doing it. You write too. Somebody like this! Not just Akka. She is the first angel I saw. I asked you to write What are you doing? I don’t know which one to copy from. What do you mean? How many chits have you carried? Lots! Take it all out! Hey! Why are you laughing at everything? Then I won’t continue my story. Let me get the correct chit. This is why she is your angel, is it? Tell me what her name is! I don’t know her name. But she had a beautiful mole above her eyebrow. She looks very pretty. Honestly, she is an angel to me. Hello… That's enough! So many stories in Grade 10? How about Grade 12, then? A fatso, who knew nothing in Tamil. Tortured me asking for my Tamil answer sheet. I was happy that a girl was asking for MY paper. I gave it too. I understand you helped, but why did you follow her? She asked the same question too. Why are you following me? I don't know Tamil at all. That’s why I copied from you. If someone sees now what will they think? Hey! No! You don’t know Tamil, I know nothing in English. Tomorrow we have English exam right. If you let me copy, I will come. If you won’t, there is no point turning up. That’s why… Is this why you followed me? Come tomorrow without any worry. I will definitely help you. Mother Promise? You started this Mother Promise trend back then? So! When English is such a big hurdle... ...why did you to come join Law? Grandpa RKR Raja is the reason.

Who are you? Tell me that first. It’s me Sir. RKR Raja. So, what if you are RKR Raja? Are you a big deal? Why are you being rude? Why are you enquiring them is all I want to know. In the name of hunting they are stealing donation boxes. Should I coddle them? Did you see them stealing? Why? Did you see who stole? Only our boys go for hunt, is it? How many people go! Why do you only call our boys and enquire? Do they look like thieves? I will slipper you! How dare... You won’t survive my kick. You old dog! How dare you question me like a lawyer! I will throw you in jail and tear you apart. Leave now! Say all this nonsense in the Court. Sir, sit. Sir, why did you hit him? Hey! Who is he? Is he a Lawyer? How dare he talk to a policeman like that? He can beg and plead. How can he talk back? If we let these “nobody's” talk... ...then petty lawyers will start talking like Judges. Understand? Forgive us, Grandpa! We won’t go for hunts anymore. Not that. We will hit back one day too! Leave that. Don’t tell anyone that I was beaten up. They believe that I can talk on their behalf. If others know this they won't respect our people. Then there won’t be a soul to talk for this village. For you all to study well, get a job and live bravely... ...I will get beaten up how many ever times. Why are you talking like this? What else to do! Even if one of you realises my dream, I will be happy. What now! You want us to study. Right! I will do it. Tell me what to study. LAW! Only then, you can talk for the village proud and loud.

Spelling, right? I will! “pa” “ri” “ye" “rum” “mm” "pe" “ru” I asked you to say it in English. Hey! But I am writing it in Tamil. Why are you so anti-Tamil?

What does your father do? Dad? Dad is… What? Why are you struggling? Do you have a father at all? Yes! He owns a load cart. Is it? Jo keeps saying your name so often. Do you like her so much? Yeah. I do. How much? A lot. Lot meaning?! This much? Or THIS much? Or THISSS much? Lots, Pa. Open your hands and show me how much. Only then I will know, right? Filthy dog! How dare you enter our house?

She is a kid! Will you come, if she asks you to? Who you are... Where you are from... ...we know it all. You both study together. Does that make you equal? What is this? Can you have any kind of relationship with her? From today, you don’t know my daughter! Otherwise they will slit your throat. They will kill you and my daughter too. I beg you! Please don’t talk to my daughter anymore. That is the only good option. You... Don’t come out, immediately. All my relatives are waiting outside. If you come out now, they will chop you up! When the event is over, after everybody goes home... ...runaway quietly. Just the way you came in. Let him step out, I will kill him. Hey Bose Paandi. We shouldn’t let him go. Look, he has come. -Hey! -What now? He must be… Go I said. GO! Let me go. Let me go! We must do something to him. We must kill him. Go, I said. Go! What are you looking at? Leave. Ey, why are you standing here? This is all because of you. Thug! Go! It’s nothing. Leave. Hello! Do you recognise me? Tell me. What happened? Where the hell did you go hurt yourself? Kabadi Tournament in my village. Got hurt there. So, Sir didn’t turn up for the wedding. Because he was busy playing. Right? What arrogance! How many times I insisted that you must come! None of that mattered to you! Now you tell me you were playing? Look up at me! I invited only you in this whole college. To my father, brother, sister... ...I had said so many things about you. We were all expecting you. You know that? Forget all that. How many surprises I had for you! You tell me casually that you were playing a tournament. It’s not like I didn't want to. But I couldn’t come. I beg you! Stop sounding so careless. It didn't occur to you that you ought to come. Don't ever talk about this. You took off for 10 days without even informing! I am telling you now. I will talk to you only when I feel like it. I will also take off without telling you. Bye. Ok! What do you mean? Ok? You have decided to make me cry. Bye! A life breaking down within closed doors A life charred down As the sun comes out A life hunted down By birds that chase A life trampled upon Even on fertile land A life burning down Even when it rains A life pressed down By the happy people A life taken down By the God himself A life that accepts its death WHO? AM I? WHAT... ...AM I? You are light! What might I be? You are rain! What am I then? Oh, WHAT? WHAT? Who am I that trains chase to mow down? Who am I that hangs dead from blossoming trees? Who am I that floats up dead in rivers? Who am I that died burning inside my hut? The God your chariots refuse Who am I? I drink water without touching you Who am I? A village keeps me away with a wall Who am I? I breathe my last in a shithole Who am I? Some say I ruled... Some think I slaved Our hands that ploughed... Are the same that warred! In death, I turn blue Who am I? Bury me. I float in blue sea Who am I? In death, I turn blue Who am I? Bury me and I float in blue sea Who am I? Hey! What is the problem? Why are you sitting here? Only because you asked I am getting you this nonsense. Drink it and tell me what problems you and Jo have. Ok? Hey! What happened to him? Let me ask! You drank, right? Now tell me why you didn't attend the wedding. Bottle is empty! Tell me, why? Nothing happened! You just drank it. It will take some time. Tell me. No! My head has to swirl like a giant wheel. Get me a drink like that. Like a giant wheel? Yes! A drink like that? Soft drink is all he drank. Now he wants more! Son, what is your problem? He got me this. I drank it. Why am I not feeling anything? How will this shit work? Drink this, you will get super high. Look at me. High in heaven! Son! Enough! I want some! Looks like the poor boy is drinking for the first time! Why is he choking on water? Here, the giant wheel you asked for. Ey! No! My head is swirling already. Will you put me in a bus to my village? You are high, is it? Come to class. Give your attendance and then go. No! Not to the College… I am high… Put me in a town bus. Oh, sir is high is it? Don’t go around telling anyone. I will take care of everything. Let's go! Hey! You and Jo have some problem. You are hiding it from me! Mmm… Let me see when you will talk about it. Hey, come here. So... You think what you drank is liquor? Huh? For a drop of liquor. I had mixed a bottle of soft drink. You drink that and act like a hero of pathos! -Soft drink? -Yes! But my head is reeling! I am feeling giddy. If you keep irritating me... ...I will tear open your mouth. Mother Promise bro! Mother Promise?! Or is it because what the guy next to me gave. What! That guy gave you something? Hmmm... And you drank that? Hmmm... Blow, let’s see! [blows] Damn! Cheap liquor. Someone has given you the 60 rupees liquor. Why did you drink that? Why didn’t you tell me this? Hey! How much did he give you? -Anto. -4 or 5? Idiot, will you drink anything anyone gives! ANAND I am right here, Teacher! Pariyerum Perumal…. [mumbles] I am here! Pariyerum Perumal! Teacher, he hasn’t come today. He hasn’t? Kalaivaanan Yes, Madam. Saravanan I have told her you are absent! Please stay down. If you get up, I will get caught. [mumbles] What did you say? I told her you are absent. Just lie down! Sankaralingam Why did you say that? Ey! Don’t irritate me. Just lie down like that. Why, shouldn’t I come? He is here Madam. Is it wrong if I do? I am here! You tell me, bro. Is it wrong, if I come? What is that noise there? Nothing teacher! Pariyerum Perumal! Hey! He said you didn’t come! Why! Is it wrong if I come? Why is he talking like this? He is drunk, Madam. -I must ask this! -Are you drunk? Please someone answer... Shouldn't I come? Take him out! They are saying it is wrong for me to come. They are saying that! Hey! Who said that? I am telling you now! You can be anywhere, anytime. Come! Right away, Teacher! Get out of the class. Get out! Shouldn't I go there? Get out, I said! Teacher, why are you screaming? I am taking him out! IS IT WRONG FOR ME TO GO THERE? How much ever you scream no one will understand you. Don't shout Teacher! I will break your head open. -Good Jo didn't come today. -That's why he is doing this. He said he will become Dr. Ambedkar Did you say that? What is the complaint against you? I am asking you! He came drunk to class sir. He came drunk to class. Did you come drunk? Out! I want to meet his father tomorrow. I will tell him, sir. Who is that? I don’t know. -Go see! -Let me go. This old man looks interesting. Should we take him? Who do you want to meet? We want to meet Sivaji Sankar Sir! For the college? To act? Yes Sir! -Hey, Sivaji. -Ya! See you have a booking! Come take your advance. Yes, coming! Advance? Looks like they are going to fleece us. You suggested this right! Pay up. Here comes the King of acting! Which college? Law College. -Law College? -Yes. Son, I can’t do it. They ask tricky questions. No! They won't, Sir. He came drunk to class. That’s the problem. If you come... ...they will yell at him in front of you. That's all. Look here, mason! The shame that drunkards like we, have to carry. Exactly Sir! Son! If you had called me for love or fight, I wouldn't have come. Because it is about drinking, I am going with you. Two bottles of alcohol is the fee. Is that ok? Two bottles? For one person? The head mason is sending me with you! So? I have to give him a bottle. Isn’t it the rule of drinking? Two bottles for us to be on-board! If not walk on. -Sir, I will get you two bottles. -Ok! I will put on my shirt! Come soon. Son! You never mentioned your father’s name to me. Selvaraj From Puliyankulam village. Oh! Selvaraj. What does he do? He owns a load cart. What kind of a person is he? Is he an angry man? Or an innocent one? Or is he a cheapskate? Also, does he beat you up? Only if you give this information I can act, right? Dad… ...is a very angry man. If he knows that I have done something wrong, that’s it! He will beat me to pulp. He looks very majestic. Like the character from Thanga Pathakkam. This is enough. Wait and watch my performance! Sit please! Are you his father? Yes, Sir! What do you do? I own load carts. Did he tell you anything? No sir. He said you sent for me. How will he say anything? He has come drunk to the class. What is it, Sir? He has come to the College drunk. Liquor! Liquor! Hey... Hey... Stop. Don’t beat him. Is this how you beat up a boy this age? What kind of a father are you? Who? Who told you I am his dad? He is not my son. From the moment his tongue touched liquor... ...he has ceased to be my son. He is an orphan now. We have nothing to do with each other anymore. I don’t even tolerate the word “liquor”. How could he be my son? No way, Sir. Why are you hitting him so hard? Sir! Do me a favour. Throw him out of the institution now. Wait... You can even burn him. Burn him! I don’t have any problem. Don’t ever send for me again. Sir... Come here for a minute. Let’s talk. What is there to talk? I should just hang myself for having a son like this. Let me hang myself. Let me! Just, let me. So much rage! A son like you for a father like that. I forgive you because of his anger. Go. Sign the apology letter. What's up? Did I beat him up badly? Why is he sulking? Nothing like that. Don’t mistake me. Only if you exaggerate they will quit bothering you. That’s why. See! Doesn’t it feel wonderful to hear? That’s our greatness! Why are you pouring only two glasses? Anna... He will never drink after this. The whole problem was because he drank right? That is his first... ...and will be his last time to touch liquor. Let us drink. Here! That’s why he got scared. Yes! Anna Cheers! CHEERS! Listen, Pariya... ...I forgot to tell you something. After I finished my performance... ...a girl pleaded with me for you. Her name is a… single syllable… -Single syllable? -Yes! JO? Yes! I thought so. Jo? Ya! What did she say? Pa! Pa! You are Pariyan’s dad, right? Yes. I am Jo, pa. Pariyan’s friend. So? Pa, Pariyan wouldn’t have done anything wrong. Someone has wrongly accused him. Please pa. Don’t beat him. Pa. I take your word. I will take care. I promise on my god Sudalai. She had tears filled in her eyes when she spoke. I think... ...she likes you a lot. Get up and go. Why did he get so tensed? So it is love, is it? He is going somewhere. Go with him. Let him go! I always hang out with them. I still don’t understand. If I ask him, he yells at me. She just breaks down and weeps. What can I do? Why are you sitting on my bench? Get up and go back. Why argue over a bench? There are so many seats empty. Go sit there. Should I obey you? Get up and go back. Why are you ordering me around? Is your name written on this bench? Hey! Yes, it is written! Look! Sword KSL Now go! I won’t go. If you need to, go sit at the back. You won’t get up? NO! When you were caught alone that day... ...I should have just slit your throat. I sympathised and let you go. That's why you are arrogant. What did you say? Why, couldn’t you hear? They shut you up in a room and peed on your face right? I was talking about that. Get up, will you? Or should I also pee on you? Lingu, stop this! You are doing unnecessary things now. Who are you to send me back? Why should I go back? I will be in the front from now on. How dare you touch him! I will kick you! Why are you beating him? Why are you doing this? Move the hell away! You are always doing this. I would have to get involved then. Won't you listen to me? Move along! Bro… Let’s complain to the Principal. Why the hell should I complain? What happens to my pride then? I know... ...what to do with him. I will take care of it. What happened to you? What do you mean? Why did you beat him up? I am asking YOU! Isn’t he your caste too? Go ask him. My caste?! I will break open your head. Do I care what caste you belong to? Tell me why you beat him up? I will beat him up too. Why are you losing your energy over him? Why would he tell us anything? He has become a big man! Big thug! That’s why he is doing all this. How would he tell us anything! You didn’t answer me right. She is asking you now, answer her. Bro, there is no need to tell everybody everything. Who are you referring to? She is going. Let her go. Go, you idiot! JO! JO! Who is it whistling in the middle of nowhere? Will you stop the bus or should I jump out? Give way. Step down for a second. Take him! Who are you? Look, look. He is running away. Hey, my chain is missing. Go, look for it. Where did you drop it? Don't let him go. Why did you let him enter the village? [song Poraadada By Ilaiyaraaja] So many thrashings you threw on our backs! You will receive it in leaps and bounds That is our pay-back! We are the people of "Nandhan" We will take over your throne That day Is not far away! We are the people of "Nandhan" We will take over your throne That day Is not far away! Our cry of victory will be heard Our light will fill up this world! We the proletarians will fight back Hello Lawyer, coming from this side? Do the waves ever tire! What? They hit you? Why didn't you tell me earlier, idiot! Which village are they from? I don’t know. They got in from the west. Why did they beat you up? I got into a fight in College. Maybe he sent these guys. Where is he from? Near Ambasamudram. Ambasamudram? Then he must have sent these people to threaten you. Aren’t some of our boys studying with you? Yeah, yeah... Many, actually. Then, you take their support. If they refuse... ...I will get some people from here. No! I will take care of it. Son… Son… Come here. Grandpa! Are you going to college? Yes. What are you doing here? I came till Siruvaikundam. Are you from here? Yes. Puliankulam. -I thought you were from Siruvaikundam. -No! -Puliyankulam boy is it! -Yes! Ok! Why are you getting up? I have been sitting for too long... ...my knees hurt. -You sit. -Ok! Sending henchmen... They have become that audacious. We shouldn’t let this go. We should make them run for their lives. Just show me who they are. I will take care of the rest. What? Hmmm...Okay. Hey, Pariya! Aren't you coming to the class? Hey! Go on now! He will come. I wasn’t talking to you. Bro! You go ahead I will come. I have my doubts about this guy. Bro, don’t say that. He is my good friend. Ok, I will leave. Where are you going? We are all sitting here for you. You are running away. No Bro. I don’t remember who exactly it was. I will tell you when I remember. Ok? Ok! Take care. Looks like he is scared! Hey! He is from Puliyankulam. Don’t under-estimate him. Wait and watch. He might stand alone and fight. -Pariyan. -Tell me now bro! Should I put an atom bomb or a knife? Put a rock on my head. -Did you come running to write this? -Yes! Hey! Move it. Pariya! How come you are sitting on the second bench? I will be ahead from now on! All that’s fine. Why do I hear so many complaints about you? What happened to you? You were very well-behaved. OK! Come to the staff room after class. I need to talk to you. Ok? Sit now. What’s up? PARIYERUM PERUMAL BABL with a line on top. Nowhere to be seen? Nothing like that, Teacher. Nothing is it? You come drunk to class! That was meant for fun... Turned out like this. Sorry. Why do I need your sorry? It’s ok, just keep it. Enough of this sarcasm. What is the problem between you and her? I don’t see you both together at all. Nothing like that! Aren't we sitting together now? Hello! Are you kidding me? Be careful. You went to a kabadi match instead of her sister's wedding? Why are you glaring at her? I didn’t hear about it from her. Out of all of us, she invited only you. That’s why I am asking. That’s what I want to know too. Why was I alone invited? She must have thought you are enough. That’s what. Why only me? Hey! Are you dumb? Don’t you understand that she loves you? Why... ...don’t you like Jo? Teacher! She is MY Jo! What is your problem then? You pretend like you are ignorant of her love. Why? Should this only mean romantic love? Can’t she be my good friend? Can’t she be my dead dog Karuppi? Ok, leave all this aside. Can’t she be the tiny ray of hope that remains for me! Does it mean you don’t love her? After all that I said, if you can’t understand it... ...no one here will understand. Let it go. Hey! Have you gone mad? YES SIR! I have gone mad. What happened to you? You are behaving oddly. They have sent for your dad again. Where will I go look for that actor? You don’t have to go in search of anyone. I will bring my own father. Your dad? You didn't want to bring him! I want to now! I want my father. I will bring him. Really! Really.

That’s why. To the College? Why take me there? Take your mother, Son. They sent for the father. You come with me. -What is this? -Come, Pa. My dad! We want to meet the principal. Dad? Let me ask him. They want to meet your dad first. Dad… ...you go in first. I will wait here. Son… ...I can talk without fear right? That’s how you must talk. -Go. -Alright. Have you enquired all the students? Yes, sir. Take care. Hello Sir! Hello! Sir, who are you? I am Pariyerum Perumal’s father. Pariyerum Perumal’s father! Just last week, another man came and beat him up. Who is he then? Sir, I don female roles and dance. He must have felt ashamed to say this and brought someone else. Is that wrong? He commits bigger mistakes than this. Can I tear his admission slip? Sir, you tear what you have to. Whatever it is... ...just have a word with him before you do. Sir... ...he is not going to get what we say. That’s why... ...he has changed his father. Let us call him and enquire. Ok Sir! You can leave. We will talk to your son. Is this why you called me all the way here? I was worried. Alright! I will leave then. I will ask my son to come. What happened, Pa? They got scared of me. They want you to come. Ok. You go. Anand is waiting out. You be with him. -Sir! -Come in. Pariyerum Perumal BABL with a line on top. What are you looking at? I have told everything about you. Is this your father? Yes, Sir. You have such an innocent dad. Why did you bring someone else then? Why are you asking him all that? Just suspend him. Gopal Sir... ...wait outside for sometime. Do you know something? My father mends shoes on the road. I am his son. Your Principal! Never! Ever... ...change your father. We know you didn’t enter the women’s toilet. We also know who pushed you in. I knew too! They chased me around like a pig. Did I run and hide? I understood what was important and studied like a maniac. Those who wanted to silence me then... ...are folding their hands in respect now. I say this after meeting your father. In spite of everything happening around you... ...you will win one day. Just like I did! Bear this in mind, and do whatever you want to. Go! Go! Go! Why are you saying this to him? He is going to pick up a fight now. Let him! At least he won’t hang himself. Let him die fighting! You think we can change those guys? -We can’t sir. -Then? Why are you silencing this guy? Hey! Who is that sitting there like a eunuch? Don’t you know? He is Pariyan's real father. Father? Daddy? Are you serious? Ya… Don't you know? A eunuch father! And still has so much pride eh? Dei, where are you guys going? Hey folks where are you going? We will just take a look and come. Picking up a fight eh? They will pick up a brawl with Pariyan! By the way, where is he? Saw his bun? Oye! Who are you? Why are you sitting here? I am… Pariyan’s dad. -What happened? -No problem. It’s all done. Where is dad? Why are you asking me? Didn’t he come with you? Bro! I sent him because you were here. I went to take a leak. Why did you leave him alone? I am Pariyan’s father, truly. Yeah, yeah! Let’s see if you are the father or mother. Don’t touch me. Show me. Don’t touch me. Let me go. Leave me. Lift this. Let go off my dhoti. Raising your hand. Leave me. Raising your hand is it… Show me. Why are you getting worked up? He must be standing here somewhere. Hey! Look! I beg you! APPAAAA Dai! Let him go! DAI! What happened in college yesterday? Nothing. Nothing happened is it? Nothing is it? Nothing? You idiot! Don’t you have any sense? Wait! How many times to tell you! Why are you beating him? What do you mean why? He is creating unnecessary problems. Idiot! What do you mean? That boy who came for the wedding, remember? We chased him away, right? After that, he didn’t come in our way. He keeps picking up fights with him. If he picks up a fight, you will hit our boy, is it? What do you want me to do? He didn’t just stop with him. Yesterday, his father had come to college. He removed his dhoti, shamed him and made him run naked. What did you do? Why are you asking him? Ask me! My daughter says "They beat up his father". "Come let’s go visit him". He is going to make her do things that she doesn't want to do. She knows everything. She is just pretending. Nonsense! She told me clearly. "Sankaralingam has mistaken that boy and is picking a fight with him every day". She cried. She cried? Huh! Why did she cry? Why did she cry? She thinks the world of him! That’s why she cried! Do you all know something? Do you? She follows him like a dog. Like a dog! Someday... ...she is going to take him and elope. That day all your pride will go down the drain. We all just have to hang ourselves. Then you will know if I was right or wrong. Wait! Sit. I said sit! Sit, let’s talk. Hey! Come. Uncle’s calling you, right? Come. Sit. Hey! What is this you are talking about? That boy is keeping away from her. She is following him like a mad woman. Today she is saying she wants to go see his father. I have a feeling we are going to lose her. Is that why she cried so much? She has ruined us! What do we do now? Let’s finish him off. Hey! What if we do something in haste and it goes wrong? What will go wrong? Nothing will. We have someone who will do this secretly. Who is it? Maistry Nittam’s grandson. Your dad is unwell. That’s why we are shaving your head. Don’t cry. Is this the street? Yes. Turn at the end of the street. Uncle! We can trust that old man right? Hey! If he misses his target, he will end his own life. She won’t go with that guy anymore, right? No she won’t. I shaved her head. So don’t be scared. Hey! Big man! So long huh? Are you good? I am good. You? My trowels and squares are taking care of me, just fine. Then? After a long time… Tell me! We need to kill a rooster. -Rooster? -Yes. -Whose hen is it? -Ours. -This is my nephew. -Hello! He has come for his sister. Where is the boy from? From the east. You have to finish the task at the right time. My pal has come. Won't I do it for him? Brother... ...do it as early as you can. Please! Why? The hen is refusing to stay home, is it? Do you have his picture? This is him. Him? What is his name? Pariyerum Perumal I know him. He is studying in Law College, right? Exactly! Hey! He is a good boy. Should I have a word with him? We tried all that. We even beat him up. He isn’t budging. Brother! Let’s finish him off. Ok! Please accept this. Hey, put it back. Keep it with you. I murder for the honor of our women. It is my offering to god! In case something goes wrong... ...and I end up in jail... ...use this to take me out. Ok? Now keep this. We will take care of all that. No one should know. We trust you! We will do it smoothly. Where is the rooster? In the hospital! Hey! What are you doing? What is this? Where did you get this from? Give it to me. Why? Ma, please... Give it to me. They made him run. They made him run naked in front of my eyes. Give it to me. I want to tear at least one of them apart. Give! What are you saying? Who taught you all this? Is this the first time your father is facing this? How many times... ...he had been mistaken for a woman and kidnapped. They would remove his skirt. When they realise he is a man... ...they would leave him naked and run away. I wasn’t there for him then. You weren’t there then. Now, you are all we have! Don’t leave us alone. You don’t have to go to college anymore. Ok? Just be with us. No, Ma! I have to go to college. I have to study. Why are you in such a hurry? Pariya... ...semester results are out it seems. You have passed both the English papers. Who told you this? Jo! -Congrats, darling! -She is waiting downstairs. It's so sad to see her. Go talk to her. Go. Talk to her. Just go. Thanks a lot. Thanks? Have we become that distant? Hey, sorry. I didn’t mean it like that! I passed English exams only because of you. That’s why I thanked you. I really don’t know why he is behaving like this! That’s why I spoke to my dad. Dad beat him up nicely. He will not disturb you anymore. I shouldn’t have invited you alone for my sister’s wedding. So many people... ...must have troubled you with so many questions! Couldn't you have told me what you told them? That you didn’t like to come for the wedding. I thought you would believe a lie easily than the truth. This is a lie. I like the truth more than a lie. Today, I have to tell you a truth. Hey, why are you closing your eyes now? Wait, wait! Jo! Please let me speak. Ok! I don’t have the courage to say this to your face. So, I will speak with my eyes closed. You listen to it quietly. Ok. Go on! I told my dad, mom, brother how much I like you. I don’t know what they feel. But I feel… ...that I should be with you. That I should come and live with your family. I shouldn’t be thinking all this about you, without your permission. I know. But I should tell you this someday, right? That’s why I told you today, with my eyes shut. You don’t have to respond to any of this. I only want to go back to being the way we were. The first time I saw you... ...sitting in the last bench... ...introducing yourself as Pariyerum Perumal BABL with a line on top. Will you be that Pariyan? Only then I will open my eyes. Ok! Open your eyes, first. Mother promise? -Open your eyes, Jo. -Promise I said. Mother Promise! When I turn to look at you in the last bench... ...I want to see you smiling. Will you? Ok. Open your eyes. Ok! I am going to open my eyes now. Smile for me. Can I? What happened? Listen, you can ask me anything. Can tell me anything. You have all the right and freedom for that. You just said we could go back to our old selves, right? That’s enough! That’s superb! I am not confused anymore. You? Neither am I. I am ok! See... Happy! Super, Jo. I have even brought you a chocolate. Chocolate? What? Here... Why? Hey idiot! For clearing your English papers. Right! You speak so much but can’t open a wrapper. Give. Here, take it. I got through because of you. So you go first! Shall I leave then? Yes! It's late. Dad? He is good. Grandpa... ...what happened to your leg? Nothing. I was having tea at the shop. An idiot on a bike hit me! My bone is broken, I am unable to walk. Should I call an auto? I have my cycle. Do me a favor? My house is in Shanthi Nagar. Will you come drop me? Alright! Careful! GRANDPA! GRANDPA! NO! Aren’t you dead yet? I am finishing you off today! Don’t let him go. Lingu, hold him down. Beat him to death! You are a loafer. You want our girl, is it? Arrogant ass! Welcome, Sir! Welcome! Have you come to see if I am dead? Are you even human? I came to your house because she invited me. You lock me up, beat me, urinate on me! Hasn't your rage settled down? You have sent an old man to kill me! Is this your valor? Hey, remember how your daughter smiled at you today! How fondly she called you "dad"! That affection is the pittance I doled out to you. You think you are the protectors of your pride, honour and shit like that! I have protected it! Had I told your daughter all this... ...she would have spat on your face and hung herself. That’s why I put up with everything. What now? If you think only in my death you will be the father... ...she believes you are! Come. Kill me! COME! KILL ME! After killing me... ...if you still don’t trust your daughter, go kill her too! What is your problem? How am I inferior to you? I tell you now… My hands held the plough, but it also wielded swords! That’s exactly why I will stay right here! I will study what I like! Do what you can! Leave! Old man commits suicide jumping in front of train in Tirunelveli -Hello, Son. -Hello Sir! -Sit. -How many times I called you home! You didn’t turn up. So, dad decided to come see you. Are you well? Yes! Why is your face wounded? Pa! Sir is a kabadi player. Keeps getting hurt like this. Oh! She keeps talking about you at home. That’s why I thought I should meet you. Looks like you have cleared your English papers? Yes Sir. Jo trained me! Nice! It's nice to help each other, right? She has taught you what she knows. You do the same too. What say, Jo? Also, she complains that Sankaralingam keeps troubling you. He is my brother’s son. He must be doing this out of love for his sister. Don’t mind! Ok? Shake hands with him! Do it! Don’t mind. Ok! You be in the car, I will come now. Pa, you both talk. I will get something to eat. Pa, tea or coffee? Anything. You? I know. Son, I am going to ask you something. Answer me frankly. Yes sir! We did all that to you. Why didn’t you talk about it to my daughter? Do you know something? Your daughter likes you more than me. "Nobody has a father as good as mine" she says. That’s why! Thanks! I know… ...my daughter likes you as much as she likes me. I also know that she wants to be with you. Son, my daughter is so obsessed with you. Don’t you feel the same about her? I don’t know. Before I could understand it, you tore me to pieces. But your daughter is very lucky. She can say what she feels openly, anywhere. Look at me. I have to die so many times, before I can say what I feel. Sorry! You are a good person. You will become all that you wish to be. Study well. Ok? I can only say this for now. What else can I say? Let’s see. Things can change tomorrow, right? Who knows! I know Sir! As long as you are the way you are... ...and expect me to be the dog, you want me to be. Nothing will change! Everything will stay the same! Come Let’s run around like little trains Are you still upset with me? Forgive me, let’s go on. Why do you stand aside and look at me? Let’s hold hands and walk away Like we used to You are my favorite Am I your team or not? Tell me if you will come along I promise you, I will Come Let’s run around like little trains Are you still upset with me? Forgive me, let’s go on. I am here all alone Do you know why so?
