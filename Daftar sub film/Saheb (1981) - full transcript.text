Three cheers for Saheb! Hip.. hip hurray! Only two more points are needed. If we could even draw the rest two matches.. ..then we'll play in the first division next year for sure. Packed ground. Saheb. Saheb, you are our only hope. If your same form remains in the rest two matches.. If you don't let any ball go into the net.. ..then no fool will be able to stop us from.. ..a packed ground first division game! 'No, Kamol.' Saheb will not play in the rest two matches. Saheb.. will not play? - Why, Dr. Banerjee? You'll make me sit in these two vital matches? - Yes. 'Why?' - If you get hurt, what will happen then? No, Dr. Banerjee, I completely agree with you. It won't be right for us to take any risk. 'Whether the club loses or wins, it does not matter.' - 'Yes!' 'Yes.' The opportunity to play in a packed ground.. ..is now in your hands, Saheb. Next week is university selection trial. They have called you! I'm 90 percent sure that you will get the chance. But to turn this ninety percent into hundred percent.. ..is your responsibility. This is the question of the reputation of our club. Personally it is the question of my reputation. So now onward, practice.. practice.. practice, practice all the time! "I won't leave even one cup, one shield or even a medal." "I will never lose in any game in this life." "I will never lose in any game in this life." "I won't leave even one cup, one shield or even a medal." "I will never lose in any game in this life." "I will never lose in any game in this life." "Hip.. hip hurray.. hip.. hip hurray." "Hip.. hip hurray.. hip.. hip hurray." "Hip.. hip hurray!" "I'll explain that the fight is wearing jersey, boots on feet." "I'll explain that the fight is wearing jersey, boots on feet." "I won't let the ball enter the goalpost." "I will never get lost in defeat anymore." "I will never lose in any game in this life." "I will never lose in any game in this life." "I won't leave even one cup, one shield or even a medal." "I will never lose in any game in this life." "I will never lose in any game in this life." "Hip.. hip hurray.. hip.. hip hurray." "Hip.. hip hurray.. hip.. hip hurray." "Hip.. hip hurray!" Hey, why didn't come for practice today? Oh no, I'm very upset. - 'Why so?' I heard result is going to be declared tomorrow. Got over. - 'What got over?' Tomorrow is my university trial match. My chance of playing is doomed. - Why? Why? Exam result. Your second time. And my, third and the last chance. And if I don't pass, father will expel me from the house. If I could anyhow find a job.. - Job? Why should you worry? - Yes. You're getting a chance in the university team. Shombhuda has said he'll get you into the railways. Otherwise through our club president.. ..Dr. Banerjee somewhere.. - Stop.. stop. Neither the seed will germinate.. ..nor the plant will grow. - No, man.. no. You will certainly find something, you see. Perhaps you'll get some offer from a first division club. Then job, money.. - Scooter, T.V., fridge, keep saying.. ..keep saying. - Ticket.. ticket. Give those.. give those to me. Ganga's mother didn't come to work today, I suppose? She does her work. Her work is to do the dishes twice daily. Call me from tomorrow. When I go to the market, do you stay at home at that time? To be more precise, can you tell me.. ..how much time you are found at home? Football. Football. I'll come from the dispensary. - No. Sister-in-law has said. - I'm saying no. Nothing happened to me. - Didn't happen but could happen. It shouldn't happen that's why sister-in-law has said. 'Daughter-in-law.' What is this injustice, no disease but you are taking medicine? High blood pressure, taking medicine.. ..regularly is good, father-in-law. You are not getting good sleep at night these days. Feel somewhat tired all the time. Isn't it better to stay careful? Nothing escapes your eyes I see. 'Father. Market bag?' Oh, dutiful son has relieved father from the load. So much concern for father. But Saheb sincerely respects you, father. 'Stop, daughter-in-law.' You don't advocate for Saheb anymore. Respect, huh. What's this, daughter-in-law? For saving the household expenditure you.. ..did away with the cook. And took the responsibility of the kitchen on yourself. I kept watching everything with my mouth shut! But is it your job to deliver tea to all the rooms? So what, father? A daughter-in-law does this in every household. There are two more people other than you.. ..in this household, daughter-in-law. Why don't I see them? You know it, father, Madhobi has diphtheria. Her heart beats heavily after working hard. And Gopa, does she have time, tell me? She has to go to the office. Waking up early morning, finish bathing.. ..eating and has to get ready by 9 o' clock. Stop.. stop, you don't need to explain anymore! Bulti! Hey Bulti! What, father? You don't have any brains or concern?! You all will keep sleeping, leaving all the responsibilities.. ..of such a big household on one person?! Isn't it right for you to help the daughter-in-law? You are scolding Bulti for no reason, father. She does half of my work. Recently I asked her not to come into kitchen. - Why? She has to be married soon. If any incident happens with her with kitchen fire.. The way the girl is behaving for some days. Why, what happened? - What else will happen? Exam result is coming out, the girl has lost appetite and sleep. Oh. When is result coming out? - I heard tomorrow. Tomorrow. Daughter-in-law, Bulti lost appetite and sleep because of the tension. But the other one, who failed twice and.. ..appeared in exams with his younger sister? But he is unconcerned. Football.. football. Saheb will certainly pass this year, father, you watch. If your words come true, daughter-in-law.. ..I'll be the happiest.. But remember one thing, if he fails this time again.. ..then I will throw him out of the house! If he sit idle, eat on elder brothers earnings and.. ..keeps playing football, I won't tolerate it! 'Saheb.' - What? Have to go to Mr. Romoni's house for once. Right now. Tell him, to get this petition signed by his mother.. And send it to me in the court by 12 noon. - Yes. I have to file it today. And should also bring along fifty rupees. Hold this. - Give, give it here. What a thing God has made. What to do, you can see both my hands are engaged? May I have a glass of water, Mr. Nibaron? - Hey. Hey! What? - Bring a glass of water. Sister-in-law, vegetables. Here is father's medicine. Hey sister, give up your incessant chatter and.. ..pay a little attention on household work. Chop some vegetables and do a favour on the cutter. You mind your own business! - There's no time, sister. Minding the business of you five, my time gets over. 'Hey Chotda!' - My goodness, why are you threatening me? You just came from practice. Drinking water without eating anything? I'm not drinking, I'm taking it. Your respected middle brother's client will gulp. Sorry, will drink. But, hey sister, may I know what's wrong with you? Tea got cold. Biscuit is half eaten. Why, sister. I don't like anything. Who knows what's in fate tomorrow. Come on, you'll pass for sure! - Rather I.. Hey Chotda! - What? You are hopeless! - Why? Eating my half eaten biscuit! My goodness, some crow or a stray dog would have eaten.. But I ate so.. You.. you, you are hopeless. 'Saheb!' - Coming! You gave the petition? - Here's water. I'll give. 'Saheb!' - Coming! - What's this! - Hey! Got completely wet. - No.. no, all right.. all right. Means.. Okay.. okay.. okay.. okay. - If you could do anything properly. First deliver the paper then do your other work. Saheb! - 'Coming!' I'm shouting since so long, can't you hear? Go, bring a blade. You better give money for a whole packet, Borda. Will last long. - I know. But that costs more. You don't earn or else you'd have understood. Go, be fast, I'm getting late for office. Go. Hey, where are you going there? - 'Saheb!' Coming, middle sister-in-law. Saheb! - What? Don't you have any brains at all? I'm also saying the same? Don't you have any brains at all, middle sister-in-law? Chintu is studying. And you've put on the radio, wow! I'm not studying, junior uncle, I'm doing math. Oh, doing math is not studying I suppose? 'Stop.. stop!' At least you don't talk about studies. First look at yourself. No matter how much you sting, middle sister-in-law.. ..this is a rhinoceros skin. I know I'm a complete duffer in studies. But if Chintu becomes something.. I'll become goalkeeper when I grow up, junior uncle! I will save penalty like you! - 'Shut up, hopeless!' I will become goalkeeper! Do what you are doing! Do you have elder brothers, that you'll sit idle.. ..eat on them and keep playing football?! Will you be kind to bring a box of tobacco? After having tea I couldn't even take a betel leaf. I'm getting such a headache.. Listen! Come quickly. Don't get stuck with friends. 'Saheb!' 'Saheb!' Saheb! - 'Coming, Sejda!' Order, master? - Do something quickly. What? - Bring my clothes from the laundry. 1 rupee 25.. Take.. - Wow.. wow.. wow.. wow. You do nice ironing, Sejda. I try so hard, couldn't do anyhow. What work could you do properly?! - Ha. Take this. Go. And listen.. listen.. listen. - What? Your sister-in-law was saying something you know. - What? She was saying.. something.. that.. mm.. Gopa. Gopa. 'Hey Gopa.' What happened? Oh, Saheb? Will you do something for me, brother? - 'Say.' Please, don't mind okay? That cobbler who sits at the square.. Hey dear, give Saheb. 'The strap is torn, brother. Will you get it stitched?' Come back soon or else I'll get late for office. Weird, on no! Is this tea?! - 'Give.' What? - Wow, won't it need money to repair this? You don't have even ten or fifteen paisa? How could I have? Do I do job, or do I steal? Stop.. stop. No work but so much talk. Return the balance paisa. - I'll remember. Incredible. Hurry up, man. What's happening? It's so late. 'Hey aunt!' Hey aunt! Aunt! - 'What happened?' You are impossible! These heavy bags.. Come on.. come on, hold this.. - No, I can do it. Ah, listen to what I say! Come on, hold this. Come. Why you went to bring ration, Bishu can't go? Bishu has got a job. - Really? Yes. - Where? There, at a jute mill in Kashipur. - Very good. Very good! What's there in my fate.. - No, dear. The job is just namesake. - What? Actually.. Don't tell anyone, son. - No.. no. It's job of coolie in jute mill. - So what? Will toil and earn so what's the harm? Here, you've to come with these heavy bags.. Okay, aunt, someday I'll go and eat a hearty meal at your place. Fried lentils. Opium potato and fish with gravy. You came down for this, father-in-law? Couldn't you've called me? Everyone at home is calling you since morning. Let at least me be an exception. Up and down the stairs so many times.. ..will not be good for you, father-in-law. Will not be good, that my body tells me sometimes. But alone in the room upstairs, all worries come to my head. I feel suffocated. Why are you so worried, father-in-law? Why worried? Bulti. Call Saheb for once. - Chotda is not at home, father. He has gone out, will come shortly. All the time just football and friends! This has happened due to your encouragement, daughter-in-law. Couldn't see his shadow at home for a moment. You are getting angry in vain, father-in-law. All the people at home ordered him so many things. Do we people let him stay at home? You get blisters on saying anything about Saheb. Give me tea. - First, eat this. Bulti. - I will eat with you. Ah, listen to what I say. Not eating till late afternoon.. won't you feel weak? You don't feel weak I guess? - Don't argue. Yes, don't argue, don't argue at all. Hunger, thirst, rest is only for you, for me. For everyone else at home but for her? What's this, daughter-in-law? You didn't put potato pieces in the vegetable? You rather take the vegetable and give me some jaggery. No, father-in-law, you won't get any of potato or jaggery. Get the blood sugar checked, let the report come. Then rather I'll put a spoon of sugar in your tea. All your discipline is on me. - Wrong said, father-in-law. I have three naughty children. One is you, another is this girl, and the third.. Chintu, your mother's tobacco. Younger uncle, shall I take a little tobacco? - I'll slap you! Borda, blade. Sister-in-law, sandal. Sejda, shirt pant. Oh sorry. Five paisa return. I remembered to return, you remember it. Did you see, did you see his daring? He has become uncontrollable because of Bordi's pampering! Sister-in-law! Hey sister-in-law, I've to go out! Today is the day of bringing ration. Bulti, show me the cards. Daughter-in-law, this week oil is available in ration. Give him a vessel. Sister-in-law, if I bring the ration tomorrow? May I know what royal work you're going for? Royal work means, have to go to cremation ground, father. What happened? - There, twenty seven by one. Mr. Aghor. - What are you saying, Aghor?! Yesterday I saw him in market? We talked so much and overnight.. What happened to him? - Heart attack. I had high blood pressure. I'll leave, sister-in-law. - Wait. I promised them, I'll go, sister-in-law. Let him go, daughter-in-law. Shouldn't stop from such works. Going to cremation with empty stomach.. ..is not good, father-in-law. Hey, sit, eat something then go. A lively man.. is finished. For a few years he was in much trouble. I was so worried. - What are you saying? Aghor was worried? He had two houses in Kolkata. Three worthy sons, all of them earning. And I heard he had lot of money in the bank as well. That's why there is trouble. The sons and daughters-in-law used to create.. ..a problem everyday about money and property. And he was an introverted man, used to suffer within himself. What a world. I don't have, so I'm worried. One who has is also worried. That's why I say, father-in-law, don't worry in vain. What is supposed to happen will happen. I understand, daughter-in-law, but my mind.. ..is not in my control. Sister-in-law. Father-in-law. Take the medicine, father-in-law. I'll take, I'll certainly take. I too have high blood pressure. But I'll have to keep alive for some more days. Otherwise.. blunder. What's this, why are you gobbling like this? Two minutes will not make any difference. - 'Saheb!' You eat, I'll ask them to wait. Bulti. - What, father? No. Daughter-in-law, listen to me. Well we can say Bulti is fair? - Certainly. Rather even if his name is Saheb (Englishman).. ..but Saheb couldn't be called fair. So we could say she is fair complexioned? And tomorrow her result will come out, will certainly pass. So could also say educated girl, graduate? Here's an alliance for a doctor, daughter-in-law. Fair complexioned, educated, simple looking girl. No specific demands. Early marriage. Everyone says so, father-in-law. But go and see, jewellery, bed, cupboard, sofa set.. These days they even demand radio, fridge, T.V. This Mr. Aghor himself, demanded.. ..a fiat car in his youngest son's marriage. Father, I'm leaving okay? Sister-in-law, I'm leaving! 'Come back early!' - 'Yes.' Hello? You hold for a while, I'll call. Father. Phone for you. - Oh. Well in the newspaper today.. Yes the girl is my daughter. My name is Biprodas Mukhopadhay. Biprodas Mukhopadhay. I used to work for Mohon Atkinson. I retired a few years back. But how you.. - How I know? I used to come to your Mohon Atkinson every year for audit. Remember? - Oh, Mr. Banerjee. Look at the fun. Hey, greetings.. greetings. No, this connection is certainly God's intention. Otherwise why after such a long time with you.. You know, Mr. Banerjee.. No.. no, Mr. Biprodas, don't say that. Making relation with a noble man like you.. ..is really a fortunate thing for me. Listen, remember one thing. Whatever money we had has been spent for.. ..building this house. You don't commit anything. First ask to show the girl. If we like her then I'll say whatever is to be said. Hello, Mr. Biprodas.. - And listen. The girl should at least be graduate. Yes. - Pardon? Yes.. yes, you can consider her a graduate. I heard the result will come out tomorrow. My daughter will certainly pass. Pardon? Hello? Yes? That.. that matter.. What.. what are you saying? I'm saying that let the result come out tomorrow. Let the girl pass first, we'll talk day after tomorrow. Tell him. Oh. Yes, Mr. Biprodas, means I was saying.. ..well.. that I mean.. well.. Daughter-in-law. Daugh.. Oh. I did something without telling you. What, father-in-law? - You are busy now, I'll tell later. Saheb is not at home, I'll take Chintu to school? No, father-in-law, I'll take him and bring back. No.. no that's not done, daughter-in-law. Of course it's done, father-in-law. I won't let you go out again in this scorching sun. You dictate very much, daughter-in-law dictate.. ..very much. - Father-in-law, Gopa is unable to eat. She'll get late for office. - Oh ho. Hey Bulti! What happened? - The fish feels strange. 'Eat and see.' Check yours. Weird. - I didn't feel anything while cooking. Your brother also ate the same. - You cooked.. ..so brother ate and went without saying anything! If anyone else had cooked.. No, brother-in-law, don't get up without finishing. Bulti, bring some milk. - Milk rice?! Rather get some curd, what say? - That's better. Saheb.. Saheb! - Junior uncle is not at home. Junior uncle is not at home? - No. - Oh. We'll give so much money every month.. ..and we have to go to the office without eating! Bulti, check if the fish is really bad? - Let me see. Fish brought in ice has become a little soft. Edible. Then Chintu shouldn't eat. Give him some milk and mango jelly. And keep this rice and fish covered there. When Ganga's mother comes to do the dishes.. ..in the evening, I'll give her. What's this, didn't bathe in Ganges? I'll bathe at home. Ganges water is very dirty. Everything is upside down for you! Bathing in Ganges after going to cremation is the rule. Go, don't touch anything. Hey sister-in-law! Get fire brigade, get fire brigade. Fire. Give.. give. - Giving, man.. giving. Why? Didn't take anything whole day? Not a drop of water, sister.. not a drop of water! Why? Cremation mates are fed. - I don't eat. Why don't you eat? Everybody eats. What are you saying? A few minutes back, I put a man on his pyre. And after five minutes I'll relish sweets and fries.. ..on the expense of his family. What, man, my stomach is burning! - Where? Here, hold. I'll give the milk after heating. Didn't keep rice? - No. Sister-in-law said eating that cold rice at this.. ..odd hour will make you sick. - I won't eat! Chotda! Sister-in-law will get very angry if she comes to know. All nonsense! What will happen with this?! Bulti, you were bluffing me? Here is fish curry rice. - 'Chotda.. Chotda, don't eat!' That is left over of Sejda and sister-in-law! - Oh! Really, you are impossible! That is left over of Sejda and sister-in-law! - Oh! You'd have dumped in trash bin, I'm dumping in trash bin. I don't know, man! If sister-in-law comes to know she'll break lose a hell! You are impossible! - Look.. look who has come.. look, go. Go! - Chotda, don't eat it, I say, listen! Go you.. go. - 'Chotda!' Sister-in-law.. sister-in-law, come soon! Look what Chotda is doing! I'm saying so much but he is not listening at all! What happened again? - Look here. What has happened? Hey Bulti. Hey hopeless, get up, get up I say! Get up! 'Daughter-in-law.' What has happened? What, you started troubling soon on coming home! Look, father-in-law, leftover food. Doesn't he have any sense? Oh good, father himself says, rice is the offering of Goddess Laxmi. Goddess Laxmi gets upset when one wastes rice. Do you hear, father-in-law.. do you hear? Daughter-in-law, it's four thirty, won't you give me tea? Did you see, even the royal Bengal tiger is with me? Monkey, father-in-law is royal Bengal tiger?! If you say that again, I'll rip off your skin! - Sorry.. sorry.. Sorry.. sorry. What they say? Father is heaven, father is duty. But one thing. No matter how much father is heaven father is duty, roars.. ..but he loves me. Yes, I know. He loves me very.. very much. Even though I'm a worthless, good for nothing, ape! And Janoni Janmobhumischo also loves me.. ..very.. very much. - Janoni Janmobhumischo? Yes, sister. There's Janoni (mother) busy in kitchen. "Sister-in-law is my mother, my well wisher, my friend." Is it so, wicked! "You are Durga, Goddess with ten hands." - Is it so! Joking with me! Wait I'll show you! Sister-in-law, leave me.. - No. I won't leave! I won't leave you! "Oh my goodness, leave me please." "Like free wild birds in their happiness." "Oh my goodness, leave me please." "Like dense stream of monsoon is unleashed." "Like dense stream of monsoon is unleashed." "Cloud and wind like a dacoit loot the sky." "Cloud and wind like a dacoit loot the sky." "Oh my goodness, leave me please." "Like free wild birds in their happiness." "Oh my goodness, leave me please." "Oh my goodness who could keep me tamed?" "Like the jungle fire dances in the entire forest." "Oh my goodness who could keep me tamed?" "Like in speed lightening thunders in stormy clouds." "Like in speed lightening thunders in stormy clouds." "Merry laughter comes out breaking all bondages." "Oh my goodness who could keep me tamed?" "Like the jungle fire dances in the entire forest." "Oh my goodness who could keep me tamed?" 'Chintu.. Chintu, why running around like that?!" "What if you fall down?!" Nine thirty. Who knows when electricity will be back? It will be very late for you, father-in-law. If I could get asleep soon on lying soon, daughter-in-law.. Has Saheb returned? You.. you be a little strict, daughter-in-law. I'm saying for his well being. Today, I'm there, So the brothers aren't.. ..being able to open their mouths. But, when I won't be there? Would any of them feed the unemployed younger brother? Until he finds some job, what could the poor fellow do, father-in-law? You are supporting him so much. But does he have any endeavor of finding job? Have you seen the least of effort? All responsibility is on me. I'm an old father, aspiring everywhere daily. This evening too I went to Mr. Taradas. The same old assurance, I'll certainly get a job.. ..for your son, Mr. Biprodas I promise. But without the minimum qualification of being.. ..graduate, how could I even make the application? Genuine explanation. The worthless man has so much attraction for football. If he even had quarter of the quarter part of it for studies.. ..then something would have happened some day. But these days many people get good jobs.. ..on the basis of football, father-in-law. Didn't I try in that line as well, daughter-in-law? - But there too.. But I don't know anything about football these days. In our time we had centre forward, righty, lefty. These days I hear striker, stopper, league man. They are the heroes in the playground these days. But my qualified son is none of these. He is a goalkeeper. And I hear that goalkeeper is not in demand these days. Fate, daughter-in-law, it's all fate. Younger brother-in-law got promotion as officer. You ask him for Saheb, father-in-law. Why do I need to ask, daughter-in-law? Kamol himself should do this for his younger brother. When he doesn't do so, then.. Saheb himself could ask. You know if he asked or not? He won't ask for himself. Actually he doesn't have any.. means, doesn't have any dash. Day and night game.. game, what's he doing even there? When the others in the team are running with the ball.. ..scoring goal, getting applauded.. ..what are you doing then? Then you are standing behind everyone.. ..in the goalpost and enjoying the breeze. Worthless, good for nothing. Don't mind anything, daughter-in-law. But as is my youngest one so is my eldest one too. He too doesn't have any. 'Has no endeavor for his own progress.' 'Since he passed B.A. and entered writers.' 'That's it, with his mouth stitched.. ..he's dragging his pen from ten to five.' 'Will come home in the evening.' 'Then lie on bed and read novel.' So many times I asked him will you.. ..spend whole life as a clerk!' Appear for B.C.S. exam! But who listens to whom. 'Suppose you had many children.' 'Son's education, daughter's marriage.' 'Would it have been possible with that much money?' 'Moreover what is the future of you both?' 'Government job only for namesake.' After retirement how much money will he get in pension? Will it be enough for two people? Don't forget to take your medicine, father-in-law. Keep a sleeping pill too, daughter-in-law. No, father-in-law. Doctor has told you not to take the sleeping pills everyday. No.. no. Tonight.. at least give one for tonight. This night is very, long night for me. Very restless night. When the night ends, exam result will be out. If by God's grace both of them succeed.. Then I'll plead Mr. Taradas for something for Saheb.. And with Mr. Banerjee's son Bulti.. Then I won't have sleepless nights, daughter-in-law. Hey, what is this? What.. what, what's the matter? Do you want to commit suicide? In that crowd at this age? - What are we here for? Come on, take out twenty rupees. - Twenty rupees? Why? - Why means? Don't you want gazette? - The gazette costs.. Grandpa is talking of a reasonable price. Grandpa, what do you get at reasonable price these days? Coal? - Kerosene? And so.. and so a thing of two rupees in twenty rupees? How much your shirt costs? - Grandpa, cost of your life? Oh. So bring the gazette. - Take out the money. Hand to hand delivery. We aren't snatchers, respectable citizen. Yes. Helping people like you is our profession. Give. Now grab it, close eyes and go home straight. - Go. Otherwise either this will get snatched.. ..or you will get stranded. Go. Daughter-in-law. Daughter-in-law. You must know Saheb's roll number? I will see, father-in-law. Father-in-law, second class! Bulti got second class! Okay. And Saheb? Daughter-in-law, Saheb? 'Nobody will be able to stop Saheb, Dr. Banerjee.' 'Nobody will be able to.' 'I cannot claim anything about Bishu and Kamol.' 'But Saheb, I'm sure, I'm very sure!' He will be in to the university team for certain! Nobody will be able to stop! Just one matter. The selectors shouldn't do any partiality. You kindly contact them, Mr. Banerjee. Please. You understand. Yes. Yes. So we'll meet on the ground in the evening. Okay. What, you here? Come on, go home, eat and take rest. What's there to be so nervous about? Play with zeal today. - I won't play, Shombhuda. What did you say? You won't play? Have you gone mad? Your whole career is depending.. ..on this trial match today. Do you know? My career is finished, Shombhuda. Absolutely finished. Oh, you couldn't pass this time also I guess? Do one thing, take off the shirt and relax your limbs. Do you hear? Saheb will eat here. - No.. no, Shombhuda. Quiet! Sit is say. Sit! Some milk, two hand made chapattis, that's all. Hey fellow. Hey fellow! Get up. Get up, I say. Come with me. Come. Have a look. Vacate gallery, isn't it? Now close eyes and see. I.F.A. shield final match is going on in Santosh trophy. Do you see? Two people are standing on both the goalposts. Can't you be one of those two people? Don't you want such a day in your life? - I want. I want, Shombhuda.. I want. Today you've to play the match in that manner, Saheb. I'll play whole heartedly. Today, I'll play whole heartedly. - 'Good.' 'That's what is needed.' That's what is needed. Come. Shombhuda, if I get selected in the university team.. ..will I get a job with Dr. Banerjee's reference? A job of any kind? Too much trouble at home, Shombhuda. Father is growing old. Father is very worried for me, Shombhuda. Has Saheb come? Ten thirty. Sister-in-law said you shouldn't make late. Saheb should meet me when he comes. You eat food, father. Where were you the whole day?! Why are you not answering?! Say! Where were you?! Here an old man is getting tensed. And you, not eaten whole day, nothing! Ah, why don't I die! Go and get freshened quickly, I'm serving food. I'm not hungry. Saheb! I don't have time to quarrel.. ..with you at this odd hour at night! Worrying the whole day has made me angry! Do what I say if you don't want any trouble! Otherwise.. Why are you asking him, sister-in-law? He's hungry that's why sir has come home. Otherwise he won't get a handful.. ..other than this charity of brothers! You brothers sit together and decide.. ..something about this, brother-in-law! He'll fail year after year, who'll bear the study expense? Why should the brothers take so many responsibilities? Exactly. - College fees, coaching fees. Is it any less? - Moreover eating expense, clothes. I'd have worked as a loader to earn my expenses. 'You are right.' I'm saying clearly, sister-in-law, I'm no more in this! Understand? - 'When he can't study, then spending.. ..so much money means nothing!' Rather tell him, he should find some job. Who will give me job, Sejda, you? - One has to try! Football ground is not employment exchange. My name is enrolled in the employment exchange. Moreover I wander from door to door. Didn't I tell you a thousand times, Sejda? Get me a job of just any sort! Did you get? But you got your brother-in-law.. ..into your office a few months ago. He has qualification, he is a graduate. And you? I asked for just any job, Sejda. Didn't I say, peon, waiter, I'll do any job? Very well said. Isn't there any prestige! Where elder brother is an officer.. ..there younger brother is peon, waiter! A while ago you were lecturing about.. ..being loader, sister-in-law. If you don't lose prestige by carrying loads on streets.. ..you'll lose prestige by delivering files.. ..and water to tables in office, can you say why? Do you hear, do you hear what your brother is saying?! What, did I say anything wrong? Or is it a crime? - Shut up! I'll tear open your mouth! - Brother-in-law. Don't you know how to talk to elders! Dear, brother.. - Because I don't say anything.. ..you'll cross all limits! - Sit.. sit.. sit, brother.. No.. no, you don't understand, sister-in-law! I understand, you sit and eat. Saheb, you go.. you go! No, sister-in-law.. - Quiet. No I.. I won't go, sister-in-law.. - I'm saying you go.. Why would they say like that? Did you see.. did you see Mejdi, how wicked he is?! He is arguing over everyone! No.. no, I.. What crime have I done? - Go please! No.. no what crime have I done can you say? Manner less. - Whatever they say I listen.. Your.. your indulgence has made him worthless. And father just talks in air! - Did you see? If he fails I'll throw him out of house! You shouldn't say anything. - Where, let him throw out! Can you say what crime have I done? Shame.. shame.. shame! Shame! My client is sitting in the guest room. And you people are shouting like cheap slum dwellers! What has happened? Ask your qualified brother what has happened. Hey. Hey fool, what has happened? Sister-in-law said, ask your qualified brother. Ask your qualified brother! Congratulations, sister! What is this, I failed, and you are crying? Oh no. Hey wicked girl, you've to give me a treat, one day. Won't you? Saheb, come to my room. I have to say one thing to you. Only one thing. Before I die you let me know that you.. ..have become self dependent. Earning your own.. If you had passed today, then perhaps some way.. ..would have been found by pleading, Mr. Taradas. But that is.. Fate. I don't even have the money that I.. ..could get you into some small business. I'm not able to understand how I will get Bulti married. So from my side any kind of.. Moreover the way you brothers love each other.. I don't believe that they will feed you.. ..even a handful after I die. In between daughter-in-law's life is getting cursed! So think about what you'll do. Go. It's eleven o' clock, you eat food, father. 'Chotda.' Chotda. Hey Chotda. - 'What?' What did father say? - Nothing new. What a man are you! Day and night just play and play! If you had paid a little attention in studies.. Stop.. stop, you don't need to preach. Come on, put off light and sleep. If you had passed today, everyone.. ..would have been so happy. Will you stop! Since stepping in the house I'm getting lectures! Studies won't happen for me! Everyone cannot do everything! Didn't happen in three times means it will never happen. Kamol said it rightly, making him study means wasting money. What's your opinion, sister-in-law? Will you take two more chapattis? - No. You tell, father. The household expense will come down a little at least. You people say. - When you eldest brother is present? Wow! Surprising! I see you have no interest.. ..at all in any matters of the household. You go upstairs and send Bulti. Bulti is younger, she too passed and you! A blemish of the family. A forced liability dumped on our shoulder forever. Bulti. Hey Bulti. Bulti! There's news today. - Let it be. I have no interest in the news about your play. 'Bulti, your sister-in-law is calling you for dinner!' 'It's so late night, why didn't you eat?' Why are you concerned? Come to eat. 'I said I'm not hungry!' Sister-in-law has not eaten the whole day! This is.. this is very wrong of sister-in-law. Does sister-in-law ever eat without making you eat? Wrong, very wrong. You girls are just.. Hopeless. Hopeless Sister-in-law. This doesn't mean anything! What's the meaning of not eating the whole day? Starving for a useless fellow like me, I don't like! I don't like at all! Where, your food? Rather you don't think about me. Eat. Should have thought earlier. Then I wouldn't have had to hang my head down.. ..in front of so many people. 'What happened, why are you sitting with folded arms?' Made a big mistake. No I mean, I couldn't meet you before.. ..going to the ground in the evening. So means.. How you played? - Everyone said, Shombhuda also said.. ..if the selectors do not do partiality. My chance is fixed in inter university team. And if I get chance, I'll certainly get a job. Then you won't have to hang your head down.. ..in front of everyone. You won't have to be worried about me. Be quiet, hopeless.. be quiet. Chotda! Hey Chotda! Chotda! Sister-in-law! Sister-in-law! Sister-in-law! Sister-in-law! Look quickly.. look quickly! Look Chotda is selected, in university team! What are you saying, Mr. Banerjee? Say about your convenience and inconvenience. I'm father of the girl, for me no tomorrow if today. No evening if morning. Pardon? Huh, if in this way his name got printed in the gazette.. ..then at least something by pleading Mr. Taradas.. Forget it. No use of thinking about that hopeless person. Listen, daughter-in-law, this evening I along with Bulti.. They want to see Bulti. Daughter-in-law, listen. Do you know how Saheb plays? He certainly plays well, father-in-law. Otherwise would he have got the chance? I was saying.. next time he'll have a match. Let me know, I'll go. Take care nobody should come to know. 'Here, eat.' This is your first installment. Later when you'll come back after winning trophy, then.. On winning, will I get a job, Shombhuda? You will, man.. you will. I will get you into railways! Permanent job, comfortable job! I don't need comfort, Shombhuda. You.. you just get me, just any job.. ..ticket collector, engine driver whatever! Can't endure anymore at home. Stay mum for a few more days. Pay attention in practice. Later when you'll get something.. ..you'll see change in everyone's attitude. Come on. Come on, eat it. You know, Shombhuda, on seeing this.. ..sister-in-law will dance with joy. I don't have the least interest in old news. So you noticed the small news. Why just me, father-in-law too has seen. My goodness. What he said? What he said, you guess. What new would he say, sister-in-law? He said throw the hopeless out of house. - No. Then? - He said, I'll go to watch.. ..Saheb playing one day, daughter-in-law. I've never seen how the hopeless plays. Really? Truly, sister-in-law? Father will watch.. 'Sister-in-law, serve food quickly, getting late for office!' Bulti. Bulti, are you there? Hey Bulti! - What? 'What are you doing?' Say what you've to say. You know, Bulti, royal Bengal tiger wants to watch me play! Unimaginable! No, I need to do something. He is.. in much suffering. You understood after so long? - No. I felt for long. But.. You watch, this time it will happen. Shombhuda has said, he'll get me in railways. Then ticket collector. Or.. or.. Engine driver. I'll take the shovel and.. ..put coal into the engine. You'll see, all his worries will vanish. You watch. 'Father.' - Who Amol? 'Yes father.' - Bimol, Kamol and daughters-in-law? 'They all have come, father.' Have you all eaten? One second, wait a little. But you yourself have not eaten yet, father-in-law. I will eat, daughter-in-law. First, let me speak. Then I will eat with a peaceful mind. What's this, why you all standing? Sit. I'll say the matter in short. Sit.. sit. The matter is very important that's why I called you all. Bulti's marriage, I've almost fixed it. Bulti's marriage? - Direct marriage? Almost fixed? - You've almost fixed? The boy is a doctor. Has got gold medal in surgery. Going abroad next month for doing F.R.C.S. They wish daughter-in-law also goes with the son. Bulti will go abroad, sister-in-law? In our family second class honours, abroad? Unimaginable. Husband and wife both, have liked Bulti very much. And even the boy was let to meet in private. As per the modern day practice. So the boy too has liked Bulti very much. Now they want to get the marriage done soon. Means on coming fifteenth. - Fifteenth? But within so short time.. - Why, what's the problem? Marriage can't be done by spending money in the city.. ..of Kolkata, this statement doesn't mean anything. Father, when you've liked then it will be on fifteenth. We all are here, whatever you order we'll do. But, Bimol, I expect something more than this from you all. Till today I never wanted any help from you all. I got you educated as per my worth, got you married. Also got two daughters married. All with my own earnings. I got this house renovated, built two new rooms. After all this, you can understand.. ..I've nothing left as my own savings. Practically now I'm dependent on you all. Hence I've called you here. You all will have to do this last responsibility for me. Now you all say, in what manner you can help me? How much do they demand, father-in-law? No, junior daughter-in-law they don't demand anything? If they had then I couldn't have proceeded. No need to give jewellery to the bride. Nothing special needed in dowry. Bed, cupboard, furniture, nothing of these. Only getting the bride wedded in wedding dress will do. But, have to give them fifteen thousand rupees in cash. Oh. - Not before marriage, in September. When they'll go abroad. Because the money will be needed as their passage.. ..money and expenses there for the first few days. But they want the money as a loan, but that is not important. So this fifteen. So this fifteen thousand.. ..and I added another five thousand for marriage expense. Daughter-in-law, will this do? - You carry on, father-in-law. Invitees.. even after short listing I couldn't.. ..bring down less than two hundred. Means two thousand. - No, father. Two hundred people in two thousand rupees? Means per plate ten rupees, sister-in-law? In this expensive market it will fetch nothing.. ..apart from fries and a mixed vegetable. If it is twenty rupees per plate or at least eighteen.. ..then something worth could be fed to modest people. Father shouldn't get defamed, sister-in-law. Yes, father-in-law, count it four thousand. Shall I say something more, sister-in-law? Our roof is very small, if we hire the wedding hall. I know a decorator, he'll charge less money. Decoration, marriage aisle, and even band.. And decorate the whole house with tiny bulbs. How much extra will the expense be, sister-in-law? Bulti is younger than all of us, this is father's last duty too. Won't it be good to do it in a better way, sister-in-law? So what if more expenses will be there? Daughter-in-law, you write. Father-in-law, materials for wedding night, groom's ring. And all miscellaneous expenses.. ..will make a total of twenty seven thousand. So far so good. Left is bridal jewellery. 'Jewellery?' But they didn't demand Jewellery, daughter-in-law. Even if they have not demanded.. ..sending the girl empty handed to in-laws' house.. ..your honour will be harmed, father-in-law. At least a piece of gold on hands, neck and on ears. So it would be about 8 to 10 ounces. Yesterday the rate was 1400 rupees per ounce. That means fourteen thousand. Plus making charge. Father-in-law, ask how much your three sons.. ..will contribute each for this cause. The jewellery is Saheb's responsibility. - I? How will I get? - Return me later. For the time being I will give you. You? Where will you get so much money? Where could I get money, father-in-law? These. What are you saying, daughter-in-law?! No.. no, a long life is ahead you people! I know you both have no savings. Will have to come across so many needs. What will you do then if you loose these? If you are talking about needs, father-in-law. Then tell me what could be more needful.. ..then getting a daughter married? Bulti has come to me as my sister-in-law. If she had come to me as my daughter. Then you people would have told me. You are mother, can't you take off your ornaments.. ..for sending your daughter to in-laws' house. Daughter-in-law.. daughter-in-law, don't say anymore. I'll accept, child. I'll certainly accept your charity through Saheb's hands. What's the shame in accepting mother's charity? I'll accept with both my hands, child. Means.. father I'm government employee. Provident fund is.. what is my own contribution. The maximum loan what I'll get, I.. I'll certainly give you. How much will it be? Seven eight thousand? No means.. five or six. - Five. Bimol? - Well, father you know that.. ..my practice is not as such yet.. Means I get a few clients because of.. ..father-in-law's contacts. You consider two thousand. You can consider two thousand from me too, father. So it makes nine. I need thirty. Okay all right, now you all may leave. So then.. how to arrange the rest of the money, father? What could be arranged within these few days, brother? I feel, leave this alliance, father. Bulti is not so old and by then we too will.. ..arrange something then rather.. And if I don't live till then? No, Bimol, I won't leave Bulti on you people. Bulti will get married here only, fifteenth. This is my final decision. I will spend thirty thousand rupees. I may even spend more. My last responsibility. Go to sleep, its late night. You all may sleep worriless. Nobody needs to give even a paisa. I have money you know I've money. I will sell this house. If you sell house where will we go? Hire some flat or something. Is flat available on just wishes, father? It is available on giving a deposit. I will give you that money. The money I get after selling this house. From that whatever will be left after getting Bulti married.. ..I will distribute it equally among you four brothers. From that you give deposit or advance.. ..whatever and stay as you like. 'And you?' - You may rather not think about me. But I've a request, you people take care that.. ..everything goes well in the marriage. Father-in-law. Father-in-law. Can't you borrow from your friends? No. So much money.. Okay look, let me do one thing. Tomorrow I'll bunk office and go to Ranaghat.. ..to Shanti's place. - Sister-in-law? Yes. What's the harm? She is also father's daughter. Won't she help father in trouble? No, dear, sister-in-law is frank person that's right. But her husband is absolute businessman. He won't be able to give remainders.. ..to father-in-law of the loan money. Asking them is a vain. Will be humiliation of father-in-law as well. 'Hey, listen, go to your father's house tomorrow.' Why? - 'Ah, listen first.' Listen, go and ask your father to give us.. ..thirty thousand rupees. - So nice. Has my father opened a charity?! But am I'm not demanding money for nothing?! Mortgaging this house. - Then? What then? - Your father, you brothers.. ..will you be able to repay the money? No, we won't be able ever. - So then? So then what? - My father's money will go as waste? Why would it go wasted, Madhu? My father's house, with interest and capital.. ..is your father's beloved grandson's. Look, the matter of selling this house is a boon in disguise. This old house, staying together with everyone, huh. We'll have a nice flat, what say? - Who'll pay the rent? Office couldn't provide quarters. So won't they give house allowance? That won't be sufficient, that's it. Moreover, father-in-law will give some money.. ..after selling the house. That will get spent in the advance for flat. Tell the office suppliers they'll give you a flat? - What, bribe? Hey moron, as if you don't take bribe! Drama. Hey. - What? Get a second hand car, dear. Bulti. Hey Bulti, hey how does the boy look? How you felt after meeting? Do you like him? Hey Bulti! 'Tell me, you like him?' No, not at the least. You tell sister-in-law and stop this marriage. - 'Why?' 'Bulti?' Gardener. Hey gardener! Is doctor at home.. Doctor?! Dr. Ronodeb Banerjee! Thank you, gardener.. thank you! Junior sir. I'm Bulti's Chotda. - Gulti? No.. no.. no.. no, not gulti (catapult)! Bulti.. Bulti. She came here with father yesterday. Oh, so you are talking about Bondona Debi? - Bondona? Oh yes.. yes.. yes! I never remember her good name! Ronodeb, Bondona, wow. - 'You be seated.' Five ten? - No, five eleven. - Wow. - Wow. Okay then this means.. - This means? There. - There? Yes.. yes. Wow. Will you give this to me? I'll give Bulti. Why, did she ask for? Does any girl do that, sir? - But, she had seen me. On getting this she'll see you all the time. That's it. But, in exchange I too could give you this. Give me, I'll take it out of frame. 'Take this.' What happened? Take. - That photo? My father. - Father? Yes. - Means, in.. in.. in garden? Yes.. yes. - Father is very fond of gardening. What happened? What has happened? - No. No means? - No. What? Hey.. What happened, where are you going?! Listen! Sorry. I'm very sorry. Bulti! Bulti! Sister-in-law, fantastic! Bulti's husband, fantastic! Absolutely handsome man. Where did you get this? James Bond, 007. Top secret. Really, he looks like a prince. But look at the girl, gloomy since yesterday. Yes, sister-in-law, last night she blabbered nonsense to me. Is she in love with someone? - No, dear.. no. Before marriage every girl happens to be like this. Because she'll have to leave father's house. So this is the matter! - Hey give it to me! Let me show Madhobi and Gopa! - No leave it. The nose is little blunt, isn't it, Mejdi? - Hey. The forehead seems little smaller. - Come on! The lips.. Yes, Mejdi, a little broad. 'Bulti.' 'Hey Bulti.' I stole a thing from your room. Look at the wall behind. Don't be angry. Here, take it back. Take! Dear, have a look! Do you know cooking? - Yes, I do. Teach me a little. No I mean in abroad.. ..everyone cooks for himself. So, if I learn I could help you a little. Sit.. sit. You must know singing? - Not that good. What songs, Robindroshongeet? Yes. Some Nojrulgiti (Songs written by Kazi Nojrul). Some folk songs. B.. But I'm not tr.. trained singer. I learnt from gramophone and radio. Fine, sing one for me. Singing in this open lawn, what will the neighbours think? All right then inside house. - But father is there. Your parents are there. - Oh. All right, then I'll hear later. Okay? Have you been to Nainital? - No. My plan is, that after our marriage.. ..we'll go to Nainital for a week. Return this.. to one whom this belongs to, Chotda. - Why? By selling house.. No.. no! that should never happen, Chotda. What craziness is this, is the house really getting sold? Father said that by getting angry on sons. Some arrangement is certainly planned. 'Saheb, someone is calling.' Verdict, this marriage will happen.. happen.. happen. Shombhuda, to.. to.. today.. - What? A bunch full immediately on climbing the tree?! Your name got printed in the newspaper.. ..and you immediately bunked practice?! Today I got stuck with a job, Shombhuda. - Job, what Job? From now you won't have any job apart from football. This morning Dr. Banerjee came to watch the practice.. ..with so much fruits, and the real man was absent! Won't happen again, Shombhuda. From now in morning, evening.. - No.. no. I don't believe you at all. Call your sister-in-law. Call sister-in-law! I'll tell sister-in-law that from now you shouldn't.. ..be involved in any family matters! No.. no, Shombhuda I'll go for sure. 'Daughter-in-law.' - Shombhuda, father. Come for practise in the evening. - Okay.. okay. Daughter-in-law, I'll come after a while. I'll pray to God and go out for a work. Why are you standing like a joker at the door? If you give me Bulti's wedding card. I'd have taken to the press. - First let me arrange for that! Meet me in the evening. Durga.. Durga. Hey, I forgot my glasses. Old man is like a coconut, rough outside soft from inside. Old man has marked the news? 'Junior uncle.' Grandpa said, how long should grandpa wait. Yes. Yes, I'm coming. Daughter-in-law, keep the house documents. What? - You said you'll give the wedding cards in the evening. I still couldn't make any arrangement. Daughter-in-law, you know what is kidney? - 'Kidney?' 'Yes kidney.' No, father-in-law. I've heard that kidney is present in the stomach. I can't say what it exactly is. 'Do you know?' - I too know just that much. Inside the stomach are liver, kidney all these. Why, father? No.. no, just like that. Are you having some pain in the stomach? No.. no, what pain. Then suddenly asking about kidney? Well that gentleman was saying something.. ..happened to his kidney, he's of my age.. Hey daughter-in-law, you didn't give me tea? You've not freshened up yet, father-in-law. - Oh yes.. yes. Daughter-in-law, old man is up to something. Worrying has made the man absolutely lost. What's going to happen? Father. Father isn't here? What are you doing here? Looking to steal money? The bathroom bulb is not working. Bimol, you want to say something? Well, have you decided to sell the house? What's the use of deciding? Spent the whole day at the attorney's place. Didn't get any assurance. Customer will search for some things. Government permission, this that. It will take time. I've no time at all. - It's fused. Oh. Money bag is in pocket, take the money. I've liked the boy very much. Fate. Father, I was saying that instead of selling completely.. What, sister-in-law I mean if mortgage means pawning? Madhobi too was saying the same. I have no objection on anything, daughter-in-law. So do you have any client who'll keep mortgage? No. I don't have any client who'll take.. ..out thirty thousand rupees in one go. But if you permit, then I can try within my acquaintances. Your eldest son was saying about sister-in-law, Shanti. No.. no, daughter-in-law. I'll borrow from daughter and son-in-law? Shame. Father's honour will be harmed, sister-in-law. Oh yes, I forgot. Worrying for Bulti's marriage nothing is coming to mind. Father, I met Shanti's elder brother-in-law. He came to court for some work. Son-in-law too was along. So hearing Bulti's marriage they were very happy. But perhaps Shanti won't be able to come on marriage day. Her children's exams are getting over on fifteenth. She'll come the day after marriage in evening. First see if the marriage happens or not. Why is father being do disheartened, sister-in-law. Let him command, I'll send my wife today itself to her father. From your father-in-law? Shall I beg to relatives, daughter-in-law? You aren't asking for nothing, father-in-law. What's the harm? But you know what, daughter-in-law? Father, you were just saying there's no time. I know, Bimol.. I know. But I've always held my head high. So.. You people give me some time. Hey, where did the newspaper go, daughter-in-law? Here it is. - No.. no, that is today's newspaper. I wanted yesterday's. Just now I saw it here. Who took it? Alright, I'll see. I desperately need the newspaper, daughter-in-law. Hello? Is Mr. Sinha there? You won't know me. There was an insertion in yesterday's newspaper. Yes. I want to speak about that matter. Yes I'm the candidate myself. What's your age? Age.. age.. age? Twenty two? Very good. Listen, you do one thing, meet me. Yes at my house, tomorrow morning. At 9 sharp? All right then. - One more thing. Have you got any other candidate apart from me? No.. no I was saying even if you get someone.. ..in the mean time, don't accept, sir, please. Give me the chance, sir.. give me. What's wrong? - Yesterday's newspaper. Saheb. Did you take yesterday's.. ..newspaper from father-in-law's room? No. Tell me why? - Father-in-law is searching. What, sister-in-law? - Yesterday's newspaper. I wonder who threw it where.. Saheb, you bring the paper from the neighbours. No. Tell me why father needs it? Your name is in the newspaper. Don't we wish to see it time and again? - No. If it had been in the gazette, then I'd have appreciated. Craziness, you understand, sister-in-law. Craziness has got the old man. - Hopeless. Bulti, rather you go and bring. 'No this'll turn me mad I see.' 'Creating some or the other problem everyday.' 'The ship will set sail tomorrow evening.' 'And you're telling me now? Well..' If men are needed then employ men. And as much money you want take if from office. Remember the job must be done. Strange matter. My firm is so old, shouldn't get defamed. Ah, listen.. listen! Please use your brain, understand? Don't bother me in every matter. You know very well, how my days are passing in mental ordeal. Have pity on this poor father. You won't back off at last moment I guess? You come to my office this evening, before five thirty. I'll take you to my doctor for a thorough check-up. One matter, sir. In the newspaper you wrote, you are ready.. ..to pay any price for the kidney. May I know how much? - Any price you want. Life of my only son. No matter how much money is needed.. Say, how much you want? - Thirty thousand. Not a paisa less, nor a paisa more. But I'll take the money in advance. Suppose if I want today? - You'll get. After my doctor okays you. Hello? Yes, I'm Sinha speaking. Yes, in newspaper day before yesterday. Are you talking about yourself? - Sir.. Very sorry, please don't mind. Hearing the voice, it feels you are quite old. - That I am. I.. I.. I'm sixty five. But I've no disease. I'm healthy. Able, hard working. I hope I won't be useless for your purpose. Pardon. I'm too old? May I come in? - 'Come in.' Hey come.. come, Mr. Sinha.. sit! Hey, come. What's this, Saheb, you?! - Do you know him? I know means? He is our only star of our star sporting club. Has got chance in the university team this time. But, Mr. Sinha I'm unable to understand. How come you came in contact with him? On seeing the insertion in newspaper he contacted me. What? No.. no, how could that happen? Sit, Mr. Sinha. Saheb, you also sit. A promising footballer.. Saheb, have you thought about all the points before proceeding? Dr. Banerjee, please. My son's life is depending on him. My only son. And you are my family physician. Please do what is expected of you! Oh please don't be excited, Mr. Sinha. I'm your family physician, but I'm a doctor first! I have my ethics! I have responsibility. Sit, Saheb. Sit. Listen to me carefully. You've come to donate kidney. But do you know what kidney is, what is kidney function? It's a very delicate organ. 'The kidney is here towards the backside.' 'Do you know what kidney function is?' 'Kidney is almost like a sieve.' 'All impure materials of the human body.. ..gets excreted through the kidney.' 'In absence of kidney..' - Dr. Banerjee, your.. ..medical complexities won't go into my thick brain. I just know this much that we all have two kidneys. Amputating one doesn't make any.. ..huge difference in the normal life. But look, Mr. Sinha's only son's life.. ..is at stake because of severe disease. Pailo-nephritis. - Both his kidneys are useless. If I donate a kidney, his life will get saved. Why should I deny, I too would gain something. He needs kidney, I need money. So you are determined? - Yes, Dr. Banerjee. I have decided. Do your relatives and family know? Does Shombhu know? My fate is very pleased, Br. Banerjee. Shombhuda is in Asansol with the team. He will return in a day or two. Even then I want to tell you two more things. First, any operation, major or minor. No matter how ever skilled surgeon does the operation. 'Still there remains a risk.' Dr. Banerjee, the streets of Kolkata are also a risk. I can get run over any moment. Amputating one kidney out of the two you'll.. ..perhaps be able to walk and move like normal people. But, playing football.. will be over for life. Saheb, don't forget you got chance in university team. Your future, your football career will get doomed. Dr. Banerjee, thousands of intelligent students.. ..give up studies due to lack of money. None of us keep track of their doomed life. And if the career of a footballer like me gets doomed.. ..it doesn't make any big difference. Come.. come, doctor. The issue is now settled. Tell me, when will you be able to do the transplant? As early as possible. Listen, you get admitted here tomorrow. Have to sign a bond. Here you are, thirty thousand. Count it. What happened? You said you want thirty thousand rupees. Not a paisa more, nor a paisa less. So, you want more money? Say, how much money? My only son. I'm ready to give everything for his sake. Say, how much money? Here.. here! Mr. Sinha, if I die on the operation table.. ..then the problem is over. And if I survive.. Will you give me a job? You have a huge firm. So many workers. Will you take me? But I am not a graduate, couldn't pass even this time. But peon, waiter, whatever. Then I'd have repaid your money.. ..gradually from my salary. I don't want to sell my kidney, sir, believe me. But my father, I couldn't do anything for him ever. That old man.. that old man is in deep trouble, sir! Father. - What happened, Bimol? What did your father-in-law say? Father will withdraw the money from bank.. ..tomorrow in the first hour. He has sent this. You have a look. - What is this? Draft of the document for mortgaging the house. Your father is a lawyer, he has made a draft. So why do I need to see? Wherever he says I'll sign with closed eyes. - No, father. It's better to be careful in property matters. So then shall we leave, father? - Yes, go.. go. Sister-in-law, nobody is outside I suppose. I've closed the main door. Very sorry, sister-in-law. I got stuck with a work. You didn't eat whole day. Very bad, I've said.. There's an occasion at home after a couple of days. It would be a little better if you stop hanging up outside. The money has been arranged? Or else is father-in-law sitting assured of you?! I'll be back, sister-in-law. Father. - Hats off to your responsibility! Was asking me for wedding cards since morning! And missing at the right time! Give this to the press. Don't forget to post this letter to Shanti. Have you been kind to close the main door? - Yes. What? - I was saying, you don't need to borrow.. ..money from anyone for Bulti's marriage, father. That means? Don't tell anyone, father, I've arranged the money. You? How much money? What you wanted, thirty thousand. Thirty thousand, you?! 'Where you got it from?' Stole, robbed, looted?! - Father.. Shut up! Father, never call me father! Get out.. get out of the house right now! I shouldn't even see your face ever! My son.. an antisocial! God, what crime have I done that you.. ..punished me so severely? Why are you standing?! Pick those up and get out! Get lost from here! Father, I never forget that I'm your son. Your son will do any cheap deed, do you believe this? This is not wrong money, father. This money.. this money Chotdi sent to you. - Shanti? Yes. This morning I went to Ranaghat at Chotdi's place. On hearing about mortgaging of house, Chotdi herself gave. She said it could be repaid in installments later. I told Chotdi without informing any of you. So are you angry, father? You.. you don't mind anything, son. Suddenly seeing so much money in your hand.. ..I spoke a lot of rude words. - So what, father? Then call daughter-in-law, she'll keep these safe. Sister-in-law.. sister-in-law is asleep, father. What, you are not at home, without.. ..making you eat daughter-in-law.. Th.. this never happen so? I forced her, father. I said sleep peacefully tonight. From tomorrow morning you've to toil for the marriage. You did well. So you.. The key is under the pillow. - Okay. The key. Why are you at my feet? - Tomorrow I'll go to Delhi.. ..to play in Ashutosh trophy. Early morning flight. That is your time of worship, so.. - Bulti's marriage is.. ..in a couple of days, who'll manage if you go away? I will have to go, father, this is my fight for life and death. There's possibility of a job. - Oh. Then I shouldn't stop you. You need a job, you desperately need it. What should I say? Be victorious. You be victorious. Put off the light and go to sleep, father, it's very late. We have won.. we have won! Mejda and sister-in-law were proceeding towards.. ..the house with their claws stretched. Off side! That means? - Means? Means our free kick! Mortgage house! From now no tears in eyes, no gloomy face, not anything! The house won't be mortgaged or sold! Your small.. small immature elder brothers.. ..won't be restless. Hence, hey sister, from today you don't need to live.. ..in this house with a bowed head in front of anyone. You'll go to in-laws' house with a bang.. ..on the old man's money. Where did father get money? Those are trifle matters, you ask sister-in-law, sister. I wish to whip you and rip off your skin. If you intended to go to sister-in-law in Ranaghat. Why didn't you tell me before going? I thought would I get the money from Chotdi or not.. Rather let the matter be in suspense. - Hopeless! How does it feel now, sister-in-law? It feels as if a load has been alighted from the heart. This is the fun of maintaining suspense. Understand? Oh no, you're stretching your legs so forward! Okay.. okay, no need of showing so much devotion. Do I devote for nothing, sister-in-law? Your feet are my safety armour. When I enter the playground, what should I tell you! As if you stop the penalty with ten hands. Sister-in-law, will I be able to win the last match as well? You eat, I'll give medicine to father. Father is asleep, sister-in-law. - What?! Yes, dear, he said today I'll sleep worriless. You sit.. sit. The vegetable is grand, sister-in-law. Is there anymore? Leave it. Give me jaggery.. jaggery. "So many dreams, remains just dreams." "So many flowers shed, so long the memory remains." "So many masts bend after coming to shore." "Does.. does history keep everything in record?" "There is a game which ruins other games." "Many rivers have to flow towards deserts." "The deaf doesn't know what sound is." "Does history keep everything in record?" "All flowers are not offered to god." "They are used for final rituals." "Why do we knowingly wish to play the broken flute?" "Does history keep everything in record?" "So many dreams, remains just dreams." "So many flowers shed, so long the memory remains." "So many masts bend after coming to shore." "Does.. does history keep everything in record?" "Does history keep everything in record?" I've come, Dr. Banerjee. Dr. Sen. - Come. Let me see. - Medicines, injection, so many.. ..hassles you people are making since morning. Tomorrow morning is my operation, isn't it, sister? Quiet please. - Oh, you won't say, if I get nervous? Will I regain sense before tomorrow evening, sister? Put off the light and go to sleep. You know, sister, tomorrow evening.. ..my sister will get married. Lighting, clarion.. Now you go upstairs and relax a little, father-in-law. You had been toiling too much for a few days. - Yes. Daughter-in-law, till now I used to worry.. ..when will I get the girl married off. Now on seeing her cry I'm feeling. What would have been the harm.. ..if I kept her with me for a few more days. Daughter-in-law, after getting into the car.. ..what did Bulti whisper into your ears? About Saheb. She said, don't forget to inform.. ..me after Chotda comes back, sister-in-law. She loved Saheb very much and Saheb too loved her. If Saheb had been here at this time.. ..it would have been very good, daughter-in-law. Ganga's mother. - 'Coming, sister-in-law.' Wash off these banana leaves. We'll use these tonight, won't take out utensils. 'Listen, where are you?!' - 'What is it?!' Come.. come.. come.. come. - 'Oh my, you all have come!' Okay.. okay no need to greet me. First go and meet grandpa, then I'll listen.. ..to the stories of your mischief, okay? Come. Come.. come. Okay.. okay. If you had come a while ago, sister-in-law.. Bulti went off just now. - How is Bulti's groom, sister-in-law? He's a prince, sister-in-law.. a prince. What to tell you, dear? Let you stay happy for ever. Father-in-law is blessing you a hundred times. He was saying Shanti did what.. ..my ten sons would have done. I? What have I done? You have a generous heart, sister-in-law. That's why you are feeling shy. But if that day you wouldn't have sent.. ..thirty thousand rupees with Saheb. Then the next day father-in-law would have had to.. ..mortgage the house for Bulti's marriage. What vague are you talking, sister-in-law? I've not ever seen even three thousand rupees together. Didn't you give money to Saheb a few days ago? Sister-in-law, I met Saheb last time.. ..when I came during the festival last year. What's the matter, sister-in-law, you here? I'm waiting for you since two hours, brother. You have any news of Saheb? - No. I went to Asansol. Why? What has happened? A few days ago he went to Delhi, there's no news then. What are you saying, sister-in-law? The team is going to Delhi by early morning flight tomorrow. What? Then where did he go? Well, do you know anyone who could.. ..give him thirty thousand rupees? Thirty thousand rupees? You are talking about Arabian nights, sister-in-law. The president of our chub did say that he'll give him.. ..some pocket money before going to Delhi. But.. but how much money could that be? Wait.. wait, I'll see. 'Hello? Please call Dr. Banerjee.' 'He isn't there?' Can you say where to find him? Kindly say the number please. Thank you. You people please leave. Shombhu. Where did he get so much money from? I'm not getting any clue. - Theft, dacoit. What else could it be? I think.. he has joined some robber gang. You are right, Mejdi. The day Saheb went, the bank on the main street across the.. ..crossing was robbed of one lakh twenty thousand rupees. Didn't you see in the newspaper the next day? Shame, what nonsense robbery and all you're saying. Why? She is saying right. Aha, why are you making bad comments without knowing? Saheb will come back after two days. Then we'll come to know everything. If he doesn't come back? What if he goes underground fearing the police? I'm telling you straight, Borda, you people don't.. ..involve me in any of Saheb's matters! I won't fight case for a criminal and won't even get bail. Whether he's my brother or whoever! You stay assured, brother-in-law. You won't have to fight case for a criminal brother. I won't even ask for getting bail. Gopa, give me father's food. You are supporting your pampered brother-in-law! But police won't leave him, understand?! Will arrest him and take away! What a shame, will we be able to face the society! Brother-in-law, do you believe that Saheb could do.. ..something that makes father-in-law bow his head? So do you want to say he won a lottery.. ..of thirty thousand rupees overnight? You people must have heard of Mr. Sinha. Mr. A.K. Sinha. - Mr. A.K. Sinha? Means Sinha textiles? - Yes. His only son, both of his kidneys became useless with nephritis. In return of thirty thousand rupees.. ..Saheb donated one of his kidney and saved his life. When we all were enjoying in the wedding. Then Saheb was lying on operation table.. ..and was fighting with death! Playing football is his devotion, his love. Even after knowing that he won't be able to play.. ..football ever in life, he signed the bong with pleasure. Why, sister-in-law? Who gave him the wicked idea of playing with his life? Ask these people, sister-in-law. These earning brothers of yours, how much money did.. ..they gave father-in-law for their sister's marriage! Being helpless when father-in-law decided.. ..to mortgage the house, Bulti came to me and cried. Stop this marriage, sister-in-law. My brothers will become homeless, they will suffer. You stop this marriage! Father-in-law's despair, Bulti's cries.. ..didn't reach anybody's ears, sister-in-law! Only Saheb heard, so he solved everything in this way. One request to you all. This news shouldn't reach father-in-law's ears. Have this much pity.. you all have this much pity on me! I came down to know if you've returned or not, daughter-in-law. If I didn't, you'd have hidden Saheb's matter from me, right? Forgive me, father-in-law.. forgive me! Will you take me to him, daughter-in-law? They won't allow to meet Saheb now, father-in-law. I will take you tomorrow morning. Tomorrow morning? Won't it be too late? - Father-in-law! I will go tomorrow morning, do take me. Don't forget to take me. No, father. Tomorrow morning you, I.. we all will go. No, daughter-in-law. Why we all? Why would they go? In return of a part of his body Saheb has relieved his poor.. ..father from the responsibility of his daughter's marriage. It's only my responsibility, I am indebted. What responsibility do they have? Only you and I. Only you and I. Well, daughter-in-law when I'll meet him, I.. Can you say what should I do? Should I say thanks to him because.. ..he relieved me from the responsibility? Or should I bless him? Or should I greet at his feet? Don't even think of that, father-in-law. Saheb will suffer! - Why will he suffer? Why? It's mentioned in history, when Lord Buddha became ascetic. And came to meet his father, wife and son for the last time. Then king Shudodhon greeted him at his feet. Then why won't I be able to? Sleeping person shouldn't be greeted at feet, father-in-law! Oh, so Saheb is sleeping? Okay all right, then I will wait. When he gets up.. Come on, father-in-law I'll take you to the room. I am able myself, daughter-in-law.. I am able. I've not broken down. You know, daughter-in-law, my Saheb used to.. ..satisfy hunger by eating everyone's leftovers. Everyone used to hate him so much. Did I scold him any less? I told him that when the whole team runs with the ball. Strikes goal, gets applauded. Then you.. you stand behind everyone in the.. ..goalpost and enjoy the breeze. Worthless, good for nothing. That worthless goalkeeper, daughter-in-law.. It's true that he didn't strike goal. But he defended goal and got my team victorious. Saved a family from getting doomed. Daughter-in-law, where.. where is my Saheb? Wipe your eyes, father-in-law. There.. there is my Saheb, my brave son. Please, you people leave. Come on, father-in-law. When will he regain sense, Dr. Banerjee? Doctor, he'll survive I suppose? We are trying our best. Please, you people leave now. Okay if we sit there and wait? We'll remain absolutely silent, won't speak even one word. I'm sorry, it's not allowed to sit there. If you want to wait then you can sit.. ..in the visitor's room down stairs. Saheb will be alone here in the cabin.. ..and we there downstairs.. If you can't permit me, at least, let her. I told you, it's not allowed. Doctor, when a child gets up from sleep and.. ..doesn't find the mother he cries bitterly. When Saheb will regain senses.. ..and he won't find daughter-in-law.. Please.. please, doctor.. please.. 'Sir, come inside for once.' He's coming to sense. Saheb. Saheb. Saheb. 'Saheb.' For this you touched my feet and took the blessings? For dying? Why do you have so much enmity with me? Why crying, hopeless? You've defeated all of us, you've won. Laugh, worthless.. laugh. 'Laugh, I say.'
