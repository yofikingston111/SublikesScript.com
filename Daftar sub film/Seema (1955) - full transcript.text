The bookie has said horse number 9 will win. Yes, if this house was mine, I would sell it too. But you don't worry, I'll be right back. I've found it. After so many days, I've at last found it. Why are you troubling me? What did you find? - A horse. - Horse? Are you crazy? We barely make ends meet and you want to bring a horse. No, I mean I've got two job offers. It was a slip of my tongue. Don't worry, our good times are ahead. I was struggling to get one job and now I've got two job offers. Thank God. Kashinath, come soon. I'm coming. Give me food. - Where did she go? - Gauri. You're still making the bread? Nothing is ready on time here. I'm losing the horse, I mean the job. If I'm even a minute late, I swear, everything will be ruined. She's useless. I'm screaming to serve the food... but she's working so slowly. - Listen... - I'm coming. - What is it? - Do you have some money? - For what? - For the taxi. - You're going to roam or to work? You don't know. If I go in a taxi, the boss will be impressed. These are the days of appearances. If you wear slippers and go, you won't get a salary of even 30 rupees. But if you sit in a taxi and go, you'll get paid 100 rupees. - But I don't even have a penny. - Gauri, did you get your salary? No uncle, I may get it this evening. But I need the money now. The need formoney arises in bad times. Come on Kashinath, we'll what happens. Uncle... your food. Oh no. I told you so many times not to call me when I'm going out. I'm going for a good work. Please bless me God. You've become so big but don't have any sense. He was searching for a job for so long. Today he got a job and he had to go without eating food. You called him from behind. When will you understand? I'm sick and you can't even make food on time. Why have we brought you up? To trouble us? I didn't know that uncle would leave so early in the morning. Do you ever know anything? The whole day you roam like a queen. Do you do anything else? Since you came here, we're facing problems. You won't be at peace until we're ruined. Curse the day we brought you here. We should have let you die there. Why are you standing? Won't you go to work? You want to lose that job? Go to work. Leave all this and go to work. Hurry up. - Gauri sister. - Sister has come. - Please tell us a story. - Not now, I'm going to work. You go everyday to work. Please don't go today. If I don't go to work, I'll lose my job. So what? Let it be. Let it be? There's no salary without a job and then no food. - Then no story? - Not now, when I return I'll tell you a story. Okay? - Okay. - Now go. Eight rupees and 2 annas. Is this the time to come? I come everyday at this time. What? Am I lying? You're arguing with me. I've kept you to work or to argue with me? I don't need such a girl. No madam. Please forgive me. I won't do this again. Fine. But if you do this again I'll throw you out. Understood? Your beautiful eyes... Don't worry. If you worry like that, your beauty will be marred. Our madam is a little mad. You also don't bother. Just ignore what she says. Oh my. Someone screamed at you and you're angry at someone else. The Banaras sweets are very nice. They're great. Have it. I swear, you'll become healthy. I swear, you look even more beautiful when you're angry. - Really? - I swear on you. Will you stop this nonsense? Else I'll go and tell madam. Why bring madam into it? The matter is ours. You don't know, I care for you so much. What did you do? What did you break? You broke the best teapot I had. You've spoiled the whole set. Your hands can only break. I'll give you to the police. No madam, please don't do that. I'll give you the money. You'll give the money for this? Do you know its price? Whatever you say, please cut it from my salary. Your pay isn't 100 rupees. To pay this you'll have to work for months. I'll work madam, but please don't call the police. Please forgive me. Ever since you came here, we've had problems. You won't be at peace until we're ruined. Curse the day we brought you here. We should have let you die there. Sister... Give me some food. - See, all pans are empty. - You ate everything, didn't keep for me? The pans are empty, my stomach is empty and so is yours. Today I'll tell you a nice story. Come on. Yes sister, tell us a story. Okay, sit down. Tell now. Please tell the story. Today I won't tell you the story of a king or a queen or a fairy. Today the story will be of... Hey, what happened to your doll? - Sister, the doll broke. - It broke? Okay, today I'll tell you the story of a small doll. Yes sister, please. Listen to a long story of a small doll The way the night hears the stars speaking Listen to the story of a small doll In her fate there was a bed of thorns and toys of tears Pain was her friend and her eyes had sorrow She didn't have a home or any other place She didn't have a home She had pain in her heart and hid tears in her eyes Listen to a long story of a small doll She wished for a small bungalow on the beautiful earth... where there would be games and nice meetings There would be nice meetings The childhood went and the tearful youth came Listen to a long story of a small doll A marriage procession with the queen and the king on the horse There are paths of love and flowers fall there And flowers fall there She wanted to become the queen of stars one day Listen to a long story of a small doll What happened after that? After that? In a moment her dreams broke. The light also diminished Only darkness and sad mornings were left This is the whole story, but yet incomplete It's still incomplete Even she didn't know what would become of her Listen to a long story of a small doll The way the night hears the stars speaking Listen to a long story of a small doll Did you get your salary? Why are you quiet? Say something. Where is the salary? I broke a teapot. I'm asking about the salary and you're talking about the teapot. - My salary was cut for that. - You go to wash dishes or break them? This girl has made our life hell. She goes out and causes loss for us and stays at home and devours our food. Oh God. Why did we get her? In this mess I don't think my work will be done. I'll come later. Tonight I'll put you out in the cold. Then you'll learn. Come on. What are you looking at? - I'm fed up with her. - What? We've done a lot for her. We can't keep her forever. She's not a child. She can take care of herself. We've brought her up. Now let her go where she wants. - You tell her. - Okay. Give the vegetable. Sister... I've brought food for you. Two breads and a little sauce. Please eat, sister. Baby, greet Gauri. You won't greet her? I'm feeling very bad that your salary was cut yesterday. Are you feeling okay? Oh my. This girl is like a thermometer. You look at her and her temperature rises. Don't worry about me, but take care of yourself. These fair hands aren't meant to wash dishes but to apply henna. If you behave like that, your life will be spent washing dishes. Just get married. I'll take you on the Frontier Mail to Delhi and Agra. I'll show you around. Are you going? Else I'll go and tell the madam right now... that you bother me and steal things. Where are you going? I'll go myself. But one day you'll think of me and regret. I'm telling you. Come my dear child. Where did your chain go? Banke! - Banke, where are you? - I'm here. Are you both deaf? Didn't you hear my call? Who took Shobha's chain? - What? - Tell or else I'll hand you both to the police. - Why are you screaming? - What to do? See, Shobha's chain is gone. - What? - She didn't go out of the house. Yes sir, she was here, playing with us. Madam, when I came here baby was playing with him. Wasn't she playing with you? Liar. He's a thief. I'm sure he's robbed it. Search him. Madam, she's calling me a thief. She's wrongly accusing me. Silence! If neither of you took the chain, where did it go? I'll call the police right away, and then we'll know the truth. The servant doesn't have it. Sir, you searched me. Now you must search Gauri, too. - Yes, why not? - Please search her. See, I don't have... - What's this? - Show me. - This is Shobha's chain. - How did it get here? Shameless. How did this chain come here if you didn't go near Shobha? No, I didn't rob the chain. I've never robbed. Then how did it come in your veil? I don't know inspector. Please believe me. I swear I've never robbed. I didn't steal this chain. - Come with me. - But I didn't take the chain. Believe me. I've never robbed. Madam please tell him, I've never robbed. The circumstances don't prove that the accused robbed the chain. Also, she's a minor and hasn't committed any crime before now. So on the assurance of one year's good behavior... promised by her uncle Mr. Kashinath, she's released. Auntie... I've returned. They released me. - I'll do it. - Move away! I won't let you work with the hands which rob. Why have you come here? Get out. - Auntie... - We're poor, penniless, your uncle doesn't earn... and I'm sick, but we never touched anyone's things. Auntie. I won't let the world raise a finger against us by keeping you here. Get out of my house and don't ever show me your dirty face again. Get out. Get out of here. Uncle... Where should I go? Where can I go? I don't have anyone in this world except you both. So what can I do? I saved you from being jailed. What else do you want? Uncle! In this house only your aunt has a say. I can't keep you here. No uncle, don't throw me out. Please have mercy on me. Don't throw me out. Why should we throw you out? We'll keep you here and pray before you. Get out. We've taken a lot of misery for you. You've defamed us in the village. Aren't you satisfied? What are you doing here? Get out or I'll hit you. Go. In a moment her dreams broke, the light also went out Only darkness and sad mornings were left This is the whole story, but yet incomplete It's still incomplete Even she didn't know what would be her end Listen to the long story of a small doll, like the night Listen, you wanted a maid. Here she is. What can you do? All the housework. Washing dishes and clothes, looking after the child. - What will you charge? - Just give me food, clothes and place to stay. Where do you live? I don't have a house. I don't have anyone in this world. - Where were you working before? - Before? At a rich man's place. - Why did you leave there? - What? They accused me of robbing. It was the mischief of their servant... but the police caught me. I explained to them I didn't rob. But they didn't believe me and convicted me. We don't need a maid. Please go. The laundry washes my clothes, food is from the hotel and I've no wife. Can you do anything else apart from housework? Take this. What's your name? Take this. Sir, this girl committed a theft and was just released by the police. Really? We don't give work to thieves. Go from here. This world is a carnival of sorrow It's the tale of problems Some cry, some sing This life is strange Please support us... Please support us as we're in need We're stars fallen from the sky Please support us If the stomach is full... If the stomach is full, the world looks bright When hunger torments, the conscience falters Please do good Please do good. This life is very short Please support us as we're in need We're stars fallen from the sky Please support us From your world... God, please tell us where should we go from your world? We're your children but we still suffer We may be poor... We may be poor, but we're your children Please support us as we're in need We're stars fallen from the sky Please support us What's all this? Old man, you want to pick pockets by gathering a crowd? Go away. - Okay, sir. - Go away, else you'll be dealt with. We won't sing, sir. Listen, take this. It was lying here. May God bless you. My God is dead. - Please give me this. - Take, sister. - All of you are here. - We've been waiting for so long. Many people wait for me and have gone crazy. Come. Banke. Gauri, you? When did you come back? I'll tell you. Ask your friends to go. Yes, if you sinsist, I'll expel them from the city. Brothers please leave. Come, please come. Please come. Come. All morning I've had an odd feeling. It was because you were coming. The truth is, I was praying for you. Thank God you weren't jailed. I was saved from being convicted, but the crime I'm accused of... is haunting me. People think I'm a thief and call me a robber. People are fools. What do they know? Uncle and auntie have thrown me out of the house. I have no home now. What are you saying? And there's more. I've been looking for a job... but all doors are closed to me. Do you know, I haven't eaten for two days? For two days I haven't eaten a piece of bread. Are you happy? You haven't eaten in two days and you think I'd be happy? Okay. But do you know who's responsible for this? You. You've misunderstood me. You don't know how much I care for you. Please listen to me. Sit here. I'll bring food for you right now. - Food? - Yes. I won't have poison brought by you. Okay. But think with a calm mind. Your uncle has thrown you out. No problem. Take this broken house as your home and stay for as long as you want. - Here? - Yes. - In this house? - Yes. You ruined my life. Will I stay in your house? Rogue! You're getting angry for no reason. Please listen to me. I made a mistake once but I'm not like that now. You're a scoundrel. A rogue. If you think I'm a scoundrel, a rogue, then beat me. Beat me. I know Gauri, I know... because of me you had to go through a lot of trouble. You lost your job and your house. But Gauri... I'll get a job for you by this evening. Please believe me. Even a bad man has a heart. Yes, Gauri, please sit. There's nothing to eat at home now. But I'll get it right now. Till then you sit here. I'll get food for you. There she is constable. I'm not lying. She's holding a club in her hand and waiting still. I'd informed the police about the theft she committed. That's the reason she's waiting to beat me. I'd have argued if it was a man. Unfortunately, she's a woman. You may confirm it with the residents, if you aren't convinced. - Am I telling a lie? - Not at all. - You cheat! You scoundrel! I'll kill you! - Stop it. - Move, I'll kill him! - She's beating me in your presence. - What are you up to? - I'll break your head. - Stop it. - I won't spare him. - Stop it. He's a rogue and a liar too. But you believe him always. You never listen to me. Whatever he says is the truth? And I only tell lies? I have neither wronged nor have I harmed anyone. But you did beat him mercilessly, didn't you? I'd have even killed him if I could. This scoundrel has ruined my life. I won't spare him. I don't care even if you send me to the gallows afterwards. Did you hear that? She dares to confess her crime. Good day, sir. What has this wretch done now? - She'd stolen a necklace last time. - Did you hear that? - Her own uncle accuses her. - Shut up, will you? - Yes sir. - You'd promised to take good care of her, right? - Yes, sir. - Why didn't you then? Are you aware she went to his house to beat him? Is that so? She'll ruin us some day. - Am I right? - Oh God. I suggest you take her home and take proper care of her. - Don't repeat this mistake again. - Alright. Beware. If you take her home I'll break your bones. I rescued her once, but I can't do anything this time. You're her guardian. Who will look after her now? To hell with her. She's not a child anymore. She can manage herself. - This wretch has troubled us enough. - That's true. I'm an indiscriminate woman, but you're rational people, right? Bankelal is a noble man too. Inspector... auntie may drive me away and so can uncle... and the whole world may disown me. Every dog has its day and so will I. I'll teach Bankelal a lesson that day. Alright. Don't act in haste. Calm down. Your uncle isn't willing to accept you. I don't want to live in his house either. I consider them dead. I'd prefer to live alone and die of starvation. But I won't rest in peace until I teach Banke a lesson. Did you hear that, sir? You don't seem to be normal. Hence I won't permit you... to move from this place. I'll have to make alternate arrangements for you. Kashinath, I'll try to get her admitted in an orphanage. I won't live in an orphanage. You cannot go elsewhere until this issue is sorted out, Gauri. You have no place to live. I'd advise you to live in the orphanage. Catch hold of her! Let me go! I won't live in an orphanage! - Let me go. - Set her free. Come here. This is her record. Seems to be a complicated case. You've a long tale to narrate, indeed. Come here. What's your name? He is Muralidhar, our friend. She's the superintendent of our hostel. We address her as elder sister. Are you annoyed? - Don't you like this place? - No. I don't like the place, either. I wish to leave the place. I feel like going to a more serene place. I wish I could climb a mountain and reach its peak. But I can't. There is sorrow all over the world. People aren't leading content lives. - We can't escape these things. - Don't give me advice! I haven't come here to listen to this nonsense. It's not nonsense. It's a fact of life. I've experienced it all and I've seen... the true colors of life as well. What's the punishment you'll impose on me? - Punishment? - Why have they brought me here then? - I don't know. - But I know very well. I've been deceived by several noble men like you. But now, no one can deceive me. - Not even you. - If you wish to be punished, you'll be punished. The first punishment will be that you go along with Didi... and freshen up and have breakfast... and then relax for a while. Don't worry about me. I've been leading... a peaceful life, all these years. Alright, freshen up first. - Let's go. - Move, I can walk on my own. Nonsense. Your ashram is a strange place and so are its residents. There are a variety of weird characters here. But this girl seems to be unique. She'll be very troublesome. Each one of them is troublesome yet I have faith in them. Aren't you aware that a lotus thrives in dirty water? And so does one find a diamond in a coal mine. Your efforts will be futile. You must take care for your health, at least. You're a heart patient. God forbid if something goes wrong. Don't worry, Murali. I'm perfectly alright. Don't panic. You must feel at home here. They're all your friends. You won't face any problems here. You sit here while I make arrangements for your food. Wow. Which crime have you committed? Wow. - Where are you heading? - Catch hold of her. - Why is there a commotion here? - That newcomer has fled. Stop! - Do you wish to escape? - Yes. Come with me. I'll help you escape. Catch hold of her! - What's the matter? - We were jogging. - He's lying. I wanted to escape, but he... - That's true. Every person is in a hurry... either to buy a house or to catch a train. Tenants, too, try to escape from the clutches of the owner. Some try to escape the rains... while some avoid the sun. But their motive isn't clear. - I've to settle scores with someone. - Settle scores? - What sort of scores? - I can't tell you about it. This is no jail. It's your home. You're free to do anything you please. But there are certain rules and regulations you can't disobey. Promise never to escape. I won't promise. Alright. Instead of making false promises, it's better you not make any at all. - Sir. - Don't panic. Everything is alright. Relax for a while. You'll have peace of mind. Keep watch. Thank God I met her. Else she'd escape. A person tries to escape when he is overwhelmed by problems. You're absolutely right. Nonsense. What's all this? I asked her to bathe, but she smeared my face with this instead. What's all this? You're being rude. By all means. I don't fear him. Drag her. Wow. This new girl is a nuisance. First she tried to escape and then poured boiling water on the warden. I wonder what's wrong with her. Circumstances change a man. People compel them to resort to rude behavior. But nobody troubled her here. Why is she behaving abnormally then? Abnormal? Let me ask you a question. Your parents would have nurtured you with love and care, right? But just imagine what you would go through... if you were deprived of parental love and affection? What would you do if you were treated like a slave... a slave in your own home? Here's her record. It's mentioned that she stole a necklace... but she denies it. - I wonder what the truth is. - If she continues to behave like this... other girls may be influenced by her, too. What are we here for then? Every individual passes through this stage in life. It may either mark the beginning or the end of one's life. This girl, too, is facing a similar situation today. She's reached a periphery of life and death. She may be reformed if we try to help her, perhaps. But if we refuse to help her, her life may be ruined. I don't want that. I'd like her to stand on her own feet again. Call her. I've received yet another complaint against you. Is it true that you poured hot water on her and tried to beat her? - Yes. - Why? She wanted me to bathe in her presence. She refused to move. It was her duty to do so. I didn't expect this from you. - I thought you were a good girl. - Now you know I'm bad, right? Dismiss me then. Set me free. You won't move. In fact you'll live in seclusion henceforth. You'll live alone. You won't be allowed to meet anyone. No one will speak to you, either. - Take her away. - Let me go. You'll regret your decision. Let me go. You're an ocean of love We crave for a drop of love Return whatever is due to us Else we'll leave the world You're an ocean of love This crazy mind... craves for freedom Desires are naive... but the path isn't clear Please guide us We'd forgotten the path You're an ocean of love. We crave for a drop of it On one side is life We're confused... as to which side the periphery lies Please whisper to us We must choose You're an ocean of love We crave for a drop of it Wow. Don't worry. I won't harm you. Friend. May you be rid of the evil spell cast on you. You seem to be a snob, but I love such people. - Have you been trapped for the first time? - I'm not trapped. I, too, denied the fact when I wronged for the first time. - Understand? - I'm not a thief. - I haven't done anything. - Calm down. It tends to happen with beginners. Don't worry, I'll train you. I'll train you in a such a manner that you'll be an expert. What's your opinion? Wow. Strong arms indeed. You mustn't attack anyone by slapping them. You must use your fists. You wretch. What are you up to? Let me go. You wretch. - I won't spare you. - How dare you beat me? Slowly. It hurts. Alright. I accept defeat. Shake hands. What's going on here? - A tiff. - A tiff? We had an argument and then it grew into a fight. - We're trying to compromise now. - Get out of here. - Why'd you throw away the food? - I don't want your food. You may take it away. - What's the matter? - Gauri's not been eating since yesterday. - We tried our best. - Is she ill? - No. She's perfectly alright. But she refuses to eat. I'll try. I heard you haven't eaten since yesterday. What's the matter? Why are you starving yourself? You mustn't behave this way. You aren't a child any longer. Get up. I'll get annoyed if you don't eat. Come on, get up. I may have to use force, if you refuse to eat. I'll send you to a hospital forcibly... where you'll be compelled to eat. We'll wait and see. You're stubborn indeed. She's very adamant. We must feed her forcibly. We have no other option. There's a solution to every problem, doctor. Give me the plate. Look dear. Your elder sister is starving. Will you go and feed her? That's a good girl. I've brought food for you. Please have it, sister. Please have it, sister. I've brought food for you. Please have it, sister. Please have it, sister. Get out of here! Calm down. I'll have food. Stop crying. Stop crying, I'll eat food. Look at me. Stop crying dear. I'll have food. Look at me. Stop crying dear. I'll have food. Look, I'm having food. I'll have food. Look at me. Don't get annoyed over trivial matters Don't waste your energy Life is colorful. Don't brood over your fate Don't get annoyed over trivial matters You lack lady-like qualities You have suppressed your true feelings Every morn is a new one One must live irrespective of joy or sorrow People are willing to share one's joy... but not one's sorrow You must face sorrow alone Don't get annoyed over trivial matters Don't waste your energy Life is colorful. Don't brood over your fate Great. - What happened? - Save me sister. What happened? Who hit you? - My husband. He'll kill me. Please save me. - But where is he? He's drunk. He doesn't go to work. I sold all my ornaments... gave him everything. He asked for food. There's nothing at home. He hit me. He always beats me. I won't go back. Please save me sister. Don't be afraid. You're safe here. - What's your name? - Radha. - Call the doctor right away. The superintendent was praising you. I feel you can stay in the hall with the other girls. Thank you. - Are you happy? - Yes. - Very good. - Please listen. What is it? Now I follow the rules of the home, live properly. May I go out now? Yes why not? But not alone. I'm not scared of going out alone. I promise I'll come back. But why do you want to go out? It's a personal reason. I can't say anything. But we should know where you want to go and why. I have to deal with a man. This home is like your house. Every house has its rules. As we don't break house rules, you mustn't break the rules of this home. I'm afraid I can't permit you to go out alone. But I'll tell the superintendent to keep you in the hall henceforth. - Your work can be done. - What do you mean? You want to go out. He won't permit it and I'm here. Understood? Com back soon. Okay? Sister. Where did sister go? - What happened? - Where did sister go? - What happened? - Where did sister go? - She'll be here. Sleep with me. - Sister. - You go to sleep. She'll come soon. - No. I want sister. - No. I want to sleep with sister. - Quiet. Who's that? - You? - Yes, it's me. - Do you recognize me? - What are you saying? How can I forget you? Good. I, too, haven't forgotten you. It's a small world and we will see each other. - It's good, isn't it? - Yes. But how did you come here? I've come to repay you. - Repay? - Yes. - Me? - Yes. - What repayment? - This. - What are you doing? - Won't you go to get food for me? - I'll go right now. - Will you? - I'll go now. No. Enough Gauri. Please stop. It's enough. Please listen to me. I'll do whatever you say. Can you take back the defamation I've got? Can you remove the tag of a thief given by you? Can you give back my respect? Can you make my home again? Rogue. Scoundrel. I beg of you. I touch your feet. Please leave me. - Sir, Gauri ran away. - Ran away? How did this happen? - How did she get out? - Maybe she climbed the wall. Climbed the wall? This is very bad. - We must call the police. - No need to call the police. - She'll be back. - Did she go for a walk that she'll come back? She won't return. She'll come. I know she'll come. I know it. Where are you going? There's bondage inside and freedom outside. You're free. You can go where you like. This chance won't come again. There's still time. Run away. Oh wanderer, where are you going? There's darkness in your life. First light a lamp Oh wanderer, where are you going? The journey of this life is unknown It's easy to go astray. There's fear of being lost We may want it, but the heart is not at peace Oh wanderer, where are you going? The one who doesn't fall, never wins The one who falls and walks again is the victor Make the wounds of your feet the strength of your heart Oh wanderer, where are you going? Did you ever think where your destination might be? In this big world, where is your home? Why did you break the relations you made? Oh wanderer, where are you going? Call the police. Where did you go? - I've come back. - But you were told not to go out. - I had promised to return. - But why did you go when I had refused? Do you know the time? - But I've come back. - That doesn't mean you're right. - Where did you go? - To meet a dear friend. - Which friend? - His name is Bankelal. He worked with me. He's a cook but his real work is robbery. He lives near the station. Enough, or do you want to know more? Yes. Why did you go to meet him? - I had to repay him. - That's what I want to know, what repayment? - I won't say. - Really? You couldn't have gotten out of here by yourself. Who helped you? No one. I went alone. If you tell the truth, I'll forget what you did. Else you'll be punished with that room and no meeting with anyone. You can give me any punishment. I don't care. Okay. You may go. - Sir, I helped her. - She's lying. I'm telling the truth, I helped her to go out. You're saying this to save me. Only I'll get the punishment. Tell him you didn't help me. - It's not good to hide the truth from sir. - But it's not the truth! Take her. You can't punish her. You'll regret it if you punish her because of me. You can't do what you want. I won't let you do it. You can't punish her. I'm very happy, you spoke the truth. But you shouldn't have helped her. I know. Please forgive me. Okay. You may go. Gauri's past has been awful and it has affected her. We'll need to take care of her. Keep her alone tonight in the room. We'll see in the morning. Gauri went, Putli went, sister went but you're still here. Stop worrying and take rest. - Brother. - Yes? - Come on. Come on. Sir said to keep you here tonight. It's only for tonight. Yes. I know everything. I've gone bad again. I've made another mistake so I must be punished. I must be separated from the other girls so they don't become like me, right? Don't think that. Stay here tonight. It'll be fine in the morning. Please understand. Aren't you a nice girl? Yes, I'm very nice and I'll be better than this. I'll be so nice, he won't keep me here for long. Understood? - Why are you here? Go away. - Okay, fine. What are you doing? Come inside. Come in. Everyone wants to come in. Come. Come inside. - Sir. - What is it, Putli? - Gauri is creating havoc. - What did she do? - She was put in the room alone, as you said. - Yes. - But since morning she's breaking things. - Really? She broke the bed and glasses, tore the mattress, doesn't let anyone in. Murli, I can see hope for her now. The guilty take punishment quietly but the innocent act against it. Yesterday Gauri went to Bankelal's house. He works at the same place where she was caught for robbery. Okay, but what's the link between Gauri, Bankelal, glasses and hope? It's there. Go and find out why Gauri went there. If you need to, take police help. Go right away. Okay. If you say, I'll go. Putli, please get my coat. Mr. Ashok, you can't go. You must not go there. I know it's your duty to care for me... but it's my duty to care for them. You're my doctor; I'm their doctor. - I'm sorry, I had to trouble you. - No problem. Open the door. She's mad with anger. She hits whoever goes in. She throws things at that person. She's in a mad fit. - Don't worry, open the door. - No sir, please don't go in. Sir. Sir? Great. You have a good voice. You sing very well. Carefully, it may fall on your feet. Why are you standing? Sit down. - Where? - Oh yes. You've really changed the decor of the room. You've worked very hard. Right? - Because I was very angry. - I can see that. - What punishment will I get now? - A very big punishment. - What? - You'll have to sing again that song you were singing just now. - Song? - Yes. - I don't know how to sing. - You sing well. Didn't anyone ever tell you that? Anyway, no problem. Now I'll break the glass and you sing. What are you doing? You're breaking the glass. - Am I breaking the glass? - Please, I don't know how to sing. You know how. If you don't sing, I'll break the rest of the glass, too. Listen. I'll sing. Okay, sing. But not here. Please take me outside. Okay, come outside. Come. Can you sing here? Come on, sing. Yes. Okay, start. My darling lied to me He lost but doesn't admit it My darling... My dear claimed to be a great player My dear claimed to be a great player but turned out to be ignorant He cheated but yet is angry with me My darling... My darling lied to me My darling... Your talks, oh Krishna... Your talks, oh Krishna, make me anxious Your taunts make me restless My darling... My darling lied to me Very good. I knew you sang well but I didn't know you sang so well. Hearing your song, I'm very happy. You don't know what you are. The diamond doesn't know it's worth. Come on. Sit. This window glass is strong. Don't break them. Please forgive me this time. I'll never do it again. I'll be good, I promise. Very good. I expected this from you. Because I know you may break all the rules, not obey me... but you'll never break your promise. I know that. Gauri, there's one more thing. I was thinking about Bankelal. In my opinion, you didn't steal that chain. Am I right? Great. What a den. The rich must have lost everything here. - Do you know whose den this is? - Whose? - Mr. Bankelal's. There were many Banke's in Lucknow. No one can match their style. So this is Bankelal. But who spoiled his looks? - Sir. - Yes? The looks haven't been spoiled, but have been made. Have been made? Are you in love? Who is that Juliet? Great name. - Pehelwan! - Yes? - Lower your voice. Okay. But tell me, why did she hit you? Let me become first. Then I'll deal with her. She's acting too smart. - I got her into trouble once. - What did you do? I tied a chain to her veil. She was saved and was mad at me. She's a woman, so I spared her. You did the right thing but... That's an old story. Let's gamble. Who knows when you'll come again. - Should I come? - Yes. Come on. I'll open the door. You go. Go now. Hey pals. The police are here. - Hey, run. - Wait here. Search everyone. - What's all this? - We didn't do anything. Banke called us here. - They came to mourn my father's death. - Shut up. - Okay, sir. Inspector. This stuff was there. - Whose ornaments are these? - My wife's. - Where's she? When did you marry? - She died before the marriage. - Silence! - Yes, sir. Sir, all these were stolen by Bankelal. We aren't responsible. Quiet! The court will decide that. No one must try to escape. - Mr. Bankelal. - Yes? Every dog has his day. Please go to jail. You'll have a nice time there. Sister, why has he called me? - Go in. He'll tell you. - But did I do something wrong? You'll know soon. Bankelal has been arrested. Many things were found at his place. He also admitted that he tied the chain to your veil. Now we have the proof of your innocence. Take, read it. - I don't know how to read. - This means you're free now. - Free? - Yes. Now you can go from here. But where should I go? I have no home. I have no one. Please let be stay here. You need help for the home. I'll do the work here. Sister, please tell him to let me stay here. - Let her stay here. - Stay here until we find a good home for you. Thank you. Don't break the glass. It's very expensive. Eight rupees and four annas for a dozen. Yes, I mean no. Listen... Murlidhar did all this for you. You must thank him. I don't want any thank you. She must thank you... because you gave the idea and I acted on it. The soldiers fight the war but the credit goes to the captain. What do you feel, Gauri? You're all great. I'm very small. I can't say anything. Whatever you did for me... Listen everyone. What happened Gauri? This is a long story. - Whose story sister? - The story of a small doll. - Please tell me. - You'll listen to it? - Yes. Listen to the long story of a small doll The way the night hears the stars talking Listen to the story of a small doll Happiness came with a breeze, on the path of love The clouds of sorrow have gone, revealing a beautiful moon The spring came and danced with joy And it danced with joy The stars smiled and the seasons of happiness sparkled Listen to the long story of a small doll The way the night hears the stars speaking Listen to the story of a small doll The dreams and wishes at last came true The world is unknown but everyone seems nice The sighs became songs and the paths opened And the paths opened This is the story of life and the tale of the heart Listen to the long story of a small doll The way the night hears the stars speaking Listen to the story of a small doll - Greetings. Are you the matron of this home? - Yes, tell me. A girl named Putli stays here. I'd like to meet her. But why? What business do you have with her? I'm a relative from her village. Her old mother is very sick. She has sent a message for Putli. If you permit, I'll meet her. - Your name? - My name is Chandulal. - Wait here. - Okay. - I'll get her. - Fine. Great. Putli, come right away. What are you doing, Chandu? I came to see you but got this. See the amount of money. - Put it back. - What do you mean? I mean you can't take this money. Put it back or I'll scream. Don't get mad. We won't have this chance again. You'll get half of it. This is money for the poor of this home. You can't take it. - Don't behave like a saint now. - Put it back or I'll kill you. Look at yourself first before telling me. Wait Chandu! Sister! Sister, thief! - Move away. - Thief... - Catch him. - Thief. - Give me this. Sit down. To catch that thief you didn't bother even for your life. Thank God you're safe. But why did you put yourself in danger? Sir, I was a thief once. I, too, used to steal from others. But I didn't know what the person who lost his things felt. That I know today. When I saw him robbing... I felt as if he was robbing me. So I followed him. Sir, today I learned how wrong it is to be a bad person. Very good. I can't express how happy I am to hear this from you. But if something should happen to you? So what? The world would be relieved of a burden. You, a burden? We're proud of you. The home is proud of you. Not because you saved the money, but because today goodness has won. This is a victory for truth. Have a look. This is for you. - For me? - Yes. You can start your life again and be independent. Sir! - See what sir gave me. My own machine. - Yes, it's very nice. Yes, it's very nice. Before today I used to cut pockets. Now I'll try to stitch them. That's great. With this, my sins will be washed away. Right? Your sins are washed away with what you did today. Come on. - Where are you going? - I want to meet your sir. - You can't go in. - Where's your sir? - Watchman, leave him. Let him come. - So you're the one. - What business do you have? Where's my wife? - Your wife? - Yes. - What's her name? - Radha. - So Radha is your wife? - Yes. - She's here. - Call her. I'll take her home. - First, tell me, why did she leave you? - That's none of your business! Maybe it concerns your wife. When she came here, she was injured. You never took care of her, but you screamed at her and beat her. She's my wife. If I want, I can kill her! You have no right to keep her! I have the right of humanity. I've seen many like you. You're fooling people. Your home is a hoax. If you don't return my wife, I'll kill you. You want to kill me? Fine, kill me. My life isn't precious. If I die, no one will lose anything. If you think I've done something bad to you, you can kill me. Why are you staring? Kill me. You can fool the world with your speech, not me. You encouraged my wife, destroyed my home, I'll kill you. So, you think we've destroyed your home? But, do you know what she would have done, if she hadn't come here? - Who are you? I know everything. - You don't know anything. You're blind in anger. Come with me. See where your wife is and what she's doing. See these children? Can you any difference between them and other children? Aren't they too innocent, pure and decent? But there's a difference between them and other children. At their birth, their parents left them on the roads, in garbage... and left them at the mercy of their fate to suffer. Do you know why? Because they're a sign of the sins of their parents. Society calls them illegitimate. But society doesn't think the parents... are illegitimate, only the children. We keep these kids here to protect them from suffering. We make them aware, they too have a place and a right in the world. Who knows? Someday one of them may become a great human being... and pride of the nation. Come with me. - Kamla. - Yes? See this girl. She too is the wife of a respected man like you. Her husband left her in the care of a relative and went out for work. But that relative tried to rape her. To save her respect, this brave girl killed that man. She was arrested but the law wasn't blind... and proclaimed her innocent and set her free. But her husband didn't take her as innocent... and threw her out of the house. She came here looking for support. Do you know if she hadn't come here, what her condition would be? Come. See these photographs. See these brides. When they came here some were orphans, some widows or victims. Now all of them are married and are the respect of their families. See these young men. They have humanity and courage. They have accepted and given respect to the victims of society. I feel they're great. I've haven't made this home. You've made it! If there weren't people like you, this home would not be here. Please forgive me. I misunderstood you. I made a mistake. Get up. A man makes mistakes. But a human is one who regrets his mistakes. Sir. See who is here. Please come home. Please forgive me. This will give you sleep and you'll be fine very soon. But you'll need to rest for a few days. No work, do you understand? How is he? He's okay but he has heart disease. Anything can happen. - Sister. - Be patient. What can we do? Pray that he recovers soon. God can't do anything for him. God doesn't do anything for a good man. We'll be praying here and he'll die there. He doesn't need God, he needs a human being now. He needs us. Please let me go there. No Gauri, the doctor said no one can visit him. God and doctor can't save him. They can't do anything for him. You are the ocean of love We're thirsty for a drop of your love If you send us back thirsty... we will leave this world You are the ocean of love We're thirsty for a drop of your love You are the ocean of love The crazy bird of my affection... is eager to fly My wings are tender, my vision is blurred... and I've to cross the ocean Please make him understand... from where I had lost my way You are the ocean of love We're thirsty for a drop of your love You are the ocean of love You... - Yes. - How did you come here? - Walking. - What's the time? - Must be 1 AM. So I slept a lot. Yes, for 14 hours. Now how are you feeling? I'm fine, absolutely fine. Please don't get up. Stay here. I'll be right back. Thank you. - Where did you go? - Nowhere, just to thank the doctor. Where is everyone else? No one was here. Murli uncle is sleeping in the other room. You were sitting here alone? You were here with me. Did you run from the home and come here? - You broke rules of the home again. - I always do it. It's nothing new. Go back right now. - Is it your order? - Think it is. I won't go. I won't obey this order. I obeyed your orders. Now you'll have to listen to me. No! Please let me stay here. I have no one in this world. No one loves me. Everyone discards me. Please don't discard me. Let me stay here. I'll not trouble you. Wake Murlidhar. He'll take you to the home. Come here. Sit down. Gauri, I know how much you care for me. But for me, there's not much difference between life and death. - Your life has just started. - But what have I done? You didn't do anything. But Gauri... every girl needs a home. She needs a home to call her own. - She needs support. - Yes. I understand. And I know, where my home is... who my support is... and for whom I have to live. You don't know anything. You're taking death as life. You want to make a home in ruins. You've gone mad. Please don't get up. Please lie down. If you cared for me you would never think or say this. I want to make your life and you want to destroy it. Is that it? - What's happening to you? Please don't worry. Lie down. - No. Unless you take back your words, I won't be at peace. I'll do whatever you say, but for God's sake lie down. Please sit down. You're ignorant. Very ignorant. Sit down. You care for me a lot. Do you want me to recover soon? Yes. Then will you listen to me? I'll do whatever you say, but first you get well soon. I'll do what you say. Do you promise? Yes, I promise. Then get married to someone. Settle your home. Marriage? Home? Yes, Gauri. You faced a lot of problems. You've suffered a lot. Now you need a home... where you'll find happiness and joy... and life. Please agree, Gauri. What is it brother? - Come right away. - Coming. - What happened? - I've found the man I was looking for. - Who is he? - You. Me? But I was here. Did I do something wrong? No, you did nothing wrong. I blundered. You're always with me but I didn't think of this before. - Think of what? Please say. - Don't hurry, I'll tell you. - Didn't the doctor say that I need rest? - Yes. - And you all say I should leave for a few days. - Right. So I've decided to go. Very good. You want me to come with you. I'll pack things, we'll go... No. I'll go alone. - Alone? Then why did you call me? - Listen, Murli. There's very important work for you here. You'll have to stay here, for me. Nonsense. I won't let you go anywhere alone. Tell me the work. - You know Gauri. - Very well. - She's a nice girl. - Yes, she's a very nice girl. She's faced a lot of problems in her life. Now she needs a home. She needs a husband. I wanted to say the same. Take Gauri with you. I'll make arrangements for the marriage. Don't worry. Don't be absurd! I'm asking you to marry Gauri. Me marry Gauri? Have you gone mad? No, Murli. What I'm saying is right. You have to settle down, too. Gauri will be a nice wife for you. - I know her. - I know her, too. Before marrying me she'll commit suicide. Suicide? Why? Why? You know the reason why, and even I know it. But she's promised me. You can compel her to promise you anything. But I know where her heart lies, who she lives for. Wrong. She's innocent. She doesn't know what's good or bad for her. If she's faltered, it's our duty to guide her. If you forcibly marry her with someone, her life will be destroyed. No, you're wrong! I'm always wrong, but this time you're wrong. Please try to understand me, Murli. I understand Gauri's feelings. And I'm neither God nor a stone. I've thought a lot about this. But I have to do what's good for Gauri and the home. That's the reason I've asked you, brother. If I know she's in the right hands, I'll be at peace. - Now my peace is in your hands. - Brother... You call me a brother and think of me as an elder brother. Can't you do this much for your brother? You've given life to many people. You've taught them to live and now you want to run away from life? Yes, I want to run away. I can't fight with life anymore. I've lost completely. I've lost. Okay. I'll make arrangements for you to go. But, you didn't answer my question. If you're happy with my consent, it's a yes from me. Why are you so sad? Now you should be happy. You'll have a home. You'll be happy and content. Murli is a nice man. He wants to see you. Shall I send him in? I've brought gifts for you. Gifts are useful in marriage, engagement, birthday, festivals... or to please someone. They're very useful. Gauri, but... It's all nonsense. See I've brought ornaments and clothes for you. See Gauri... I'm talking and you're standing quietly. What does this mean? - What do want me to say? - I want you to say a lot today. Sit down. Whatever I ask you, answer yes or no. Understood? - Do you know your marriage is fixed? - Yes. - Do you know with whom your marriage is fixed? - Yes. - So are you happy? - Yes, I'm happy. Aren't you ashamed to say that? Have you forgotten everything? When your life was being destroyed, brother saved you. Today when it's the matter of his life and death... you're sitting here, getting married, you're happy. But this is his order. You've never obeyed his orders. Why obey them now? Girls are strange. When you should have obeyed his orders you didn't. Now when you shouldn't obey, you say it's his order, his command. Did you understand what I'm trying to say? Listen, brother ruined his life for others. He worked day and night for others. Now his health has deteriorated and he's leaving here. - Where? - I don't know, he didn't tell anyone. - Who is going with him? - He doesn't want to take anyone, not me, either. But it's not good for him to go alone. He must be stopped. What have I been saying for so long? You can stop him, bring him back... and save him. Tell me, is this my duty or yours? - I can give my life for him. - Then go now or else he'll leave. I brought this for you. Take it as a gift from your elder brother. - Where's your sir? - He's gone out. - Where? For a walk. He said he wanted to see the sea before going. - He's been out for a long time. - Long time? - Yes. Yes. What happened? Nothing. I was feeling dizzy, so I came here. - But how did you come here? - You were going, leaving me alone. - So did you... - Yes, I didn't obey your order again. - But you promised. - Yes I did. But you're my life. Understood? - Listen... - No, I won't listen to anything. You'll live a hundred years. Now no one can take you away from me, not even death. Come back to that path of life, which you showed me. Now there's no limit before us. Get up.
