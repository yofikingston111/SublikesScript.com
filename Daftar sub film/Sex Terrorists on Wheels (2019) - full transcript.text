(Birds chirping) (Driving rock music) - [Tim] Okay, I told you, this is the last time. - [Debi] That's what you said the last time. - I know, but things have changed. - I'm going to have your baby. - This one last time and we'll be able to put some money in the bank, and settle down, and raise it right. - Tim darling, I love you. (Engines revving) - [Jezebel] Hey Tim. - Who the hell are you? - [Jezebel] I'm jezebel. - Well where's Tina? - [Jezebel] Aw, she couldn't make it. - Well I don't like it. - Nyeh nyeh nyeh, you don't like money? - [Jezebel] What do you want? - What do you have? - Well, I've got some weed, some speed, some acid, some x, some nice heroin, ooh, and some bomb-ass coke. - I'll take it all. - Huh? Oh, well, that'll be, eight, no, uh, carry the one, uh, nine, eight, 98.50. - No, I said, I'll take it. I'll just take it. - I don't know who the hell you think you are. - I told you, I'm jezebel. - God, dammit! - No! (Grunting) (Grunting) - And this is my gang. - It's my gang. - Who the fuck are you? - Why I'm lobo the wolf, and these are my sex terrorists. You've probably heard of us. - [I'im] What do you want? - Oh, just the usual, my friend, just the usual. (Whip cracking) - What the fuck? - You weren't supposed to hurt him. - He looks scared to me. - All right, boys, I'm in a generous mood. Who wants to go first. - I want to trip with this bitch. - Ha, ha, you'll fly so high you may never come down. - You're going to enjoy this. Go for it boys. Faster! Harder! Deepen I love raiding. (Screaming) - Not as much as she does. What good is that if he's bald, baby? - It'll make a nice purse. (Whooping) - That's why you're my number one warrior. - You want to bet? (I'im screaming) - Oooh. (Debi screaming) All righty boys, we've had enough fun. It's a long way to Esperanza. (Driving rock music) - It's my turn, baby. - All righty. Light 'em up. (Spitting) (Laughing) (Light acoustic guitar music) (Spitting) - Good morning Ralph, you're up awful late this morning, aren't you? A night of debauchery at your age? You look like you could sleep one off. Okay, see you later. How are you this morning, bennie? I slept very well, thank you. I know, bennie, it's tough being a kid. There's some things you're going to understand a whole lot better after you're all grown up. Well, in your case, you came from an egg. After your mama and daddy did something called mating, she laid you. Hello Max, old buddy, what's up? (Mysterious orchestral music) I told you to stay away from them. We'll look and see. (Driving rock music) (Suspenseful guitar music) - I don't know what's wrong with her. Seems like she only wants to fuck you. - That woman was born mean. Just like me. Besides, I don't have to settle for one woman, I'm a fucking warrior. And you don't want to piss off a comanche. - She ain't comanche. - I'm 1/64th comanche. - You don't look comanche. - What are you, racist? (Laughing) (Growling) - Listen up. Tomorrow, we split up. We meet back at the hideout at sundown. (Light acoustic guitar music) - A ranger on foot's no ranger at all. - It was your negligence that allowed her to set us afoot, again. - Ah captain, she's a sneaky little bitch. That's why they call her the she beast of devil mountain. In doing your duty. - Uh, whenever I catch up with that sneaky little bitch... - Save your breath. It's a long way back to camp. - Who are you people? - Huh. Careful, gramps. You're like to get shot thataway. - Whoa there, Joe, hold on he looks harmless enough, an old man. I'm captain Isaac Burton. We're Texas rangers. - Rangers, afoot? - Unhorsed by that sneaky she beast of devil mountain. You haven't seen her around here, have you? - Can't say as I have. - We're far off our range, old man. - Where ya headed? - Back to base camp on devil's river. - [Joe] Now wasn't I saying the very thing? - Well, how far then? - You keep the rising sun on your left hand side till you get past the rockfall. Then you angle south of east till you cut the river. - No, you've still got a long ways to go downstream - [Joe] Ah, dammit. I've never been all the way down there. - Well, I guess we'll get back to moseying then. Thanks for the directions, old timer. - Good luck. (Hawk crying) (Driving guitar music) - [Joe] Well fuck me twice and call me Sally. If it ain't the she beast of devil mountain. Heh, heh. Naked. - And who are you? (Spitting) - I can see why they call you that. - And what name are you hiding behind this time? - Your mama's. (Driving guitar music) - I'll call you cunt. And now, I'm just gonna get me some. - What they hell you doing, Joe? Put your dick away. Who is this woman? - [Joe] Take a look. You won't believe it. (Driving guitar music) - I'll be damned, the she devil herself. - [Joe] Damn right, and butt naked. - We've been looking for you a long time, missy. - I'm not who you think I am. - Last I heard you were down in Mexico. You shoulda stayed down there. - It got a little too Mexican for me. - You're wanted by the law. So we have to take you in. - This is all a misunderstanding. - We'll take you back to base camp, - that's exactly what I want you to do. Take me back to the major. You're gonna get a surprise of your life. Maybe your last one, too. - Take care of her. Not like that. You, stand up. Get dressed. Cuff her. - Got a smoke? - [Issac] Sure. (Driving guitar music) Now march. - Whoa. Hey. - I won't look. - Where'd you come from, old man? - I live around here. - [Lobo] You stay out here all alone? - No, I have my friends, bennie and Max. - You got a name, old man? - They call me old Ezra. How bout you? - I'm lobo the wolf. - You're not a wolf, you're a human being. - Well, lobo the great. - What's so great about you? - I'm the president of a bad-ass biker gang. - What biker gang? - The sex terrorists. You've probably seen us on TV. - I don't watch TV. You shouldn't call yourself a wolf. Wolves are nicer than people. - Here I am, trying to take a nice little piss, and here you are, busting my balls. Why are you busting my balls, old man? - You are headed for the Eve of destruction. (Suspenseful guitar music) - That was yesterday. (Engine revving) - I sure will miss having you here, sweetie. - Me too, grandpa. I love the hill country, and I love you, but I miss my friends. - I know, sweetie. - My senior year is coming up. It's kind of exciting, and kind of scary too, you know? - I know, honey. But, you'll have a great year. - Oh, grandpa. - [Grandpa] Howdy, Richard. - Howdy. - I sure was sorry to hear about your mama. - Me too, Mr. Cox. - I appreciate that. She was 91 years old. She had a good life. - Yeah, but she was your mama. - Yeah, yeah. (Light guitar music) - What can we get you, Richard? It's on the house. - Aw, you don't have to do that. - I know, but I wanna. - Well, how about the brisket plate? - I'm sorry, we're all out of brisket. The pork loin's awful good today, really moist. - All right, I'll have that. - How 'bout the beans and potato salad? - I'm sorry, it's kind of late. We're all out of potato salad. - Hmm, looking foward to your potato salad. - In fact, all we have left is beans. - All right, I guess a double side of beans, then. - How 'bout a beer? - No, grandpa, that kind of gives me gas. - Uh, how bout a cup of coffee? - Now that sounds good. (Suspenseful guitar music) - Whisky for everyone. - Whisky for everyone, and a coffee. - Ah, actually, we were just closing. And built up a powerful thirst. Just one drink. I'll buy one for you, too. - I guess one drink won't hurt anything. - Yeah, one drink won't hurt you. (Laughing) - Ma'am. I'm sorry. There's no smoking in here. It, it's a city ordinance. (All laughing) - Yeah, one for you, too. - [Grandpa] Don't mind if I do. - What about the cowboy here? - No thanks. - How rude. I offer you my hospitality and you insult me. - Doesn't set well with me. - Cheers. (Upbeat jazz music) Amigo. We are still thirsty. Why don't you bring us the whole bottle? - [Grandpa] We were closing. - I come in here for a quiet drink, and here you are busting my balls. Why are you busting my balls, old man? - Here's my best shine. I've been saving it for a special occasion. - Well, this is it! - [Grandpa] I'm sorry, sir. There's no smoking in here. (Laughing) (Dishes clattering) Ooh, she looks like an angel, an angel with golden hair. (Suspenseful orchestral music) Why were you hiding this angel from us, old man? - This is Emily. - Oh, Emily, you look like something from a fairy tale. I think I'll call you rapunzel. - She's my granddaughter. - I bet her cherry ain't even popped. (Laughing) - I'll blow your brains out, you scumbag piece of shit. (Whip cracking) - All right, dirtbags, I've got the drop on you now. - Ooh, you do, you really do. And I know who you are. Sex terrorists. I've got papers on you. - And just who the hell are you, cowboy? - I'm Richard Cox, the sheriff of Esperanza county. - Wow! Do they call you dick? - Dick Cox? (All laughing) - Well you're along way from Esperanza, dick. - I'm taking you in. - Ooh, well, I guess this is it. I guess there's nothing left to do but surrender. (Whip cracking) You feel pretty stupid now, don't you, cowboy? (Suspenseful guitar music) - You'll have to kill me first. - You don't want to die. You want to drink. Go on, Richard, dick, Cox, whatever the fuck your name is, eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow we die. (Chuckling) What about you, rapunzel, are you thirsty? - She's not supposed to drink. She's under age. (Laughing) - Is there a city ordinance for that, too? - No, that's a state law. - That wasn't so bad, was it? Here, have another. (Laughing) - I'm begging you, let her go! - We're just dancing. Is that against the law, too? You must be one boring-ass grandpa if you're not even going to let us dance. - Why don't you show grandpa how to dance? - Now dance with your boring old grandpa. (Knife stabbing) - Emily, honey, I'll see you in heaven. - You're boring as hell. It's all right, honey, don't cry. Just relax and enjoy yourself. - It's time to pop that cherry, rapunzel. I'm an old cherry-popper from way back. (Laughing) (Growling) (Groaning) (Grunting) Yeah, get it boy, yeah. Yeah, whoo. That was some rock and roll right there. Good fucking show. Good show. - Goddammit, what is wrong with you people? - Wrong? - Yeah, you're fucking animals. You're picking on old men and little girls. - Cowards. - [Richard] You're a rotten bastard. I am a rotten bastard. But I have friends who aren't. And you cops pound on them just the same. I may deserve it, but they don't. Their only crime is the color of their skin. Black lives matter, bitch. - You're not black. - What are you, racist? (Gun firing) (Suspenseful guitar music) It's a long way to Esperanza. Let's roll. (Laughing) (Wolf howling) - [Joe] Captain, we've been walking from dark till dark. - [Isaac] I reckon you're right, for once. - [Joe] Well, this will do. - Nice. - I'm starving. - You don't expect to find anything edible in there, do you? - Well, found some jerky. Shit! This shit tastes like shit. - It tastes like liver. - I know. I hate liver. - Yeah, me too. Got another piece? - You know, this shit's probably like two hundred years old. - Yeah, I know. Want some more? Is there anything over there to wash this filthy taste out of my mouth? - Mezcal. That shit tastes like shit. Give me a swig. Nasty. - Ah, come one, give me some. Ugh, shit. - What about me? - Oh, you don't get any, bitch. - She's our prisoner, Joe. - I'll take care of her. (Pants unzipping) - Aw, come on, captain. I done walked all day, and I need me a little reward. And I want her tonight, for a belly-warmer. - Let him try. - You can try doing you duty, Joe. What do you think they pay you $11 a month for? - Wow, you take your rangering pretty seriously. Are you expecting a medal or something? - You want me to let him have his way? - Yeah. - Now way. You're wanted by the law, and we're doing our duty. - I told you boy scouts, I'm not who you think I am. (Engines revving) (Suspenseful guitar music) - [Isaac] We got company? - Bikers. - Bikers? - Yeah, fucking bikers. Five. No, six. - Hey, give me a weapon. We keep hearing about in the media. - I guess we'll find out. (Suspenseful guitar music) - Good evening, gentlemen. Make yourselves at home. I can see you already did. Find everything to your liking? Are you hungry? We have jerky. - Yeah, I hate to say it, but it tastes like shit. - Tastes like liver. - Naturally. - Who are you? - We're Texas rangers, and this woman is our prisoner. We thought this place was abandoned so we took shelter here for the night. Where are your horses? - We've been set afoot. (All laughing) - That sounds really ridiculous. - Look, we just want to stay the night, and then we're walking to camp tomorrow. - You're walking all the way the hell to the Texas ranger camp on devil's river? - It's our duty as Texas rangers. (All laughing) So who are you? - I'm lobo the wolf, and this is my gang. - And what are you doing here? - This is our hideout. We hide out in here. - So are you wanted by the law? (All laughing) - Of course we are. Hey, don't I know you from somewhere, bitch? - [Jezebel] You're looking at the she beast - I thought you were somewhere down in Mexico. - India. - India? What was that like? - Indian. How you liking it? - Pretty goddamn texan. - I know, right? - [Jezebel] The best country in the world. - To be buried in. - What's your hurry? - Yeah. - You people are so fucked. Are for interfering with a law enforcement officer doing his duty? (All laughing) - You heard him, guys, we're fucked. I guess there's nothing left to do but surrender. (Whip cracking) (Grunting) (Screaming) Look what you've done to one-eye. - I guess he's no-eye now. - Rape 'em. - Oh hell, you know I don't like raping men. - You're a sex terrorist. That's what we do. - Fuck, lobo, do I have to? - Here, try this. (Gong crashing) (Whip cracking) (Grunting) Whoo, how do you like that in your eye, cowboy, your nether eye? (Driving rock music) Why don't you join the party, baby? Oooh. Just rape her enough to let her know who's boss. I don't want her damaged. She's worth money. We'll sell her to the president. (Laughing) - Did you get hard? - I was fantasizing about you, about the last drop of blood oozing out of your mutilated corpse. - Aw, thank you, baby. - My god, I can't believe it of a white woman. - I'm on my period, bitch. - [Isaac] You're just as bad as the rest of them. - No, I'm the worst of all. - Now, what am I going to do with you two? (Chuckling) - Hey, that's not fair. I'm right handed. - Hey, sometimes life isn't fair, amigo. Okay. I count to three. May the best ranger win. - I can't do this. - [Lobo] One! - [Isaac] Joe, you're my partner. - Don't worry, partner. Three! - [Jezebel] Yeah, yeah, get 'em, get 'em! Whoo! - Yeah! - [Jezebel] Yeah, right there, right there. Yeah! Whip his ass! (All shouting) - [Lobo] Finish him! - Yeah, yeah, get 'em, get 'em, whoo! - I knew you had it in you. Yeah! - [Lobo] Doesn't that feel good? Yeah! (Laughing) (Whip cracking) (Guitar music) - Yeah! Bravo! Bravo. You are one hell of a ranger, a hell ranger! - I'd like to fuck him. What a waste. - Mr. Super badass ranger, we want to show you our respects. We are going to let you walk. The comanche walk! - [All] Comanche walk! - Yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi! - As a super badass Texas ranger, you must have heard of what comanche women like moonshine here did to the captive rangers in the old days. You see, moonshine likes to keep the old traditions alive. And I like that, because I'm really a traditional guy. - You rotten cowards are all going to hell. - Amigo, we come from hell. (Gong crashing) (Isaac yelling) (Jezebel laughing) Now, you can take your walk of fame. Your super badass Texas ranger walk of fame. (Laughing) (Grunting) (Laughing) (Suspenseful rock music) (All laughing) (Groaning) (Gong crashing) (Suspenseful guitar music) - Now you can be one-eye. - Ooh, that's gotta hurt. What a performance! You guys rock! - I want to grab that liver before the poison hits it. - Are you going to eat that? - Yeah. (Chuckling) - Let's make tacos. - Liver tacos? - No time for that now. (Sniffing) - Two dead rangers? Bad medicine. - We'll have to find a new hideout. Moonshine, grab the drugs and money. Let's roll. Hey, you forget something? - I'm gonna grab those other livers for the tacos. - You're gonna eat one-eye's liver? - I wouldn't want it to go to waste. (Suspenseful guitar music) - Crank, put the cuffs on this bitch. - Why me? - Because I'm the fucking president of this fucking outfit. - All right, all right. Be cool, baby, and you'll get to trip with uncle cranky. (Grunting) - Now that's a really big mistake, baby. - Anyone so much as move and I'll slit his throat. Gauran-goddamn-teed. - Fuck! - Take it easy, baby. (Driving rock music) - No, bennie, we're not the same, not exactly. Max and I are what you call mammals. Well, we have hair, and our females give live birth, and then they nurse their young. But don't you worry. We may be different, but we're all family. Actually, reptiles are kinder than people. (Engines revving) Damn. Come on, Max. We better go look and see. (Light guitar music) (Driving rock music) - There. - Shit. Outta gas. (Sniffing) - [Moonshine] This way. - Let's roll. - I don't know. This looks like a good place for an ambush. - Jezebel, honey, baby, sweetie, the last time I fucking checked, I'm the motherfucking president of this motherfucking biker gang. - Yeah? Well, look where you led us. - Moonshine, lead off. Let's roll. (Light acoustic guitar music) (Hawk screeching) (Suspenseful guitar music) I told you, baby. Big mistake, messing with my money. - Time for your golden shot, bitch. (Suspenseful guitar music) - Who the fuck is that guy? Let's get him. - I told you this was an ambush. We need to retreat. - I never retreat. - This is a tactical retreat. We'll find another way up there. - She's right, lobo. Circle around, outflank them. - Dynamite thinking, baby. Where the fuck is Larson? What are you doing? That guy was your friend. - He wouldn't want it to go to waste. (Grunting) - That things full of meth. (Grunting) - Yeah. - They're retreating, at least for now. - You just saved my life. Thank you. - You're welcome. - You must be an incredible marksman. That was one hell of a shot. - It was pretty nifty. Thanks. - You must have eyes like a hawk. - Well these old eyes aren't what they once were. (Light acoustic guitar music) - Why you're, you're blind. - I'm only blind in one eye. (Laughing) - Then how did you make that shot? - The wind told me. - You can talk to the wind. - Actually, I do have the eyes of a hawk. (Hawk screeching) - You can talk to a hawk. - I can talk to all animals. Easier than most people. I'm Ezra. - A minor prophet. - What are you doing out here? - I live here, nearby, on the mountain. Let's head that way. - How do you know which way? - Max will lead the way. (Light acoustic guitar music) I take it you're in some kind of peril. - No, they are, now. - [Ezra] What have they got against you? - [Enyo] Not much. I took their drugs and money. - [Ezra] Is that what you've got in the bag? - [Enyo] Yeah. - Well, you can stash it up here. Who are they? - A bunch of low-life losers born to die. They call themselves the sex terrorists. - Ah, I've heard of them. And did they, did they, uh... - Yeah, they lived up to their name. - Rotten bastards. So what are you going to do? - Get mean. And I mean dirty mean. Down and dirty mean. - You mean mad dog mean. - Exactly. - Not you, Max, you're a coyote. So what's your name? - Enyo. - That's unusual. - She was a Greek goddess of war. - I never heard of her. - She was only a minor deity. - Oh. (Engines revving) - There's only two ways off that mountain. I've been up there. - [Moonshine] His word is true. - Let's split up. - I ride with you. - No, I ride with him. - I was thinking about riding with old liver-eating Larson. - What are you, queer? - I'm thinking about it. It might be better than two evil bitches fighting over me all the time. - No bitch, fuck you. - Hey, hey, girls, girls, peace, take it easy. Now listen, you fucking bitches are forgetting who we are and what we're doing here. Number one, we're a biker gang. The sex terrorists, dig it? That means we get to fuck who we want, when we want. Number two, there's a couple of deadly motherfuckers up there. They know who we are, they know what we've done, and they've got my fucking money. Now get over there and guard that trail. Let's roll. (Engines revving) (Light acoustic guitar music) - With those yahoos out there somewhere, we'll make a cold camp. - Do you mind if I sleep here? - How could you even find your way out here? - Felix shows me the way. - What is with you and that snake? - He's the symbol of my people. - Aren't you scared of him? - Felix is my brother. (Light acoustic guitar music) (Snake hissing) - [Jezebel] Whoa, what are you doing? You're just turning him loose? - He will lead us to water. - And you can trust him. He's not going to run away? - [Moonshine] I trust him more than any human being. - Yeah, some people can be snakes. Like one son of a bitch I know. - Why do you let him get to you? - [Jezebel] I want him to want me. - He does. - Yeah, and everybody else. - So? - I want him to want only me. - That's not going to happen. This is lobo the great we're talking about, right? He fucks everything he sees. That's just how he rolls. - Yeah, I guess you're right. - You should open your eyes, girl, look around you a little more. - [Jezebel] I see what you mean. (Light guitar music) - I'm hungry. And moonshine's got the tortillas, so we can't make tacos. (Sniffing) - Hey, check it out. (Laughing) - I'm so glad you brought me here, Rita. - I'm so glad you're glad. I got some really great rock samples, too. - Oh yeah, me too. - This place was sacred to the comanches. - I know. - Yeah, me too. (Rumbling) It's so great the president opened it up for recreational use. - I know, who knew that camping could be so cool? - I know, right? (Laughing) Cheers. (Suspenseful guitar music) - [Lobo] Good evening, ladies. - Oh! - [Lobo] Sorry. - What, what's going on? - We smelled something yummy. - And we sure are hungry. - All we have is beans. - [Larson] We don't come empty-handed. (Suspenseful guitar music) - Got anything to drink? - Just margaritas. (Ice rattling) - [Lobo] Sounds like a party. - Ooh, what is that? - Liver. - [Lobo] Which one? - Crank's. - [Lobo] Where are you ladies from? - Alaska. - Alaska? What do you do there? - Save whales. - You save that needle? - [Larson] Yeah. - No! - Hey girls, let's trip. This is some bomb-ass shit. I mean dyn-o-mite, baby. (Screaming) (Suspenseful guitar music) (Light acoustic guitar music) - Thanks, Felix. I was getting thirsty. Um, yum. Nice and cool. I could use a bath. - Music, music bitches. (Crying) Dance, bitches. - Dance. - Yeah, dance. (Laughing) Strip. - [Larson] Hey! - I said strip! - Take it off. (Light guitar music) Take it off. Right. - [Lobo] That's it. - Nice tits. I'd like to bite 'em. Right. (Mysterious orchestral music) - Nice to meet you, Felix, I'm Ezra. That's right, you can't trust the spirit of jezebel. She's a human and you can't trust them. Oh, the other one's an Indian. Well, you can trust her. (Eerie ambient music) (Laughing) (Crying) (Grunting) (Crying) - Look at me. Look at me. (Grunting) (Guitar twaning) (Laughing) (Mysterious orchestral music) (Snake hissing) - Shit! - That's weird. - You saved my life. I owe you one, partner. - Maybe next time you save mine. - Let's camp here. (Light acoustic guitar music) What do we have to eat. - Mice. - That Felix killed? - Yeah. - You're eating a mouse that your coral snake poisoned. - Yeah, you want some? - No. - How 'bout a lizard? - No thanks. - How 'bout some grasshoppers? - Well, it's a new day. - And we're still not dead. - Got anything to eat? - Jerky. - What kind? - [Enyo] Good. (Groaning) - Did you sleep well, baby? - Mm, yes. That ground was kind of hard, though. Baby, I've always wanted to tell you something. - [Moonshine] What is that, sweetheart? - Never turn you back on a white-eye. - Ah, you bitch! (Suspenseful guitar music) (Grunting) - There's only room for one bitch in this biker gang. And now I fulfill my wildest dream. - Watch for me on the mountain, moonshine is my name, firewater is my brother, danger is my twin, I am the lizard queen, I will haunt your dream. (Grunting) (Groaning) - Well, that was fun. Now we have to get back to business. - Is there anything to eat? - Jerky. (Spitting) - Yeah. (Driving rock music) (Engine revving) - [Jezebel] You guys really made a mess. - What the hell are you doing here? - Looks like you had a party. (Light acoustic guitar music) You're not supposed to party without me. - Where's moonshine? - We threw a party. She didn't make it. - You bitch? (Gun firing) - What was that? - You fucking whore. - If you start walking now you might even make out of here alive. (Driving rock music) (Guns firing) - [Larson] Goddamn. We're unhorsed and set afoot. (Grunting) - I'm gonna kill that fucking bitch. - Are you sure you want to? She's a pretty good lay. - I'm gonna cut her cunt off and make a hat out of it. - That will look cool. Well I guess there's nothing left to do but start walking and try to stay alive. - Oh, brilliant fucking plan, genius, I never would have thought of that. But first I'm gonna kill that fucking bitch. - You know, I'm sick of this shit. You are not presidential enough. I'm out of here. (Growling) - Hey, there's only one way out of this gang, my friend. (Ominous percussive music) (Gun firing) (Yelling) (Grunting) (Yelling) (Grunting) (Laughing) (Grunting) (Screaming) (Yelling) (Grunting) Now you're out of the gang, sucker. And you can keep your stank ass liver. (Grunting) (Laughing) (Light acoustic guitar music) (Spitting) - [Enyo] How did you lose your sight? - Vietnam. I was an army ranger. When I got back to the states, they dropped me light a hot potato. The president wasn't very grateful for my sacrifice. - [Enyo] Some things never change. What was it like in nam? - It was a clusterfuck. One gigantic atrocity. The things I saw, (sighing) The things I did. I don't even know what the fuck I was doing over there, other than killing people. I did a lot of that. - That sounds exactly like Syria. - You were in Syria? - What was that like? (Laughing) Seriously fucked up. I don't know what I was doing out there, other than killing people, and I still don't. She's making smoke. She wants to meet. - I'll meet you at the devil's sinkhole. (Light guitar music) - Easy. Actually, I come in peace. - How come? And you come with me. - Me? - Yeah. You've betrayed too many people with too much money. They'll pay for your scalp, but they'll pay a lot more for you alive. - And you expect me to just tag along with you? - Yeah. Because I'm the only one with my finger on the trigger. - Wrong, bitch. (Gun firing) I'm a ranger, and I've been on your trail since San antone. (Light guitar music) (Mysterious orchestral music) - Yes, Daphne, you are my soul mate. But I am half-human and I have my needs. - I have to move quick to head them off. - I'll catch up to you later. - Hold it right there, lobo. You have no gang to back you up. It's just you and me now. - I told you it was a big mistake messing with my money, bitch. Now hand it over.

(Howling) (Choking) (Neck cracking) (Light guitar music) - I'm a rich bitch now. (Laughing) Men are all talk, aren't they? But women? Women are made for action. Those men you burned?

At the ranger camp on devil's river. - [Ezra] That's a long walk. - [Ezra] Oh, I'll just go back to my little piece of paradise. - [Enyo] You know what? If you don't mind, I think I'll join you. - What about the major and the ranger camp? - They can wait. I'm due a vacation. - How 'bout them? - Leave them as a warning to others. (Light guitar music)
