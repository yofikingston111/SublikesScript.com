I can understand these things by gazing at you. What were you dreaming of? Let me also know. You'll get jealous? I see. So you were dreaming about somebody else? That's nice. My wife has become a modern woman now. Doesn't matter.. doesn't matter, I'll reap the benefit. Is it? So, now time will stop for you? The train is at 7 o'clock. At least get up now, Mr. Vinod. - Bahadur, has the driver arrived? - Yes, madam. - Take sir's luggage downstairs. - Darling tea. Oh. - Good morning, sir. - Good morning. - Hey, listen. - Yes? - Keep the bag in front, not in the dickey. - Yes, sir. Darling, come on, hurry up. Won't the meeting be done by tomorrow? Possible. I may come back by tomorrow. - Father. - Mitthu, up so early? Are you ready already? I, too, will come to station. Oh, lovely. But I'm leaving in 5 minutes. I am the boarding champion. I'll be ready in half that time. - Bahadur, bring milk for my dear child. - Yes, madam. And this? Give me. You are just like Mitthu? Hasn't he become so smart? And tall as well. - Just like you. - What? Smart or tall? Of course. Mother, we'll watch Jango today. No, no, you go along with Sunil and Mani. - I don't want to watch Jango. - No, I won't take Mani along. Why? What's the matter? Fought again? - Yes. - What happened this time? Forget it, Mother. Mitthu, until you tell her, your Mother won't leave you alone. You know how much your Mother worries over such small matters. She worries needlessly. - Yes, tell me. - The same old thing, Mother. About the book? Did you apologise? He uses foul language. I won't apologise. No, Mitthu. You were at fault. - You'll have to apologise. - But, Mother he's such a fighter. Is it that right and wrong argument again? Mitthu, Mother will never give you any wrong advice. - You apologise, okay? - Okay. What cinema is Jango running in? - In Shri Cinema. - Shri? Years ago, we used to live in that neighbourhood. What terrible days we've spent there! Everyday, we had to deal with a new problem there. - Vinod, you remember the day, that south Indian.. - Meena, please. Is it necessary to remember the past? Forget it. "John Brown's body lies smoldering in the grave." "John Brown's body." It's very late. The train will just be leaving. You both return from here, I'll rush. - Bye, Mitthu. - Bye. - Bye. I'll come soon. - Come soon. Yes. "Drops will shower on every leaf." "Monsoon will swing on every branch." Bhajji, chop some more onion and chillies. "Monsoon will swing on every branch." "Rain will kiss thirsty lips." "Rain will kiss thirsty lips." - "Today, monsoon.." - Mother, a letter for you, two for Father. For me? Keep them in Father's room. "Today, monsoon will dance in the eyes." Call me when the chicken's ready. "Is how the ambience has transformed into." 'Donald house, Colaba, Mumbai..' 'Mrs. Joshi, my name is Man Singh.' 'I saw it with my own eyes.' 'Subramaniam didn't kill Kale, your husband did.' 'He gave a false statement and got that poor man sent to jail.' 'With that stolen money, you people suddenly became rich.' 'I've kept the truth hidden in my heart for 10 years.' 'Perhaps, it's not possible anymore.' 'I think I should go to police.' 'What? Death penalty? Vinod?' 'What's he saying?' 'Mrs. Joshi, my name is Man Singh.' 'I saw it with my own eyes.' 'Subramaniam didn't kill Kale, your husband did.' 'With that stolen money, you people suddenly became rich.' - Let loose. - Slow.. slow, sir. Watch out. 'Why wasn't I shattered on reading that letter?' 'Neither any blow, nor any shock?' 'Somebody has played a very cheap prank. Disgusting.' 'Man Singh. Who's this Man Singh?' 'Why does Vinod always gets disturbed about past matters?' 'There's definitely something wrong.' 'No, no. Vinod a thief, a murderer? It's impossible.' 'But if it is true then Mitthu...? What will he go through?' 'I don't understand what to do.' 'Should I tell this to Vinod, or..' - Madam, how long until dinner? - We'll eat early tonight. Set the table. - Lower it.. lower it. - First you let it loose. - Mitthu, come on, leave the kite. Look, you have to bathe, too. - Today, we'll eat early and sleep early, okay? - Yes, Mother. - Comics again? Are you going to read or sleep? - Both. Okay, but don't stay up for long, okay? Son, drink your milk. Mitthu, don't be obstinate. - Then how will you become like Father? - Okay. Mother, Jango was really fun today. He fired pistol and there was blood everywhere. 'What happened, you got hurt?' - 'No, no.' 'But this blood? What happened?' - 'A murder in our office. - Murder?' 'No.' Hello, Darling? I came early, didn't I? Hey? Meena? So much affection? - Hi, Father. - Mr. Joshi, how are you? Fine. - What time shall we fix for fishing? - Tomorrow. Tomorrow? I have a lot of work tomorrow. Hey, Meena. Darling, I love you so much. 'This is my Vinod.' 'What does a murderer look like? That's all the love you've got for me? What? 'Shall I tell him everything?' 'No, I should forget that prank.' 'Vinod is so nice, so innocent.' Meena, you look so nice today. I wonder how I won you over. Honestly speaking, Meena.. I can do anything for you. Hey, don't apply the cream today. Let's surprise Mitthu tomorrow. Let's go to the beach. I'll go to office after lunch. Okay, Mitthu, tell me, how would six elephants sit in a car? - It's an old one, Father. - Do you know it? This is such an old one. Third standard. Then tell me, if you know how they could. Okay, three in front and three behind. - Mother must have told you. - Don't dunk me, Father. What happened? Is the water going into your mouth? "When the heart's broken.." 'What happened? What is he doing? ' "She" doing.' ' "He" doing. We'll have a son, understand?' 'Meena, our son won't live in these conditions.' 'He'll get everything I didn't.' One, two, three. - Wait, I'll show you, Father. - What you'll show me? - I'll turn.. - Hey.. No, dad. - Mitthu, come on, now.. - 'Could Vinod kill for our happiness?' - She won't come. - She will, come on. Hey, cheater.. cheater, you started earlier. You started earlier. Cheater.. cheater.. cheater. Mother, come on, you also join us - Come on, please. - No, Mitthu, not today. Come on, please. The water's very cold. It'll be a lot of fun. - Father, tell her. - Come on. Come on. - No, I didn't bring spare clothes. - So what? No crowd today. - No. - No? Mitthu. - 1.. - No. - 2.. - No. - 3. - No. - No. No.. no, not like this. - Pull her in. Pull her in. - Come on. - No, listen. No, Vinod. No. - Come on. - What are you doing? No. What's the matter, Meena? Come on, relax. - Look at me, dad! - Enjoy yourself. Are you all right? 'I shouldn't think about it anymore.' Meena, pass me a chapatti (Indian bread). Meena, where are you lost? Pass me a chapatti please. 'Vinod is everything for me. Everything.' 'He's given me so much of happiness.' - Father. - Yes? Remember, we've to go for 'Guns of Navarone'? - Yes, I remember. We'll go next week. - Tell uncle Desai.. I want to go hunting. You're too young to go hunting. Right, Mother? - Yes. No hunting and all. - Did you hear? Oh, Mother, I'm old enough. - Bahadur, bring the rice. - Yes. 'I must behave normal.' 'I should get a grip on myself.' - What happened, Meena? Why haven't you eaten anything? - No, I have. Father, lentils please. Yes, bring the bowl. Meena, where's your nail cutter? Must be on the dressing table. Found it? When did you get this letter? When you were in Pune. You didn't tell me. Vinod, I.. I wanted.. Vinod, I really.. So, this letter is why you have been disturbed since so many days. And I thought that you were unwell. Meena.. Do you believe this letter? Meena? Do you think this letter is true? Meena, you.. Tell me, Meena, tell me. - Oh, darling.. - I would've told you, Vinod. - I didn't believe this. - Meena, you.. But, my mind.. Meena, you hid the matter from me that's why your mind.. Okay, now that you're in the open, your mind will ease up a little. Okay, please, darling, stop crying. Please. This is for ice-cream and anything else, okay? Mother, please give more. Sunil is also coming along. - Rs.5 more. Enough? - Thank you. - Hi, everybody. - Father. - Yes? - You came early today? Yes, Son, I didn't have much work today. I have to go to Delhi the day after tomorrow. I thought I'd spend some time with my family today. Mitthu. Hey, come on, let's go to Alibaug. We'll be back by tomorrow afternoon. No, Dad. Today is last day of 'Johnny's Revenge'. And Sunil's waiting, too. Bye. - Mitthu. - Bye. - Cross the road carefully. - Yes, Mother. 'Johnny's Revenge'. You should've called if you wanted to go to Alibaug. You're right. I should've called up. Oh, Madam, it's all right if Alibaug plan's scrapped.. But at least come to me. You're here, I'm here. We both are here. Meena, it's been so long, since your fingers fondled with my hair. Come on, get started. Lovely. - Vinod, is it true? - What? What? Meena, I won't answer this question, you will. Do you believe I can do this? What're you thinking? Meena, you know me best. Could I kill anybody? For money? Could I send an innocent man to jail? Tell me. Answer me, Meena. - This means, you believe the letter. - No, Vinod. - Then why did you ask me? - Vinod, my hand.. What? You believed that I'm a killer? No, Vinod, I didn't say that. It is that letter. Make me understand, Vinod, I want to understand. - What do you want to understand? - Everything. Who is Man Singh? Man Singh was a junior clerk in our firm. I didn't know him well. He says that he was present there on the night of the murder. I didn't see him. After the case, he tried to blackmail me. He said that I was the murderer. Why didn't you inform the police about this? Meena, you know how disturbed I was during the case. And if I hadn't done anything, then why should I be afraid? If this were true, then why didn't he go to police? It seems he's here to harass me again. Why is he targeting only you? Because, Meena, that night only Subramaniam.. Kale and I were working overtime. Even the guard was not around. This wicked man just wants to threaten me and extort money. - How? - By taking undue advantage of the opportunity. Had it been someone weak, he'd have been afraid. But I won't. After the case, he suddenly disappeared. And now, after so many years, he came to my office last week. I refused to meet him. And now this letter.. Which you believe in. No, Vinod, no. Not anymore. - Mitthu, read the weekly later, first drink your milk. - Yes, Mother. This inspection guy is really in a jam. Is it necessary to go to the office today? Yes. It's better to get as much work done, before leaving. Otherwise, I'll suffer after coming from Delhi. - Dad. - Yes? - Your office has been mentioned in the weekly. - Show.. show. - In weekly? Show me. - Ladies first. - I.. I'll read. I'll read. - 'Cases that have baffled the police'. - Not this, Father. - It's below that. - Mitthu, let me read first. - Look at the photo. 'We don't like losing, said the commissioner of Bombay police..' 'Mr. Subramaniam an employee of Ajay Shipping..' He got arrested for theft and murder? My goodness, Father. Even the stolen money wasn't found. Goodness, Rs.100,000. And all this in your office? Please tell me, Father. Were you there? Mitthu, come on. Drink your milk. He really committed murder? - It's all rubbish. - Then why is he in jail? And is he still in jail? Mitthu, drink your milk. Just imagine, it's been so many years and the police's still baffled. - Father, you must tell me the whole story. - Mitthu, drink your milk. Keep my bag ready for my Delhi trip. - Bye, Mitthu. - Bye. It's all rubbish. Darn it. It had to arrive today. Whenever this matter is mentioned.. You get very perturbed. Why is it so, Vinod? A part of my life is connected to it. It's over now. I don't even want its shadow to fall on my life today. It's like a nightmare for me. Meena.. Meena, forget that letter. Why can't we live a happy life? Forget it, Meena, please forget it for my sake. You've set the alarm? Come on, go to sleep, Meena. Did you need the pill? The meeting tomorrow is very important. "Monsoon will swing on every branch." "Monsoon will swing on every branch." "Rain will kiss thirsty lips." "Rain will kiss thirsty lips." "Today monsoon will dance in the eyes." 'Sleeping pills again? This will become a daily habit.' 'Yes, Meena, it's needed, otherwise I can't sleep.' 'The case is about to start and I'm very nervous.' 'Vinod would get annoyed on every matter back those days.' 'Sleeping pills..' 'I don't understand anything.' "Clouds have started showering, tonight." "Tonight, let the clouds shower." "Let the clouds.. the clouds.. The cloud shower." 'Got the money?' - 'No. - Then?' 'I'll have to arrange through other means.' - 'Please sell my jewellery. - Don't be silly. Not at all.' 'I know we desperately need money, and I'll get it somehow.' 'Those days we were always in need of money.' 'I wish, I knew more about it.' 'Vinod always kept the matter to himself.' "Far away from my house, like a showering cloud.." "There must be some relation somewhere for sure." 'How did we end up with so much of money?' 'Immediately after the case?' 'Police didn't find the money.' 'Then?' 'Vinod, who's this Man Singh after all?' 'Why was he quiet for all these days?' 'Why didn't he go to police?' 'Did.. did you give him the money?' Father, what was the delay? The plane arrived late from Hyderabad, Son. - Isn't that a Jumbo? - Yes. - It has a Rolls Royce engine, right? - Yes, perhaps. - Which one is your plane? - That one, Boeing. - Father, look your luggage. - Mitthu, you'll fall down. Listen, go and get a comic for yourself. Oh, good. One more Astrix. Thanks, Father. 'I.C. 105 is now ready to take off for Bangalore.' 'Passengers are requested..' '..to please proceed towards their aircraft. Thank you.' Meena, you're still disturbed. I don't understand, Meena. You're my wife. We love each other. And a letter has made you question your faith in me? No, Vinod, I want to believe you. After spending 10-12 years together.. You are saying you want to believe me? Meena, after such a long time, you don't force yourself to believe.. It should be your secondary nature. Is our love so weak? Can't you throw a letter out of our life? Vinod, where did you get that money from? What money? The one with which we bought the house in Alibaug.. Bought a car. We became rich after the case due to that money. - So, the matter has reached this far? - Vinod, I just.. Meena, I'm no longer a suspect. - You have made me an offender. - Vinod? You'll question me on every step. You'll argue on every matter. Meena, your eyes.. - I'm sorry. - You should be. Anyway, it's a good question. If it's important for you to know then listen. I earned that money in the share market.. Right after the case. But this is just a coincidence. Meena, if you demand account of each and every rupee.. Then I can't present it and I wouldn't as well. Meena, the doubt that has crept in your belief.. That could pose problems between us. I know, that you think a lot about truth and lies. And sometimes, too much thinking.. Forces you to believe in lies as well. But, Meena, happiness never come when you request for it. One has to work on it. And if we lose it even once.. Then neither of us will be able to recover it. Mitthu is a child now. If something happens.. Then he'll never forgive us. Why are you silent? Speak, Meena. Crying won't help anything. All this should finish when I return from Delhi. Do whatever you want to, Meena, but I can't live with you like this. - Vinod.. - Father.. Father, quick, your flight's been announced. - Yes, I heard it. Bought comics? - Yes. - Mother, come on, come quick. - Okay, Mitthu, bye. Father, you're going for two days and Mother's crying. - 1963-64, is it correct? - Yes. 'Vinod, forgive me. It's important for me to know.' 'When we do overtime..' '..the guard brings tea from downstairs at 8:30pm.' 'I was restless for tea.' 'And I looked at my watch. It was 8:25pm.' 'And right then, I heard a painful scream.' 'My cabin was on one side of the corridor.' About 30 feet away from Kale's cabin.' 'I came out of the cabin..' '..and I saw Kale falling down in the corridor in front of his cabin.' 'He was pointing towards the staircase.' 'He was drenched in blood.' I took him in my arms. 'He was murmuring, "Subbu..Subbu".' 'I kept him of the floor and rushed towards the staircase.' 'Yes, that's my paper knife.' 'My fingerprints would be on it.' 'I used it everyday in office for opening letters and stuff.' 'This knife would always be on my table.' 'And my table was in front of Kale's cabin.' 'The staircase was on one side of the bathroom..' '..on one side of the corridor.' 'I left office at 8:15pm.' 'I had told Kale that I might leave early for home.' 'Nobody saw me going home.' 'We all knew that there was money in Kale's cabin that night.' 'And.. and Kale's habit of going to bathroom..' '..was famous across the office.' 'He used to take at least 15-20 minutes in the bathroom.' 'But anybody in the office could've done this.' 'I didn't kill anyone. I don't have the money.' 'How could I kill Kale? He was my good friend.' 'He'd asked me to open the safe so many times. But..' 'When I reached the staircase, there was nobody there.' 'I peeped out of a window on the second floor.' 'There was nobody outside.' 'Suddenly. Subramaniam came out of the building.' 'He was running and looking here and there in nervousness.' 'He was carrying a paper parcel in his hand.' 'All this is lie.' 'Joshi was alone with Kale. He, too, could've done all this.' 'He must've done all this.' 'Why would I do all this?' 'That man was Subramaniam. I recognised him.' 'Who else could it be?' 'Average height, well built body, partially bald.' 'He was someone else.' 'I didn't commit the murder. I don't have the money.' 'The man Joshi saw was someone else.' 'I told you that it was bright downstairs.' 'I believe, that man was Subramaniam.' 'Kale, too, mentioned him.' 'That man has to be Subramaniam.' 'Who else could it be?' 'And hence, I sentence you to rigorous imprisonment.' 'No.. no. No, this is all a lie. This is all a lie.' 'Somebody save me.' 'No.. no. You can't do this.' 'I didn't do anything. I didn't kill anybody.' 'No.. no.. no. Save me.' 'For God's sake, save me.' 'What will happen to my wife and children?' 'This is sheer damnation.' 'If Subramaniam had really left..' '..then there was some other man who fled with the money.' 'The man who Vinod saw was Subramaniam.' 'But did Vinod really see Subramaniam?' 'This is what Vinod says.' 'The matter's only between Vinod and Subramaniam.' - Mother. - 'No.. no, this..' Mother. Shall I invite Sunil for lunch tomorrow or for dinner? - Mitthu, won't you drink milk? - I've finished it, Mother. Invite him for lunch. 'Where was Man Singh then?' 'Where did the money go?' 'It's not with Subramaniam.' Mother, these days you don't talk to me. - And Father, too, is not here. - Oh, Mitthu. Tell me, Lalita, who said that. - Tell me. - Jairam did. Jairam? I didn't say anything, she's lying.. You lied again. I'll break your jaws. - Never lie in front of me, understand? - Mother. Yes? - Who are you? - I.. - I am Mrs. Joshi. - Mrs. Joshi? Mrs. Vinod Joshi. Oh, so you are Mrs. Joshi. Jairam, go downstairs with Lalita. - No, I won't go. - I say go. - Okay, fine. - And don't come back until I call you. Come on, move. Move.. move. And listen, Jairam, don't go to that hotel. Go. Yes. My husband. Those were happy times. Our life was like a dream. But for how long? His sisters had to be married. He had to borrow money. Happiness left. Our Jairam also fell ill. Then the doctor's fees, medicines. Money. All became a reason, for drinking. But you.. What the hell are you here for? - What? - I.. - I.. - I know, it's reflecting on your face. - Your guilt has dragged you here. - No.. no. So, are you here to laugh at our plight? See. See.. see.. see with your own eyes. My children don't go to school. They wander around. They lie. Look.. look at this house. Look at me, look at my condition. Neighbours consider us filth. But still, we are alive. Ask how. What do we eat? That same Rs.100,000. Isn't it apparent when you look around? Don't you see that Rs.100,000? My poor husband, he never lied in his life. That Kale, his one and only friend. His fingerprints were on everything that Kale had. But that so called friend.. Ruined my husband while dying. And Mr. Joshi's 20 minutes testimony.. Only 20 minutes? That was an unfortunate day for my husband. He drank endlessly. Came home late and that's it. We didn't even have anyone to fall back on. Because we were simple people. And Mr. Joshi? He saw him from the second floor. And that, too, in the darkness, right? And now you've come to see us in bright glowing light? Open up.. open up the door. The air we live in, you couldn't even breathe in here. Come on, open it. This door always remains open. The whole world knows our condition. Open it. And, Mrs. Joshi, go from here. Got to your husband, to your child. I'll raise my children. They need their father, who you people snatched away. But still I'll raise them. Ask me how. How? Where will I bring money for their upbringing? How will I bring the money? Want to know anything else? Want to hear anything else? Leave after your hearts satisfied. Ask.. ask more, otherwise get lost from here. Get out. Escape from this truth to your dream world. And all of you just stand and watch the fun. Yes. Does anyone know any better here? 'Mrs. Subramaniam.' 'What would I've done in her position?' 'Laxmi Building.' 'Matunga.' Driver, ask somebody the way to Donald House. - Where's Donald House? - Go ahead and take left turn. It's in front of Electric House. Enquire about Mr. Man Singh's residence. He lives on the first floor. - What is it? - Is Mr. Man Singh home? Mother, someone's here. Yes? What is it? Does Mr. Man Singh live here? Yes, Madam. I want to meet him Come in. Sit. Sit please. - I'm fine. - Sit here. I'll call him. Man, somebody's here to see you. Come. Come in. Please come. You? - I am Mrs. Joshi. - Oh yes.. yes. Come.. come. Forgive me, but I can't even stand. Sit.. sit. Rosy, give her a seat. You can sit here. So many years have passed, I didn't recognise you. Rosy, go inside, send tea and snacks. And don't come until I call you. Oh, Man, I won't get in your way. - Rosy, I have to talk to her in private. - Okay. - Go and send tea. - No.. no, I don't want tea. I don't want anything. Okay, all right. Take away the radio. You've changed a lot, Mrs. Joshi. I remember, I saw you during the case. Even Vinod's not the same old Vinod anymore. Mr. Man Singh.. I am unable to understand your letter. I was right. You don't know anything about this. - About what? - About the murder. But I studied the whole case. Studied? But I've heard and even seen the whole case. Mrs. Joshi, I even remember Vinod's face. In the witness box, nervous.. Scared. I, too, was in the same condition. I, too, had to suffer a lot. But Vinod saw Subramaniam. Really? In the darkness of night? From the second floor? Yes, Vinod saw Subramaniam and became wealthy. I agree he fed me for a few days. But when I fell sick, he considered me dead. Mrs. Joshi, I've been dying everyday for the past 8 years. And Vinod, he didn't even care for me. A few days ago I went to meet him.. With so much difficulty, Mrs. Joshi. And he blatantly refused even to meet me. Now.. now I cannot endure anymore. But that murder.. I can never forget. Mrs. Joshi, that murder will never let me be at peace. Vinod was prepared for this in advance. Mrs. Joshi, I cannot forget that stream of blood.. Painful scream. I have nightmares every night. I, too, want to sleep peacefully. I, too, need sleep. What could be worse than this? I'll have to go to jail. - But now, I should go to police. - No.. no, don't do this. - Please. - You're stopping me from doing this, Mrs. Joshi. But that murder has been benefiting you since last 10 years. Have you ever thought about Mrs. Subramaniam? But Subramaniam's the murderer. You sound so confident, Mrs. Joshi. I saw that murder with my own eyes. Vinod and I, we both needed money desperately. We planned to steal from accountant Kale's safe. One day, we got the opportunity. Subramaniam, Kale and Vinod were doing overtime. The guard went out to bring tea. Fortunately, Subramaniam left office. As Kale went to bathroom, Vinod gave me the key.. And asked me to go to Kale's cabin. He picked up Subramaniam's paper knife and guarded the door. I was shivering with fear. I asked Vinod not to.. Not to do anything stupid. We were not finished, and Kale came out of the bathroom. And before he could come to know anything.. Vinod shoved the knife into his throat. No, this is not possible. Vinod's not like that. Yes, he is. You don't know how cunning your husband is. He has a strong presence of mind. He asked me to flee with the money. I came here somehow and hid myself. I was very scared. I didn't even touch the money. After a few days, Vinod came and took away the money. He gave some to me as well. I left my job and started living at home. I used to meet Vinod sometimes. But ever since I fell sick.. He refused to help me. I.. I didn't have so much courage.. That I could say anything against Vinod. He's very sharp. He can do anything. And I also feared, that I would be jailed. Now.. Now I'm shattered. Now, I don't care about anyone, Mrs. Joshi. I don't care about anyone. I want to sleep in peace. I haven't slept in 10 years, Mrs. Joshi. Murder.. scream.. Every night. Please don't go to the police. I beg of you. Give us some more time. Please. I don't understand what to do. All right. I won't go. But it hurts so much. I cannot walk. Please, Mrs. Joshi, help me a little. Give some money for going to the doctor. It'll be very kind of you. Please. - Driver, Mr. Banerjee's place. - Okay. "Don't drop down the curtain now, wait." "There are many more stories ahead." Hello, Meena my child, come, come. I recorded it yesterday. Listen to my new song. "Just now the raw soil has turned fertile.." "And just now, water has soaked it." Wow.. wow, what a song. "Now, I'm feeling sleepy, wait.. wait.. wait." Wow.. wow.. wow. "Don't drop down the curtain now, wait." "There are many more stories ahead." "Don't drop down the curtain now, wait." "Now, the sorrows of heart keep fuming." What a note, the way the emotion of fuming has been mentioned. "Now, the sorrows of soul keep fuming." "Now, the grief of an aching heart surfaces." Oh, the way I've expressed the feeling of surfacing. Wow.. wow, what melody. "Now, the sorrows of soul keep fuming." "Now, the grief of an aching heart surfaces." "Now, the feelings are alive. Now, the feelings are alive." - "Wait.. wait.. wait." - Wow.. wow, what a song. - "Don't drop down the curtain now, wait." - Perhaps, child.. Perhaps, I should've been a singer. How is it? All right? - "Lot more.." - You've turned me deaf.. By making me hear it constantly. At least spare poor Meena. - When did you come, my dear? - Just now. And you forgot to go out. Look, how your aunt dominates. You've come after so many days, my dear. - Tell me, what will you drink? - No, nothing. - You'll have to take something. - No, really. - Is it? Okay, how is Mitthu? - All right. And when is Vinod returning from Delhi? - Within a couple of days. - Yes, he has a very sharp mind. What am I? He used to guide me. I got three clients like that, like Vinod. He became rich. And made us rich as well. - Uncle, you've known him for 10-12 years, right? - 10 years? Vinod came to us.. In 19.. in 1963, right? 'Oh, my God. In 1963?' - Yes, in 1963. After a couple of days of Lopu's wedding. He had so much faith in me. I still remember. It was the month of March in 1963. It was summer. Vinod came to our office. He was drenched in sweat. He said, "Mr. Banerjee, take this Rs.50,000." "Rs.50,000 cash. Make me rich." After all, I am a stockbroker. Take money from him, invest here, and make it grow. Then withdraw it, invest elsewhere, and watch it grow. I made him rich. I made him rich. Where did Vinod get that money from? Which money? Rs.50,000? I don't know about it. He never told me. I never asked him. He came and kept Rs.50,000 cash on my table. Cash. What is the matter, dear? - Nothing. - My dear, would you like to listen to another song? - Forget it. - Three minutes for the song, two minutes for the Uncle. Dear, you haven't had anything. I'll come right away. No, not today. I'm in a hurry. Bye. Bye. God bless you, dear. We should've gone to receive Father, right? How can we, Mitthu? His secretary had called. He told us that few people are coming from Delhi. - So, he'll go to office straightaway. - So what? He doesn't like it. - Mitthu, phone. - Mother, you please. 374832. He's been waiting for you. Everything's fine. This afternoon? He'll jump with joy. Vinod, please. Afterwards. Bye. - Father called, right? - Yes. What did he say? He's asked you to get ready. - You're going fishing in the afternoon. - Oh, boy. - Father. Father. Over there. - Quiet, Mitthu. There, you scared it away. Mitthu, the first rule of fishing is to stay quiet. Second is to wait until the fish is caught. And pull it when it wants to run away. Do you understand? - Yes, Father, sorry. - It's okay. Now, keep quiet. - Father. I got one. I got one. - Oh, lovely. Give me, Mitthu. Give it to me, Mitthu. Come on, give me. It should not be made to suffer too much. You should kill it by hitting it on a stone. Father, give it to me, please. Mitthu, not with so much force. Gently. You should know how much and where to hit. Mother, look, my first fish. Meena, what next? I don't understand anything. Me neither. Meena, we.. Meena, we've been together for long. We've loved each other. But our life changed in a single day. I thought it was a dream. But I was wrong. Uncle had called. You had gone to his home. You asked him where I had got that much of money from. I couldn't help it. I needed to know. Vinod, where did you get so much money from after the case? Meena, there's a limit to everything. Until now, the matter was between us.. But now you've dragged others in it. You think that I'm a murderer. That's it. Everything's over. Now, there's nothing between us. That Man Singh. I'll deal with him. No, Vinod. You won't go to him. Promise me. For my sake. Why? Would I murder him, too? What are you doing? Now, I have no reason to sleep here. I'll go and sleep with Mitthu. It'll make me feel better.. - And you'll be spared from sleeping with a murderer. - Vinod. Yes, Meena. When I look at your face, you turn it away. When I look into your eyes, you look the other way. If I touch you, you feel very distant. Instead of such intimacy, it's better if we keep away. Goodnight. - Hi, Mitthu, you're still reading? - Father, please let me read. - Today, I'll sleep with you. - Really? Yes, only two days are left before the school starts. And I've not spent much time with you during the holiday. - Good idea? - Great, Dad. Oh, lovely. But would Mother sleep alone? She sleeps many times, doesn't she? - Oh, I must tell Mother. - No, Mitthu. Mitthu, come back here. Mother, Father is sleeping with me. Don't forget. Today, we have to take Mr. and Mrs. Choudhury for dinner. - Is the driver needed? - No. He's been provided with a car from the office. We'll travel by it. Father, please don't go. I'm going back tomorrow. I'm helpless, dear. But I promise, we'll come back early. - Okay? - Okay. - Bahadur. - He went downstairs with the coat and bag. - Bye, Mitthu. - Bye. Mother, you've not prepared my chocolate cake. I haven't forgotten, Mitthu. I'll prepare it today. Madam, someone's here to meet you. - Who is he? - Mr. Man Singh. - Seat him downstairs. - He has come upstairs. He is talking with Mitthu in the balcony. - You may go, I'll be there. - Yes, Madam. - In which school do you study? - I study in Dehradun. Really? You stay so far away? You are brave. Was it your Dad who hunted that tiger? No, Uncle Desai hunted it down. - Your father cannot hunt a tiger? - He certainly can. - Hello. - Tell me. You're a very kind person, Mrs. Joshi. I've come to meet you despite being so weak. How can you say that my father cannot hunt a tiger? No, dear. I made a mistake. He certainly can. Why just a tiger, he can kill anybody. - Mitthu, go inside. - Okay. He's a good boy. Mr. Man Singh, why are you here? What if my husband finds out? Don't worry, Mrs. Joshi. I've come after finding out that he's in office at this moment. I know, that he hates me a lot. I'm here to tell you that I didn't go to the police. After meeting you I thought.. That it would not be my regret.. But a big crime to take advantage of the unmentionable past. I saw your son, too. He's a lovely boy. Now, I'll never be able to go to the police. - Thank you. - Why do you need to thank me? You must be busy. I'll leave. There's just one thing. That day you visited me as an angel. You gave me money. I began my treatment. Now, I feel quite better. But the doctor said.. That the treatment should be continued for two more months. If you could help me little more, I'd be grateful. I'll see. Please sit inside. Anything else, please. - Sweet dish for you? - No, she won't have it. She is on diet. Why do you need to diet? - I've to be careful, you know with my.. - I'll have coffee. Okay. - What will you have? Ice-cream? - No, thanks. I must have coffee after dinner. - Please you, too, have coffee. - No, thanks. I won't have anything. - Bring three coffees. - Yes, sir. The dinner was very good, Mr. Joshi. The food here is always good. Joshi's choice is always good. - Thank you. - Ladies and gentlemen, attention please. - The show of the evening.. - Oh, lovely. - Cabaret will begin now. - For your pleasure. Presenting lovely, luscious, Rosita. "Where have I reached?" "Only animals are here." "Elephant, tiger and there's a monkey. too." "Oh, is that a full moon on the dark night?" "What shine, what dazzle." "Oh, what's this? Soda bottle?" "Now tell me, how do I look?" "Little or big?" "Away or near?" "No, no." "Oh, God. Is this moustache or a sword?" "No, I don't want it." "Hey, kid, how have you come alone without your Mother?" "Dear kid." "Lovely kid." "Would you like to grow up? Come on, close your eyes." "Yes, like that. Okay? Ready?" "Go." - Superb cabaret. - I'm glad you liked it. Joshi, I enjoyed it. This is nothing. She is a very old one. - Really? - The new girls do a lot more. - Really? Oh, my. Just imagine. I must see it. - Excuse me, Madam. - Mrs. Joshi. - What is it? - Rosita's calling you inside for a minute. - Why? - Rosita? - Rosy, the cabaret dancer? I do not know any Rosita. She has made a request. Please come for a minute. - Yes, please go. We'll have coffee till then. - Yes, go. I'll be back soon. Joshi, did you check the design that was shipped? Yes, the Yugoslavian is as per our plan.. I don't know how to tell you this. What you'd think about me. But it's very important. That day you gave money to Man Singh, right? Yes. - You paid him again today? - Yes. Mrs. Joshi.. I don't know why you are doing this. Don't give him money again. Please. But he's sick. Doctor's fee.. The money for medicine.. Mrs. Joshi.. Perhaps you think.. Whatever I'm doing is for myself. Man Singh has been with me for years, not just today. He left his job. I didn't complain. He fell sick. I didn't lose my courage. Perhaps.. I'll lose something due to your benevolence. - That day after meeting you.. - Excuse me. They must be waiting for me. Oh, yes. I know. But before you go, please listen to this.. Man Singh is my life. Don't worry about doctor's fee and medicines. I'll handle it. I'm not asking what relationship you have with him. I don't want to know either. I just want to live in peace. - Mitthu, you're still awake? - Father, I was waiting for you. What's all this? I told you many times not to read under this light. You'll ruin your eyes. Then you'll have to wear glasses like your father. Did you eat well? Yes, Mother. Father, they showed a test match on TV today. - Did you watch Greg? - Yes, he is taller than you. Really? What more did you see? After that, there was a horrible man. Like the horrible man who came today morning. - Who had come? - Man Singh. - Man Singh.. - What did he say? - He said you cannot kill a tiger. - Go to sleep now. Come on. - Father, piggy ride. Darling, look at the time. But I'm going back to school tomorrow. Father, please just once. I had forgotten. Come on. Meena. What's going on? Man Singh came here. What did he want? Who is Rosy? How do you know her? Why don't you say anything? And what's this? 'I don't want your alms. Mrs. Subramaniam.' And this Rs.500. It was mailed to my office to be handed over to you. What's going on, Meena? Explain it to me. I want an explanation. I had gone to her home. What? You had gone to her home? Where did you get the address from? From the newspaper archives. And Man Singh? I had gone to his home, too. No, Meena, no. What did he say? He told me everything. Vinod, what have you done? Why? Why? To purchase the Alibaug house. To send Mitthu to the boarding. For this house. For the car. For all the pleasures. That's all. Are you happy now? You're not my Meena. I had hopes till yesterday. But today you've gone very far from me. - I cannot tolerate this. - I cannot tolerate this either. You cannot tolerate it. I cannot tolerate it. Then why doesn't this matter end? What have you thought? Tell me.. What do you want to do? I don't know. You don't know? Strange. You knew about whatever you've done until now. - Please, Vinod, it hurts. - Oh, I'm sorry. It hurts you. What about me? But keep one thing in mind.. Mitthu should not find out about this. Until his stay till tomorrow, even if it's a pretence.. You must act like me Meena. Do you understand? Yes, Father. Father, bye. - Mitthu, write a letter as soon as you reach there. - Okay, Mother. - Bye, Mitthu. Cricket team. - Of course. Go carefully. You go now. Don't wait for me for dinner. What about you? Where are you going? Meena, I don't see the need to tell you about it. The things you did so far, did you ever ask for my permission? Did you inform me? - Now, give me the key. - Vinod, please. Meena, don't harass me anymore. From today our ways are different. Give me the key. Vinod, please don't do this. Let's go home. Come on, Meena, give me the key. Hurry up. Driver, go. Man is doing all this? I can't believe it. I don't understand.. Why he is doing all this. It's disgusting. Look, my family's everything for me. I can tolerate anything, but I cannot see my family ruined. Please don't say so, Mr. Joshi, I promise you. This won't be repeated ever again. I didn't know that he is up to such things. It's such a terrible thing to do. Man, what's this that I'm hearing? What? Oh, so you were telling her? What did I do? I haven't done anything. Don't you know what you've done? Man, how could you do such a thing? What have I done? I haven't done anything. What ploy are you both planning together? - You blackmailer. Don't you feel ashamed? - Oh, God. - If you ever do this again, it'll be the worst for you. - Mr. Joshi.. Please let him go. I assure you that he won't do this again. Tell him to come with me and tell the truth to my wife.. And end this sham. Otherwise, I'll kill you. Please, Man, go with him. Man, please. Mr. Vinod, what's the use threatening a poor fellow like me? Go and show your manliness to your wife. Go and look into her eyes. Will she consider you innocent if I tell her so? Go. What's the use of shouting at me, Mr. Vinod? - If you can't handle your wife, why are you showing off here? - Man. You, son of.. I'll deal with you.. Man.. Man.. Stop it. - I'll show you my manliness. - Leave me. - No one can save you today. - Move away, Man. Stop it, Man. What is happening? Move aside. I won't spare you today. I won't spare you today. - Please don't.. - Leave me. He'll do everything you ask him to. He will. Please don't kill me. - Will you come with me? - Yes. - Man.. - Drunkard. Murderer. What do you think? You can scare me? I was dead for 10 years. Now, I'm a different man. Why just you, nobody can do anything to me. - Get lost. - Man Singh. - Go home and tell your wife.. - How you committed the murder. - What's wrong with you? - Go and tell her. - What nonsense are you talking about? - Man. - Something's wrong with him. This man's crazy. - Let go of me. Move aside. - No. Stop it. Stop it. - Mr. Joshi. - If you care for your life, then throw away the knife. - Man. Throw it away. Please. - You can't do this. - Throw it away. - You get out of my home. - Why are you running inside? - Mr. Joshi, please don't.. You move aside, I'll not let him go alive. - Come inside. - Come out. - Would you dare come inside? Come on. - Move aside. Sorry, I lost my key. It's very late, isn't it? Mitthu must be waiting for me. I'll go and sleep next to him. Sorry, please go to sleep. Vinod. Vinod. Vinod. Please go away from here, Meena. - What has happened to you? - Don't touch a murderer. - Please listen to me. - Now, nothing is left to be heard. - Vinod, please. - Please. It's all over. Leave me alone. Go away. Switch off the lights. 'You don't find your destination by just walking.' 'To stop is a destination in itself.' 'Yes, I'll stop.' 'But Vinod won't be able to bear it ever.' 'He shouldn't even feel it that I've committed suicide.' 'But how?' 'I'll have to say goodbye to Vinod without raising suspicion.' No, Vinod, now don't be so distant from me. It was madness, it has ended. Please forgive me. Am I dreaming? This is the problem. You never dream.. And I'm always lost in one. Vinod, I'm nothing without you. Meena. I've been through so much. I was lost in darkness, Meena. Loneliness was hurting me. Everything seemed so empty. Perhaps, because you were not with me. Everything's over now. Forget the past. Let's go to Alibaug. - Are you saying this? - Yes. What about the office? Just for a couple of days. You and me. Just the two of us. Okay. Meena. "The heart is one, life is one, my darling." "My life is there where you are." "Yes, my life." "Where? Where?." "Leave your footprint on the this ground." "The sky will bow and kiss that ground." "Your footprint." "Where are those prints?" "The flaring sunlight is walking under the shadows." - "Flaring? - Yes, flaring." "The flaring sunlight is walking under the shadows.." "in search of your footprints." "Tell me, where the footprints are.." - Listen, I'm going to the garage for a while. - Now? Yes, I'll be back in 10 minutes. - All right. I'm going to the beach. - Okay, come soon. - Vinod, is the player on? - Yes, I know. Let it play. "The rain is kissing thirsty lips." "The rain is kissing thirsty lips." "Today, monsoon will dance in the eyes." "Today, monsoon will dance in the eyes." "There is smoke everywhere." This is the right time. I should end it right here and now. If I go back, I'll entangle myself again. Vinod will take care of Mitthu. It won't be difficult if I can find the courage. Meena! Meena? What have you done? Oh, thank God! You stupid fool! "The mind should fly on the wings of the eyes." "Letting go of the hand." "He is going away." Meena! Meena? "God knows.." Meena, you tried to commit suicide? Why Meena? Why? Why were you doing so? Meena? Meena, open your eyes. Look, I'm near you. Your Vinod! Look at me. Please! You were leaving me alone. - You were leaving me. - You.. - Are you crying, Vinod? - No. Please don't cry. Vinod, don't cry. I can't see you like this. Don't cry. You never thought about me. What would happen to me without you? What would happen to Mitthu? I cannot even think of Mitthu without you. Both of you are always happy together. Even if I were not here, it would not have made any difference. I thought this was the only way out. You fool! We are nothing without you. We need you. Do you understand? Look at this. These are the equity share records. The money that I had given to uncle.. This is an account of every penny of it. Meena, I tried hard to prove my innocence. But the old stock-brokering company was closed. The records could not be found. Suddenly I remembered that my old papers should be in.. Those boxes which I had sent here from Mumbai. And I found them. Vinod! Meena, do you remember those difficult times.. When we were living only on hope? I was putting all the money in the share market. Hoping that some day I'll make profits. The day arrived soon. Immediately after the case, I got Rs.50,000. I went to uncle with the cash. He did the rest. Look at this. These are the papers accounting for Rs.50,000. "In the blue sky." "In the blue sky." "The sea is seen." "In the blue sky." "The sea is seen." "The sky in the sea." "The sky in the sea." "To the unknown.." "The mind worries about the unknown." "The mind worries about the unknown." "It fears the known." "The mind's bird flies with the wings of the eyes." "Leaving the hand it's going away." "It calls out from far away." "With the wings of the eyes." Yes! - Mr. Vinod Joshi? - Yes. - Mrs. Joshi? - Yes. - You'll have to come to Mumbai with me. - Why? - Last night Rosy was murdered in Colaba. - Rosy? Meena, don't say anything. - Are we under arrest? - No, but it would be better if you come with me. - May we change clothes? - Yes. Come on, Meena. Please pass me my glasses from there. Hurry up. But what are you doing, Vinod? I know what I'm doing. It is necessary. Vinod, why are you running away? - I had gone there. - Oh, God! Last night I had forgotten my keys there. My fingerprints are all over the house as well as on the knife. It is necessary for my defence. Otherwise they will trap me. Don't worry. We are not arrested. But.. Meena, don't come with me. You stay here. Vinod, please let me come too. Please! No, Meena. I'll bring him right now. Can you find that person, Vinod? Why not? He stays opposite him. He is his neighbour. - Oh, you? - Listen, this is important. You must help me. You should stand witness. - About what happened last night.. - No, I know nothing. - I don't want police trouble. - Please! - The police had come today. I didn't meet them. - Listen to me! - I know nothing. - Please! - You can't do this. - No. Why don't you understand? - I won't come. - An innocent life will be destroyed. - A family will be ruined. - I won't come. No! - Why won't you come? - Go! You must come with me or I'll call the police. Why do you harass me? - You must try to understand.. - Please go. - Please forgive me. - If you don't give your statement to the police.. Go away! Go! No! Please! For humanity's sake. I assure you that you'll not be affected. You only have to tell what you've seen. You have to tell the truth. You have to tell police that when I left here last night.. Rosy was alive. She had closed the door. You're right. But I don't want police trouble. - Go away! - For the sake of my wife and my child. We'll be ruined. And you'll be a partner in this sin. Don't think too much. Please come with me. - All right. Let's go. - Thank you. Please hurry up. I'll always be indebted to you, Mr. Bhalekar. Hurry up. My car is parked outside. Tell the police whatever you've seen. I'm alone. To get into such matters.. And did anybody think that something like this would happen? - Come. - To tell the truth, when you left, I had heard a scream.. - Hey! - Man Singh, let him go. Man Singh! Your anger has still not subsided, Mr. Joshi? I say, let him go. No, don't move forward. Oh, he will kill me. Mr. Joshi, he'll kill me. Bhalekar, shut up. Don't make a noise. If you want him alive, move forward. - Come on. - What do you mean? Please move. Or I'll die. Move forward. Mr. Joshi, take this. Open the door. Please open, Mr. Joshi. Please save me. Key, Mr. Joshi. Get inside. Please go inside, Mr. Joshi. Don't do anything to him. If something happens to him.. I'll not let you go alive. - Please get inside quietly. - Hey! Open the door. I say, open the door. - Don't harm him. - I won't harm him. - If something happens.. - Don't scream, Mr. Joshi. - I won't scream. Man Singh, listen to me.. - Where are you taking me? - Man Singh, please don't do anything to him. - Please let me go. Man Singh! Damn it. Is anybody there? Is anybody there? - Vinod? - Open the door. - Vinod, what happened? - Please call somebody immediately. - Are you all right? - His life is in danger. I'm locked inside. Quickly! Somebody is in danger. - Run! - Yes, I'll come right away. There is nobody over there, Meena. Go downstairs. Hurry up. - Inspector! - Are you alone here? Where is Mr. Joshi? Please hurry up. Vinod is locked in Man Singh's room. Please hurry up. Locked in Man Singh's room? What kind of ploy is this? Come to the police station with me. You can't play with the law in this manner. - Rane! - Yes, sir. - Who went inside the building? - I was following Man Singh. They came here after Man Singh. Inspector, Vinod went in before Man Singh. Please listen to me. Come upstairs and look. - He knows nothing. - Rane, is she right? - No, sir. I was following Man Singh. - You have to come upstairs! Don't waste my time and come with me. I'm telling the truth. Please listen to me otherwise it will be too late. Inspector, please help Vinod. You have to do everything. You have to climb. You have to fall. No! Please don't kill me. I beg of you. Come on. Mr. Joshi! Mr. Joshi? Please don't kill me. - Let me go. - I'll count up to 10. One, two, three.. - Four.. - Don't kill me. Just a while back there was sound from inside. Please do something. Break the door. Please, Inspector. Move aside, Rane! - Let me go.. - Eight, nine.. Bhalekar, run. Where will you run? Joshi, save me! Please save me. Save me. Stop! What's wrong with you? Have you gone mad? Why are you after him? - To prepare a proof against you. - What proof against me? What was the evidence against Subramaniam? Both of you were drunk. His fingerprints were only on the knife. Your fingerprints are all over house. Your key is there too. Bhalekar saw you running away after killing Rosy. Just as you had seen Subramaniam. - What nonsense are you talking? - I'm not crazy. I'll stand witness against you that you killed Bhalekar. I tried my best to save him, but I couldn't do anything. As if the police will accept whatever you say. Why not? - Let go of him. - I won't. - You won't? - No. You won't? - Bhalekar, run! Run! - I'll die. - Stop him! - Run! Is anybody inside? Please open the door. The door won't open, Mr. Joshi. Nobody is coming. It is closed so who'll come? Now what can I do? Where can I go? What do I do, Mr. Joshi? Is anybody there? Please open the door. Anybody there? What can I do now? Inspector, they must be somewhere else. How many doors I'll have to break? Enough of your trick. Come with me. Something is certainly wrong. Vinod had said that somebody's life is in danger. Those people.. Inspector, I have never lied in my life. Please save Vinod. I.. Rane, search the whole building. Come on. What a path! I'll show him now. Doesn't matter. You dare do this? I'll teach you a lesson. Stop, don't run away. Come here. No! Stop him! Bhalekar, have you gone mad? I'll not let him get away. I'll kill him. - Come to your senses. - Let go of me. If he dies, then what's the difference between you and him? I won't let him get away. I'll kill him! Bhalekar, come to your senses. Today he can't run away from us. Mr. Joshi, he has run away. He ran away. What have you done? Man Singh, I won't let you get away. - Man Singh! - Man Singh! Somebody is coming. Police! - What is happening here? - Thank God. - Vinod! - Police is here. Meena, I'm okay. He is here. Inspector, Man Singh was trying to kill both of us. Please come, Inspector. He must be nearby here. - Come on. - Man Singh, where are you? - Man Singh! - Police have arrived to take you to the gallows. It is impossible. Nobody can hang me. - I'll kill myself before that. - No, Man Singh. No! Mr. Joshi, don't come here. If you move a step forward, I'll jump off. No, Man Singh. Please don't do this. Man Singh, believe me. Come down. Nothing will happen to you. Look, didn't I save you from Bhalekar? Believe me. Come down. Please believe me, nothing will happen to you. Don't try to trap me. Nobody is trying to trap you. Please come down. Man Singh, come down. Please, come down. Don't be a coward. Tell the police who killed Rosy. And why you were trying to kill us? Bhalekar, forget all about it. Was Man Singh trying to kill us deliberately? He is sick. He needs treatment. So you are trying to send me to mental institution? No, Man Singh, to the police station. Come on. Get down. Very good, Inspector. You caught him. I was going to kill him. Otherwise he'd have killed me. And he'd have killed him too. You are unnecessarily chasing Mr. Joshi. When he left last night, Rosy was alive. I've seen it. She had closed the door. After that I heard a scream. But why should I get into trouble? Man Singh, what do you want to say? I don't want to say anything. Why not? Man Singh, tell the truth. You were blackmailing us. Rosy tried to stop you, so you killed her. Isn't it? Rosy loved you so much. She lived for you. Have you really killed her? Crook, you're such a lowly person. I've seen since years. Rosy did so much for you. But you? Even the dogs are more loyal than you. No, I didn't kill her. You don't understand. Truly, Mr. Joshi. I didn't kill him deliberately. It just happened. Do you remember, Mr. Joshi? I went to inside room to save myself from you. And I had switched off the lights. Think about Mrs. Joshi. Please do me a favour. Please go to your home. Please go home. All right. But you must talk to him. If you dare, come inside. Drunkard, Murderer. You are in my control. You can't do anything against me. Come inside! Who do you think you are? Don't you fear me? Come in! I'll show you the colour of blood. Man Singh! What has happened to you? - I'll call the doctor. - No, I don't need a doctor. Give up everything. Return their happiness to them, Man. Even if God forgives you.. Rosy will never forgive you for that. Rosy. Rosy? For a long time we stayed that way. Her life came to an end slowly. I too didn't want to live. But when it was morning, again I wanted to live. So I wrote a complaint against Mr. Joshi to the police. But now I'm very tired. I need sleep very badly. Mr. Joshi, I've really not slept for 10 years. Yes, Mrs. Joshi, this is the only truth that I've told you. I had gone to that office 10 years ago only to steal money. The work was over so I came out. "The man's heart is so unyielding." Subbu! Subbu? Subbu! I just stabbed him and I ran away. I was unfortunate that Mr. Kale died. Oh, God! You murdered Mr. Kale too. Yes, I did. Subramaniam had already gone home. Mr. Kale thought I was Subramaniam. You too thought the same. And what did you do with the stolen money? I was very afraid, and thought somebody was following me. I was hiding near a pool. And then.. I'm really unfortunate. I can't swim. When I came back home, I found out that Mr. Kale died. After that I stayed at home as I was afraid. And I fell sick. But that letter.. After so many years.. Just like that. A few days ago I had gone to meet Mr. Joshi. He refused to see me. So I wrote something in anger. I hadn't even thought that it would affect you so much. But you believed that letter and invited sorrow. Vinod! What a tale. You are really unfortunate. Come on. Rane! Sorry, Mr. and Mrs. Joshi, you had to face trouble. Mr. Bhalekar, had you informed the police about this yesterday.. This drama would not have occurred today. Come on, Rane. Inspector, please forgive me. I made a mistake. But today I've learnt a lot. Mr. Joshi, forgive me. You had to face trouble because of me. I'll go now. Bye. Vinod, are you all right? Let's go to the doctor. Meena, I'm a murderer too. Man Singh murdered Mr. Kale. I did the same to Mr. Subramaniam. I gave him ten years of living death. I knew that there was some mistake. So I used to get disturbed by the past. But Vinod, you didn't do that deliberately. No, Meena. In those days I was sure that I had seen Subramaniam. And I stood witness thinking I was true. But after the case, the matter began to disturb me. And my frustration increased. But there were other evidences against him. Yes, Meena. He too is unfortunate. But what can I do about it? Please don't get disturbed. I'm with you. Your whole life is ahead of you. We'll do our best to ensure that his family is well off in life. Can we do this, Meena? Yes, Vinod. Meena!
