You Tube - Video Running Time 02:08:29 You Tube search name - Solva Saal Hey, Leela. Give it to me. No, I won't. It's my bottle. Don't you dare touch my things. Who are you to stop me? I will touch them. Touch it and I'll break your teeth! Geeta! Wait till I come out. I won't spare either of you. You'll break my teeth? Take a look at your long face. I've seen it. But I won't give you the bottle, it's mine. - Why did you take my ribbons yesterday? - And why did you wear my earrings? Why did you ask to wear my bangles for the party the other day? I only asked for your bangles. Didn't you take something in return? Don't you have to go to school? Get ready quickly. - She's fighting with me. - She took my bottle of hair... Hey. Pappu. - What do I apply on my head now? - My shoe. - Geeta, I'll show you... - Sis, she's hitting me! - Hey, Geeta! Leela! You're testing my patience. I'll teach you both a lesson you won't forget. Get going! - Laaj. - Coming, father. Where are you, my dear? Please come downstairs. Everything's kept there. Pappu, what's this? Where are your knickers? Sister will bring them. - Sister will bring them, indeed! - Where's my cap? Cap, my foot! You haven't worn your knickers. Aren't you ashamed? - My tie... I can't find my tie... - What's this, then? I can't do a thing without you, can't even find my clothes. I wonder what will happen to this house once you get married. Who'll look after these children? Get ready soon, father. I'll keep breakfast ready. Okay, my dear. I'll be there soon. - Ramu, Ramu... - Here comes the storm. - Ramu, give me my milk. - No, give me first. - No. Me, first. - Not toast, silly, milk. - Hurry up. - I will, just wait. I'm human, not a machine. - "I'm human, not..." - Hey, Leela, you won't learn, will you? - I won't drink milk today. - Leela... - I won't drink milk today. Pappu, you want to be an engine driver? Then drink your milk. Sister, daddy is trying to fool me again. Laaj, you've still not had breakfast? We'll miss the fast train. Greetings, uncle. - Greetings, my dear. - Ramu, just attend to the children. - Father, I've to leave. We're very late. - Your breakfast, my dear... Bye-bye, sister. SIXTEENTH YEAR Wow! That's fantastic. Wow. Superb. Hello. I said 'hello'. - Hello. - Tell me, why did you come so late? - We waited so much for you. - Who asked you to wait? Hey, what's wrong with you? It looks like you had a tiff with someone. When you are sulky, you look like a real monkey. - Shyam, will you listen to me? - What is it? When you sulk, you look exactly like a monkey. I'm in no mood for jokes, Laaj. Good Lord. You think this is a joke? Just look at your face in the mirror... you look really funny. Laaj, come on. - Come on, Shyam. - You go. Don't bore me. Is this a season to sulk, crazy one? The season of love comes only by chance Is this a season to sulk, crazy one? Look at the rains shimmy and sway I've let loose my damp curls Listen to me, oh simple one Oh my simpleton, listen... Look, the season of Spring doesn't stay forever Is this a season to sulk, crazy one? The season of love comes only by chance Is this a season to sulk, crazy one? These songs of my heartbeats The stories told by loving glances Do listen to these, oh crazy one Oh crazy one, what would you know of these? Where will you find such a tranquil age? Is this any season to sulk, crazy one? The season of love comes only by chance Is this any season to sulk, crazy one? Please let your heart unite with mine Turn your eyes towards me Oh beloved, drop it... drop this pretence, my beloved What if this season of love passes us by? Is this a season to sulk, crazy one? The season of love comes only by chance Is this a season to sulk, crazy one? - Laaj... - Huh? He talks! Tell me. - It would be best, for both our sakes... - Yes? - ...to stop meeting. Stop meeting? Okay. And break-up forever. Forever? Okay, that's acceptable too. Laaj, what's the point of us meeting when we can't get married? Who says... no, you're right. There's no point at all. Why don't you understand? I'm stupid. How can I understand? Listen, Laaj. It's wrong of us to meet when your father hasn't consented to our marriage. It's pointless, it's wrong, Laaj. Don't say that, Shyam. You're breaking my heart. We can't run away from the truth, Laaj. We can never get married. Then you tell me, what do we do now? What can I say, Laaj? There's a solution... but you cannot do it, Laaj. Test me whenever you wish... I can do anything for you, Shyam. Then, let's elope today, Laaj... and get married somewhere else. Shyam, I'm prepared to go with you. I don't understand a thing. Doctor, what will happen to Laaj? Shankarlal, will you listen to me or just continue to talk? Sit. The boy has agreed. He's such a nice boy. He said, "You're my elder. I'll do exactly as you say." Shankarlal, it's very difficult to find such boys nowadays. It's not the boy I'm thinking of, Doctor. - But my daughter, Laaj... - isn't Laaj like my daughter too? I care for her too. You just have to go to Bangalore once to meet his mother. I can go whenever you want me to. Go by plane tomorrow morning. Talk to his mother, fix the marriage and return the day after. I'll give you a letter of introduction to give her. - Alright. - Get ready to leave... The boy and I will meet you at the airport tomorrow morning. I'd have brought him today itself but he has the night shift. But I also have to inform Laaj of this matter. There's no need to tell Laaj. Whatever we're doing is for her good. Hey, Pappu? Sister, why are you so late? I can't fall sleep. I've come, now go to sleep. My dear, wake me up at 5 a.m. I've to go to Bangalore by the morning flight. Listen. Sit. My dear. It's possible that the decision I'm making about your life... may convince you that I'm a bad person. Perhaps you will even hate me. But, my dear, all I want to tell you is... to have faith in me. What I'm doing is for your own good. Go, my dear Go to sleep. Laaj, did anyone see you leaving? No. But I'm scared, Shyam. What's there to be afraid of? Everything will be fine once we reach Delhi. Please speak softly. I hope he didn't hear. You're unnecessarily worrying. He's sleeping. - What's in this? - The necklace that I brought from home. - Take care of it. - Only a necklace? - Yes. I didn't bring anything else. - But, Laaj... - how will one necklace suffice? - It's very valuable, made of real pearls. Mother used to say it's worth Rs10,000. I'm ashamed that I have to take the necklace from you. - I won't be able to sell it. - There you go again. When you have enough money, buy me a new one. Laaj, I'll just go buy some cigarettes. Buy them at Bombay Central. It's available right here. I'll be back soon. - What if the train leaves? - Don't worry, I'll be back in time. One packet Capstan. Why did you have to pull the chain? I'd boarded the next car. I didn't pull the chain. Someone else must have. Come on. Laaj, you look very worried. My heart skipped a beat when the train moved and you hadn't returned. Laaj, I was just buying cigarettes, when the train left. I couldn't reach this car. For a moment I felt as if someone had given me a rude shock. I'll continue to be afraid until we reach Delhi. You've sent a telegram to your family, haven't you? Telegram? What telegram? To inform them of our arrival? So they can meet us at the station? Oh? To inform them we're coming? I've already sent that. Laaj, mother will be very happy to see you. You don't know my mother, Laaj. She's great. Some guys have all the luck. Others don't even get crumbs. Will I always remain a bachelor? Just look at your face! My parents find my face adorable. I wonder why girls look at me and feel embarrassed. Anyway, I'll surely find some shameless woman or the other. - What? - Nothing. Forget all that. Tell me about you. What have you done? - You have a nice face, right? - Yes, thankfully. - Thankfully, indeed. Then why doesn't any girl like you? Why don't you fall for someone? What do I say about my heart? Why? My heart is just a vagabond My heart is just a vagabond Who knows whom it will settle on Pretty girls beckoned, even embraced me They tried to coax me but my heart wouldn't listen It's too innocent, poor thing Who knows whom it will settle for My heart is just a vagabond Who knows whom it will settle on My strange, crazed heart has neither hearth nor home It's estranged from the earth, separated from the skies My heart's a falling star Who knows whom it will fall for My heart is just a vagabond Who knows whom it will settle on It has seen the whole world. It is everyone's refuge But my heart remained mine, never belonged to anyone else This gypsy heart is on a journey Who knows its journey's end? My heart is just a vagabond Who knows whom it will settle on When I fell in love, no priest could be found My heart lost its gamble just when it staked its all Rejected by the whole world Who knows if it will ever find anyone My heart is just a vagabond Who knows whom it will settle on Hey Gopi, have the boy and girl left? - Yes. - Come on, let's follow them. - Why? - Why don't you understand? This girl has stolen jewelry from home and eloped with this guy. We may get a sensational story for our newspaper. What do I care about the story, huh? Look Gopi, if I don't file a story today, the editor will sack me. Listen, I've some urgent work at the National Studio, - you follow them. - Fine. I'll go then. Two first class tickets to Ahmedabad. How long before the train leaves? Only 3 minutes. Why doesn't it leave? I'm frightened to death. When father wakes up in the morning, what will he go through? And who will get the children ready for school? You're worrying unnecessarily. Once the train moves, you will be fine. My God, Laaj! Your doctor uncle... Quick! Hide in the bathroom. Wretched man. Don't you dare touch me. Wonderful! I save your life and get threats in return? - Stop that man. - Which man? That man who's running away. Quick, I say! Am I your servant? If you want my help, beg me, request me, say 'please'. May I ask who that man is? Just stop him. I'm not in favor of stopping a man who can leave a beautiful girl like you. He's vanished. Absolutely disappeared. Just like horns from a donkey's head. Actually, today's lovers love the girl's jewelry more than they love the girl. The man seems honest to me. He left you and took what he wanted. Anyway, what's the point in crying over spilled milk? You can't climb over this railing without help. I don't need your help. Your wish. Watching your attempt to climb these railings reminds me of my college days. What lively days. When I returned late at night, I'd climb my hostel walls this way. It seems you've never stayed in a hostel. No wonder you can't climb the railing. Total ignoramus! For God's sake, help me. Please. That's more like it, no? Come here. He must have gone this way. Sardar saab, did a man hire a taxi here just now? Everybody hires taxis here, sir. But whom are you talking about? I'm asking about the man who hired the taxi ahead of yours. It's night time. Who can see clearly? He... He was carrying a bag. Miss, he was definitely carrying something. He came in a hurry, sat in the taxi and left. - Which way did he go? - God alone knows. Did you notice the license number? Number? No, sir, I didn't. The taxi's model? What model was it? It was an Austin... uh, a Hillman... It was some 'man'. - Any other clue? - I know the driver. So then tell me where he lives, where's his house? I can tell you that, sir, but what's the problem? He's a family man. There's no problem, Sardar saab. We're following his passenger. Just tell me, when does he return home? It's time for him to return the cab. If he doesn't get a passenger, he'll head straight home. - Suppose he finds one, then? - He may not return till tomorrow. If you want to take a chance, then come with me right now. I'll show you his house. That's great. Why didn't you say so before? Come, sir, come. Let's take a chance. Very well, sir. Let's leave right away. Forgive me, perhaps you... uh... lost your friend because of me. - What's your name? - Nothing. That's a nice name. Where do you live? - Nowhere. - That's a nice place, too. Who was that boy? - I can't tell you anything. - Then that's the best. Where were you going with him? To hell. If there are beautiful girls like you in hell, may I come there? My name is Kashyap. Prannath Kashyap. - I have no desire to know. - But I yearn to tell you. My name is old-fashioned, but meaningful. If you wish, you may call me 'Nath' (Lord). Okay? Are you driving a taxi or a goods train? Can't you go faster? I drive a taxi, miss, not an aeroplane. How can I drive faster than this? Absolutely right, Sardar saab. Don't go above 30mph or the cops will give you a ticket. Even if you get a ticket, I'm willing to pay the fine. Sardar saab, a sensible man will rarely trust a woman's word. - But, it's your call. - Well said, sir. - You're absolutely right. How can I believe you, miss? - Hey, careful! Anyway, forget all this. At least tell me his name. - Whose? - The one who absconded. I can't tell you anything. What's your name? Nothing. Where do you live? Nowhere. Whom are you pursuing? I don't know. At least, madam, let me know what the matter is... what your stories are... - Driver, how much further? - Just a little further, miss. - How much did the necklace cost? - It was very expensive. Necklace? What necklace? I don't know what you're talking about. The one with which that boy absconded. I couldn't hear its price in the local train. - He didn't absond with the necklace. - Then why are you pursuing him? I have some urgent work with him. Fortunate indeed is that boy whom a beautiful girl like you is pursuing. My tragedy is that I have run after girls all my life. But no girl has ever run after me. Anyway, forget that. What work do you have with that respectable man? - What's it to you? - Nothing. I simply want to know if I'm... running with a thief or after one. Think whatever you want. - Please wait, sir. I'll go and enquire. - Very well. - Greetings! - Greetings. Has Banta Singh returned? Please sit. He'll come soon. - Who are those two love birds? - Do be quiet. They're my passengers. Why do you look so worried? - Why, what's the matter? - Shh... The problem is that the boy doesn't know the girl. They're pursuing someone. From their conversation, I gathered that a necklace has been stolen. What if it becomes a police case? I wanted to ask you what I should do. Why should you be afraid? Go ask the boy who the girl is. If he doesn't answer, call me. I'll take them to the police station. Okay, that seems best. I'll go ask him who the girl is. Sir, Banta Singh hasn't returned. He should be on his way. Sir, would you please come out for a moment? - What's the matter, Sardarji? - It's very hot. It's hot? You called me out to say this? Listen, please come over here for a minute. It's like this... I'm a little suspicious. - Look sir, I'm a poor taxi driver... - Yes? - ...and I... Yes, what is it, Sardarji? - Let me ask you one question. - Ask two. Who is she? Sardarji, she is a... uh... a girl. A girl? Even I know that. But who is she? - She's that one. - That one? - The one. - The one? - Yes. She's the one, indeed... it is she Look, look at her carefully She's the one, indeed... it is she You must have heard this tale in the village square That a king was trapped in a fairy's spell That fairy has returned with a new face Look, look at her carefully She's the one, indeed, it is she You may remember what the poets have said Folks with innocent faces may yet be executioners They have no hearts but those that are made of stone Look, look at her carefully She's the one, indeed, it is she She is the one for whom Farhad gave his life In whose memory, weeping, Majnu roamed the jungles Romeo breathed his last in her desire Look, look at her carefully She's the one, indeed, it is she You may call this a joke, but it's true There's something that makes her wander the streets with me What more can I say? You've to understand the rest Look, look at her carefully She's the one, indeed, it is she - Yes, that's the one. - Who? The boy with the bag? - Yes, he. - I dropped him off at National Studio. - Then, Sardarji, please take us there. - Please sit. You? Here? At this hour? What can I do, my love? I can't stay away from you. I'd warned you earlier, too, not to come to the studio. You will surely malign me. I've told you often enough to quit films and marry me. I've no desire to starve to death. I'll keep you like a queen. You only know how to talk. I'd told you, some day, I would erase all your grievances. Close your eyes. Please? These are real pearls. Do you know their worth? Rs10,000. - How much is it? - Re.1 and 3 annas. Re.1 and 3 annas. Here's Rs5. Give the rest to the other Sardarji... - in whose taxi we came to your house. - Okay. Please wait here. I'll look for him in the studio. He shouldn't spot you and hide somewhere. Don't worry, I'll be back soon. You don't know these nice girls; they will die before they breathe a word. If you ask me, she must have returned home by now... and must be crying her heart out. Still, Shyam, keeping this necklace with us is dangerous. Why don't we sell it and with the money... Get married, right? I know a jeweler. Excuse me, sir, does a Mr. Shyam work in this studio? The time? I have no watch. I'm asking about Mr. Sham, not the time. - Give me a matchbox. - A matchbox? Matches? Oh, yes, matches. Here, take them. Yes, take it in your hand. - Give me a cigar. - I don't have a cigar. I've cigarettes. - Give me a cigar. - Here, take a cigarette. Take the cigarette also in your hand. As I was saying, sir, I'm looking for a man. You're looking for a job? There are no jobs here. Search elsewhere. Not a job. I'm looking for a boy. A girl? Is she beautiful? Not a girl. A boy! Hey, sir, why do you get angry? I'm slightly hard of hearing... Which department does he work in? Ah, now you're talking! I don't know the department, but he's in the studio. Search Stage No. 2. - Where? - Find it. Where is this Stage No. 2? My name? My name is Motiram. I'm not asking your name. I'm asking about Stage No. 2. Where's it? - Go there. - Then say so. Mr. Motiram, get me through to this number. There's been no call for you. - Uff! I didn't ask about incoming calls. I want to make a call. Yes, I heard. Which number do you want? Hey, forget that. Come in. Kashyap, what are you doing here? And whose picture were you taking? I needed some snaps of the shooting for my newspaper, that's why I'm here. - But what are you doing here? - I'm stuck in a strange dilemma. Remember that couple sitting behind us in the train? - That Romeo and Juliet? - Yes, the very same. That Romeo absconded with Juliet's necklace. Absconded? Weren't they eloping together on the train? - How did the girl get left behind? - Today's Romeos don't stay for long. Hmm, so what? If Romeo absconds with the necklace, you elope with Juliet. - But where is she? - She's waiting outside. Outside? Okay... sorry... I'll be back soon. It's a joke for you; that poor girl is terrified. So? I've learned the boy has come to this studio with the necklace. - To the studio? - Yes, do one thing. Somehow, find him... - and keep an eye on him. I'll fetch the police. - Okay. You fetch the police. I'll leave. - Joking again? - No, you get the police, I'll find him. - Happy now? - Yes. - Any news? - Nothing. I tried my best. It's such a big studio. He may be hiding inside. Come along. - Where? - Police station. - Police station? - Yes, it's impossible to find him without the police's help. The police will search the studio and arrest him if he's inside. - Come. Let's not waste time. - Please wait. Why go to the police for such a petty matter? It's a waste of time. Amazing. That man has run away with your necklace... and you don't even want to report it to the police. If you didn't want the necklace back, why did we run around so much? You wasted my time, too. I apologize for the trouble you went through for me. Look, that's not the issue. You seem to be from a decent family. And you're in trouble. Believe me, I want to help you get out of it. Please tell me - what's all this? I can't say anything, can't tell you anything. Listen! Then let me take you home. It's late, and it's not right for you to go alone. Don't worry about me. I'll go home on my own. - But... alone... so late... - I told you I don't want to go with you. Let me go. Whatever I'm doing is for your own good. Sister, where did you go so late? I couldn't fall sleep. I can't do a thing without you. You seem to be a girl from a decent family. What will happen to this house when you get married? Hey, mister, what's happening? Nothing, constable. She slipped on the staircase and fell. - What's the problem? - Problem? Nothing, constable. We live close by. We came out for a stroll. Fact is, she's been unwell for awhile... - and she felt dizzy, and fell down. - Fell? - Yes. - Who are you? - Me? I am... we are... Er... she's my wife. - And I'm Prannath. - Who? - Her Prannath. - Who are you? - He's our constable, the constable. He was just asking about you. - Nath? - Nath? - She always calls me Nath. That's why. Take her home quickly or she'll catch a cold. Yes, I agree. You go. I was afraid you'd do something like this. That's why I followed you. Why did you rescue me? lt'd have been better if I had died. How can I face father? No. I won't go home. I can't face father. I'll die. I won't go home. Let me drown. Let me go. Let me drown. - What are you doing? - I told you I won't go home. Let me go. - I won't go. - No? Sit here. If you were to die like this, how would your father face the world? Committing suicide doesn't solve your problems. - I hope you aren't hurt? - No. When father finds out about all this, what will he go through? People in the neighborhood will make my life difficult. Don't worry. Everything will be fine. Who was that boy? Why did you run away with him? What's his name? Shyam. Shyam Khanna. Father was going to fix my marriage elsewhere, and I loved Shyam. I believed his lies and left home. I took the necklace from home at his behest. How was I to know he would deceive me like this? Damn. Why hasn't he come yet? I don't understand where he might be. I'll phone him again. It's 11:45 now. You have to awaken your father at exactly 5a.m. If we try our best, it won't be difficult to find him by then. If we don't find the necklace, how will I go home? Finding the necklace is my job. - Greetings. - Greetings, sir. What's the matter? We are a bit... drenched. It's not raining, sir. How did you get drenched? Well, it so happened we... we were walking, and someone threw water from above us. And we were drenched. Right? It looks like they threw a lot of water on you. Please have these clothes dried and ironed quickly. And until then, please give us something else to wear. Sir, it will cost a rupee each to have them dried and ironed. Sure. Charge a rupee each. Here's two rupees. - They're wet. Dry them too. - Here, Sawariya. And listen... bring them something to wear. I'm freezing to death. Before jumping in, you should have checked... to see if the water was cold or warm. Here, sir, clothes for both of you. Go inside and change. - Together? - No, nearby. What I mean is, a curtain... in the middle. - Here? - Yes. - And you? - You... here. And I... will be here. Is that okay? It'll have to do. You haven't told me your name. - I am Laaj. - 'Laaj'(shy)? Is that why you're always overcome by shyness? You do remember my name, don't you? Your parents have named you incorrectly. You should have been named Hemant Kumar (the singer) instead. Tell me, where did you learn to sing? - Did you like it? - Yes. Somewhat. Tell me, why were you making faces at me while singing? I was very angry. And now? I don't know. Who's there at home? No one right now, but very soon... Will your family arrive? You're amazing. Here I am, still unmarried, and you talk of children? Fact is, I've never met a girl whom I wanted to marry. I'm sorry, I thought you were married. So tell me, why haven't you married yet? What to do? I never fell in love. But, now... - Now what? - I've begun to like someone. - Who is she? - There is someone. - How is she? - She is beautiful... but a bit temperamental. - How long have you known her? - She's a recent acquaintance. Where does she live? She used to live elsewhere before, but now, she resides in my heart. Fortunate is that girl who resides in your heart. But the fun begins only when I reside in her heart as well. Why don't you ask her? I told you she's a bit temperamental, so I'm slightly... - scared. - You're a coward? She won't eat you. Who knows? Look at my predicament My gait has changed Look, I've turned sixteen When I look at the moon and the stars, dear sir I have no control Seems like the Spring nights have spread their magic Really? This transient youth... is strangely intoxicating Crazed by the whispers of Spring They spoke of my predicament... my wayward tresses Look, I've turned sixteen When I walk the path alone Thousands of handsome young men Cry out, 'take our hearts oh doe-eyed one' I see! Snapping the strings of reason The fair lady stepped out so furtively. Why, oh doe-eyed one? This straightforward gait... has become wayward Look, I've turned sixteen I was innocent Till his intoxicating... eyes cast its spell despite my tears Beware, fair lady The world is crazy about you As you meet their gaze... or step towards them, tread carefully 'Tis a wondrous age... the age of understanding Look, I've turned sixteen The ways of men are shabby Their gaze, deceitful And on their lips are false pledges of love Understood, sir? Forget these tales, fair one Look how beautiful is... this season of intoxication, this night of love Those with whom I share my plight... they lay the snare Look, I turned sixteen Look, she has turned sixteen How long have you known this washerwoman? I saw her for the first time in my life today. Oh? So that's why you mingled so closely with her and sang along. I was singing to entertain you. I was also watching the person who was being entertained by you. This washerwoman was very pretty, and she dances like lightning. What do you think? Let me ask you, sir, do you do anything else in life other than sing? At times, you're singing in a moving train... sometimes in front of taxi drivers or with washerwomen Have you no 'laaj' (shame)? If this 'Laaj' would come into my life, what more could I ask for? The fact is, since I first saw you, I feel like... singing forever. Who told you that only songs can express what the heart feels? It's not about conversation; this is business. Where's the necklace? The necklace is still with that fool. He wants to sell it to you and marry me. All my sympathies are with him. Listen. Shyam, meet him. He's Mr. Biharilal, the city's most eminent jeweler. - I met him here. - Please sit. Mr. Shyam, do you also work in films? No, I... What do I say? The truth is, Mr. Biharilal, the necklace I referred to... during our telephone call, belongs to him. And he wants to sell it. I thought it's such a beautiful piece... why not sell it to you? It's very kind of you to... have so much respect for me. Where's the necklace? Here it is. You definitely know how to fool someone, Miss Neena. Your performance is fantastic. Now show me the real necklace. - Real one? - This is the genuine piece. Mr. Shyam, you said you don't work in films. And you're acting too? - This necklace is made of fake pearls. - Fake pearls? How can that be? This is valued at Rs.10,000. Mr. Shyam, this isn't worth even 10 cowries (shells). Mr. Biharilal, perhaps you made a mistake in testing this? Hmm... perhaps, after this, you will say... that all my life, I've been dealing not with diamonds, but with pebbles. My dear sir, I can spot a gem anywhere. But when it is a pebble, how can I say it's a diamond? My only regret is that... the pearl I was sizing up at home, I may have lost that deal. Anyway, Miss. Neena, I can do anything for you. I'll leave. Don't. The necklace is fake? Neena? I'll show him out. As far as I'm concerned, this is a genuine pearl necklace. Madam, the shot is ready. Please wear the dance costume. Yesterday, I gave such a great shot that Mehboob saab was speechless. Then, what can I say? He shot a scene with me and Nargis. Then? I opened my eyes. And what do I see? I'm lying beneath the cot and the mattress is on top of me. What are you all doing here? Go to the sets. We need a boy and girl on the set. Do I carry them in my pocket? Get lost. Okay. This is the studio. How will we find him in such a big studio? When I came here earlier, I asked my friend, Gogi, to trace him. It's possible he may have found him. Who's Gogi? Gogi... that... uh... short, stout man, who was playing the harmonica? Hey, mister, would you two like to apply makeup? - Makeup? - Yes. Makeup. Haven't you ever applied makeup? Oh, makeup? Of course we have, many times. Quite a few times, but we're new here. I see. Come with me. What's all this? What's he talking about? I think he was waiting for someone else; he just grabbed us instead. - But I've never acted in films. - As if I have. - What now? - Please don't worry. I'll fix everything. In fact, it's good that we so easily got a chance to look for Shyam. - Where's your friend Gogi? - He must be somewhere here. Hey, do this love scene later. - Come with me. - Sure. Let's go. I was given so much respect in Madras. I used to work in Gemini Studios; in Chandralekha, I sat on a swing... how I swung from here to there. I swung so well. - What's going on? - Who let you...? - Sorry, Mr. Assistant. - Dada, you have to do their makeup. - A beard and moustache for him. - And her? Just let her be. - Listen, Director Sir... - You bore me daily. - Please sit down. Look, they have just arrived and you're giving them a beard. - Give me a chance too. - What do you want? - Shall I give you a beard? - No, sir. I'm not talking about a beard. Give me a chance too. What do I lack? Let me show you how well I can dance. Watch. Please watch now. Sit carefully, okay? Enough, enough, enough! Let me sing for you. Listen, how well I sing. My breath is coming fast. It's okay, no problem. Let's dance with joy, and sing... [singing in Tamil] Enough, stop it. This won't do here. Then I'll sing in Hindi. A Lata Mangeshkar song from the film New Delhi. Your flute... Your flute has become my enemy, Lord Krishna your flute has become my enemy Lord Krishna... your flute has become my enemy You seduced me by feigning love Now, o faithless one, you follow me all the time Now, my eyes... - Did you like it? - Forget about acting... we'll take you as a singer. Go. - Sure. How nice you are! - Dada, be quick. Why are you staring at me? Those same lips, the same style, the same eyes. The same action. You're just like [the actor] Dilip Kumar. Oh, like 'Babul' in Dilip Kumar... sorry, Dilip Kumar in the film 'Babul'... looked at me just like this. My heart beats began to quicken. And then, when I returned his gaze, he fell ill for eight days. The director would lift him up and sprinkle water on his face. He'd come to his senses, look at me and then faint again. And this continued to happen, again and again. I've done your bidding, my love. Now, give me my share. For what? I too have a claim on this necklace. On a fake pearl necklace? I have to admire your style. Do you know this is worth more than Rs10,000? Didn't you say this isn't worth anything at all? That estimation was only for that idiot's benefit. But I'm not that foolish. Madam, go to the set. - May I go? - Go. Don't worry. I'll find Shyam and meet you on the set. Go. How many chances do you get to apply makeup each month? Actually, I get many opportunities. But I haven't got a major breakthrough. Perhaps today is my lucky day. Where is Stage No.2? What's your name? - Mine? - Yes. - Laaj. My word. Why do you talk with downcast eyes? People here call me Pehalwan. I've been in this profession for 10 years. But, I swear to God, I've never seen a lovelier face. You look like Madhubala [ the actress]. The director? He knows me. I'll ask him to cast you as the supporting actress. But when the day's shooting ends... What is it, Pehalwan? What's happening here? Disgusting! You see a lone girl and tease her. Don't you dare tease a girl again, understand? I'll tear your car... sorry, your beard and put it into your pocket. Get out. I said, go, you rascal! Miss, miss, don't be afraid. He's a 'pehalwan' (wrestler) only in name. If I squint at him sternly, he will be out of action for 36 days. Miss, are you new here? Where is Stage No.2? Opposite my house... sorry, uh, it's just across from here, miss. Go. Excuse me, sir, where's Stage No.2? I don't know. I'm asking about Stage No.2. I told you I don't know. This way or that? Are you asking directions or intimidating me? I don't know! If you know, then do tell me. You are troubling me like a beggar. Forgive me. I don't know! - I'm sporting a disguise. - But why? - To catch that thief. - But where's the police? I couldn't fetch them. Where's the thief? I saw the thief in the dancer Neena's room. Where's that makeup room? Makeup room? Uh, yes, over there. No, not inside there. A little to the side. Yes, that's fine. - Not there. - Sir, where do I sit? Tell me. I told you, go sit there. Yes, that's fine. Hey, what's wrong with you? Oh, you're here? Please sit. - Where's your friend? - He must be on his way. Oh. Can you dance? - Pardon? - Dance? Ballroom dance? - Yes, a little. - A little? Will do. Hello. May I? Who are you? What do you want? Necklace. Which necklace? Do I have to tell you? Give it to me quietly, or it may be that the police... Why was this necessary? Anyway, since you've started it, I'll have to end it. Should I break your bones or will you tell me where the necklace is? I'll tell you. But let go of me. Leave me. The necklace is made of fake pearls. - Stop talking rubbish. - I speak the truth. I swear. Neena called a jeweler here and showed it to him. He proved the necklace is made of fake pearls. - Fake pearls? - Yes. Fool. Neena and the jeweler have conned you. Do you know the price of that necklace? Rs. 10,000. - Where is it? - With Neena. - Where's Neena? - At the set. Hurry up. Put on me No. 12. - Go quickly. - Call Agnes. - Agnes! - Hello, Neena. - Hello. - You haven't worn your earrings? I'll put them on now. This necklace is beautiful. It's mine. - Are they expensive? - No. They're fake pearls. Bloody jeweler. Tell me the truth. Was the necklace real or fake? Real, absolutely genuine. Why did you lie to me then? I'll tell you why later. But right now, she has made a fool of both of us. So, what are your intentions? You want her to get away with it or retrieve the necklace? What do you suggest? The girl is on the set, and the necklace is around her neck. Obviously, we should both be there. Removing the necklace is your job... and mine is to give you Rs.5,000. 5,000? It's actually worth Rs.10,000. Stolen objects are valued differently. Do you accept? Let's go. Miss Neena, let's have a photograph. Please. Who are you? - Hurry up, please. - Thank you. Please look to the side. Please smile. Hmm... Give me a dance pose. No... I think the photo will be better if you remove the necklace. - Meaning? - I mean that beauty isn't dependent on jewelry. Give me the necklace. I'll return it once I click the photo. If you want to take a photo, then take it like this. And hurry up. Listen. The moment the playback begins, get up and start dancing. Won't you sing here? Do you think I'm a professional singer? You are quite good-looking. If the directors here like your voice, they'll make you a hero. I'm not interested in becoming a hero. The heroine is here, but... the hero is nowhere in sight. You are blushing. Perhaps due to the make-up. You look like a real bandit. Maybe because of the moustache? Cut! No, no, no! You aren't doing it right. The dance we're shooting is a New Year dance. And like the custom on New Year's, the lights will be switched off after the dance. Clap, wish each other Happy New Year, etc., in the dark. And listen. The lights will be switched off only for a minute. And during this time, don't forget to applaud or wish others. Those eyes flash like daggers Those eyes flash like daggers, oh lord They wound me here, and here, and here The day was passing... and I was ready to leave My lover and I exchanged glances Our eyes met Our eyes had to meet but once I was wounded here, and here and here Those eyes flash like daggers, oh lord They wound me here, and here, and here What could I do... when he said... "I'm ensnared by your eyes... please, stay awhile" I hesitated, 'Should I stay?', when... I was wounded here, and here, and here Those eyes flash like daggers, oh lord They wound me here, and here, and here Tell me... have you ever seen... a gathering, all wounded and trembling? It's not just me I'm not the only one who was hurt They were wounded, oh, they were wounded too Those eyes flash ike daggers, oh lord, They wounded me here and here, and here My necklace. Who are you? Thief. Catch him. Thief. Will you hand over the necklace, or shall we have an encore of our fight? I'll give it. I got it only for you. One of the two men fighting there has the necklace. Inspector Sharma, surround the place. I don't understand how such a theft can occur in the studio. Neena, perhaps you can guess. Mr. Raj, the police have surrounded the place They're chasing him on the terrace. He'll be caught soon. There he is! Check the mains. What's wrong, Pehalwan? The main switch has been shut. There's some problem. What's happening? Please tell me. Constable. Here, take this necklace and go quickly. Get a taxi. You'll get home in time. - And you? - Don't worry. I'll have to deal with the police. - Police? - Search near the wall. But... but I can't leave you like this. Please listen to me and go away. If I leave here with the necklace, the cops will arrest you for its theft. Please allow me to fulfill my promise. I'll be satisfied if you reach home in time with the necklace. Why don't you understand? If I leave, the police will arrest you. Your self-respect is at stake. And if you don't go, what about your honor? You tried to commit suicide for this. Get down. Neena, why didn't you tell me earlier that the necklace cost Rs.10,000? Sir, he's the man who escaped with the necklace. - Where's the necklace? - Inspector, I have the necklace. And it belongs to her. Why, Ms. Neena, didn't you say the necklace belonged to you? Pardon? - Well... - Neena! - Mr. Shyam! Please speak without fear. Shyam gave it to me. Mr. Shyam, what's all this? Inspector... lnspector, this man was trying to escape. I wasn't trying to escape but to leave. Inspector, he's the jeweler who connived with Neena to cheat me. Inspector, I was called here to strike a deal for the necklace. Yes. You were called to declare the real necklace a fake. Inspector, I swear the necklace belongs to her. I don't know anything. All of you come to the police station. - Come on, Mr. Sharma. - Inspector, I want to tell you something. Whatever you want to say, say it at the police station. What are you thinking? If I hadn't met you today, I wonder what would have happened. When are you getting engaged? Father is leaving today morning. It will happen in a couple of days. Have you seen the boy to whom you are getting engaged? No. What does he do? I don't know. What do you do? I wander around in search of stories. - What? - I'm a journalist. I write for Bharat Times. Will you publish today's incident in your newspaper? Not now. When I followed you at Bombay Central railway station, I thought I may get a story for my newspaper. Where will you find a truer, stranger story than this? Had it been any other girl, I'd surely have published it. Driver, please stop here. So, I have fulfilled my promise. I've brought you back home with the necklace before 5 'o clock. I have to confess it pains me to separate from you. Perhaps it grieves me more than it does you. But I have begun to love life because of this exquisite pain. I met you 6 hours ago. But it feels like I've known you for 6,000 years. Why didn't you meet me a few days earlier, hmm? I could ask you the same question. We couldn't be further apart, despite being so close together. Perhaps this is what is called Fate. My only wish is that, wherever you are, you remain happy, prosperous. And you? Meeting you is a source of joy, 'tis true Meeting you leaves me overcome by grief. My heart is a vagabond Who knows whom it will settle on? Never stopping, never still Chasing unknown melodies Wavering between choices And beaten, wanders door-to-door Who knows whom it will settle on? My heart is a vagabond Who knows whom it will settle on? It met someone But is puzzled by what happened Was it a wakeful moment? Or perhaps just a dream Left desolate in its own pain Who knows whom it will settle on? My heart is a vagabond Who knows whom it will settle on? My heart is a vagabond Who knows whom it will settle on Father, it's 5 o'clock. It's 5 o'clock? My dear, send Ramu with a cup of tea for me. - Tea? - Yes, tea. You go and get ready too. - Me too, father? - Yes. Won't you come see me off? It's time for the flight to leave, but there's no sign of your doctor uncle. My dear, the boy you are going to marry... is also coming with him. The boy is very nice. I like him very much. Yet, I would like you... to see him once, meet him once. There they come. Why did you stop? What's wrong? Hey, Doctor saab, it's she! What? Don't you like the boy? Thank God. It's she, indeed. It's she? You've already met Shankarlal. This is his daughter, Laaj. Greet him, my dear. Very pleased to meet you. But, why were you both delayed? Fact is, I was saddled with such a responsibilty last night... I didn't get the chance to even take a nap. What's the matter with you, my dear? I don't understand anything, father. You'll figure it out soon enough. At which college do you study? Laaj studies at National College. She's a very bright student. She's won quite a few prizes for singing and dancing. I'm fond of singing too. In fact, people often tease me, saying... that my parents should have named me Hemant Kumar. What's the matter, my dear? Are you all right? It's nothing, father. Okay, my dear. Look after the house. I'll return the day after tomorrow. Kashyap, should I convey any message to your mother? Just tell her that... uh... uh... that I'm very happy. All right. You may call it a joke, but it's true There's something that makes her wander the streets with me What more can I say? You have to understand the rest Look, look at her carefully She's the one, indeed, it is she It is she!
