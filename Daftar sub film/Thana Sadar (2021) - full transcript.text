It's a new house. -I won't be able to stay alone. -Okay. You don't look good when you are upset. It's not me, but my experience says it. Common people have two eyes But Punjab police has a third eye. I can quickly recognize a crook Sir, you couldn't see Fuman Singh. -I couldn't see your third eye. -Keep quiet. Mr. Teja Singh, you are in a police station not at a street. You must understand the situation before speaking anything. Beware. -Keep quiet. Sir is here. -Huh? Welcome, sir. -Welcome, sir. -You... For me! Oh! Sir. -Sir, we need to oil this fan. -Not only fan We have to maintain a lot of things here. -Mr. Mela Singh. -Yes. Be a little attentive towards the condition of this police station. If you can't respect this place... -...then at least don't disrespect this place. -Yes. Sir, the condition of Punjab Police... ...is no different from this police station. You know it better. Is this the only staff we have? Mr. Mela Singh, I find this police station empty. It is obvious for you to find it empty, sir. Sixteen officers are gone for their VIP duty. Four members of staff are gone for summons and passport enquiry. Others are posted at the roads managing traffic. Sir, this is the condition of this police station. If we need to go for an emergency raid... ...we have to make our cook wear a uniform and take as a staff. Sir, if you want to know the truth... I got this girl here to welcome you. She belongs to the other police station. What can we do, sir? We are helpless. Everyone can work in favorable conditions. But a real officer make everything work in worst conditions. Sir, there is a limit to make conditions worse. Every time we arrest a big criminal... ...we get calls from white-collar people. It gets difficult to protect our dignity. What we write in report is not true. -We can't write the truth. -Gurubaksh Singh. Only weak people go with the flow. I don't know how you guys have been doing your duty so far. But from now you won't do anything that would make you look down. -Understand? -Yes, sir. -You can go now. -Okay, sir. -Gurubaksh Singh. -Yes, sir. -I want the list of pending cases in this police station. -Yes, sir. Teja! Sir has started saying book quotes. We get to listen all these things during our trainings. Sir, my uncle's son... ...was with sir in Mator police station. He said he is Iron man -He never backs down. -Teja Singh. Salt water can rot an iron. Yes. -Mela Singh, take this. -Yes, sir. Get all the things required here. Make this police station a better place. -Punjab police will also improve. -Great, sir. Who is there in the jail? He is from a gang of motor thieves. He is on remand. We found the robbed material. We have to take it in custody. I have told the chief. -They must have assigned this duty to someone. -Let's go. -I will get a tour of the area. -As you wish, sir. Sir.

Chief take us to Dukke's motor. -Yes, sir. -Come on. -Mr. Village-head, are you okay? -Yes. Okay, sir. Sir, take a turn after tenth house. Stop here. You took a wrong turn. You had to take the next turn. Why did he ran away? That boy...

We are playing cards here. -What motor is this? -Sir, it's Mr. Sarpanch's motor. He is Sarpanch's nephew. He is here. -Are you Gambling here? -No, sir. We are doing time pass. Where did he ran away? He is a coward. He went like a viral video Get up. Get in the car. Sir, they are family. Where are you taking them? We are not taking them anywhere else but their home.

Four of us were drinking This is not right. The alcohol is over and we had no fun. Mr. Sarpanch, fix something. You morons! Do I have ample of money? -I have splurged everything. -So now? Who will sponsor us? Oh no! Someone is here. You fools, He is a bull and not a rooster. What have you done? -He is dead. -Huh! What a trouble! Drop him in the canal and leave. Leave. Listen, Forget whatever has happened here... Specially you As you say. Let's go. Come there. -Mr. Mela Singh. -Sir. -File a report and arrest them. -Sir. What did they do? I don't get it. What do these youngsters do? Mr. Sarpanch, why don't you know about them? You just do politics. Follow the ministers. Your son carries an expensive phone. Did you ask him about it? Look at the clothes Like getting ready for a party Sir, listen to me. Mr. Village-head, take away Mr. Sarpanch. He shouldn't get into this matter. Okay, sir. Let's go, Mr. Sarpanch. Get up.

Bebe, you can share 100 things with me. I think this is the Right time You became an inspector. Bebe, why are you digging out old matters? Why shouldn't I? I lost my brave son. Son, you know it. Bani's father was killed in the farm. Not bearing the pain His wife also died the same day. No one could find what happened. It was raining for 2 days People said ...God also cried on Sarwan's deaths. When police came for investigation and check the dead body due to heavy rain ,they had to investigate on the field cot The inspector said there was no evidence due to rains. They could not find any foot-prints. It's been 12 years son. During every rainy season... ...our family gets upset. Bani never went to the farms after that day. Whose mansion is that? That's mansion of Canadians Have your tea, then we will go to the farms. Ajeet Singh. His corpse was found here. Uncle. Did he have any enemy? My brother was a workaholic.

Cocaine, marijuana, coke... ...heroine, everyone is heard of these drugs. But Punjab police has invented their own drug. It's called powder. This drug is made to ruin lives of guys like me. You get 4 leaves from a medical shop. Add some talcum powder and the drug powder is ready. I was in jail for 2 years because of this powder. What was the matter? It was my sister's wedding. I got 4 cartons if alcohol from outside, because its cheap But police arrested me for drugs Now you tell me, If in the entire province ...alcohol is sold at the same rate... ...why would anyone get alcohol from outside? What should I say about your police department? Leave it. Thank you. Well done Balli ,You nailed it He is true But Sometimes speaking truth can invite problems. -Then u say Nikka Speak -Never Your feelings get you in trouble. Very good, brother! Every gangster gets comments on their posts. I don't say that if you follow a wrong person, you become one. But there is no point in blaming each other. Life gives a second chance to everyone. You can decide whether you want to make it or not. Your youth is like a wave. It can ruin everything if it won't get a direction. My work is to guide you to the right path. It's your wish whether you want to take it or not. Jai Hind. You have great thoughts. You remind of me someone. Anyway. You are doing a good job and keep it up. -I am always with you. -Yes, sir.

Check the phone. Sir, I think you are Sunny Leone's fan. -No, but I am Sunny Deol's father Dharmendra's big fan. -I see. You guys look useful. I want you to work with me, will you? Sir ,Its a old saying That you can neither befriend Police nor you can be their enemy. I don't know why, I feel like trusting you. Trust me. I won't break your trust. See you. Let's go, Rinku. Oh no! You! You wasted my tasty ice-cream. Sir, he has created a din. Arrest them. Mr. Mela Singh, buy another one. No problem. I will buy another one, but you arrest them first. Come here. Yes. Come here.

Sir ,They will create nuisance again What happened? Whose car is this? You are new here. No one would dare to ask this question here. No, brother. He seems to be the new SHO of this city. Do you have the permit? Yes, we do carry the permit. You can't have permission for Tinted glasses -Mr. Mela Singh. -Yes. Remove the Tinted film We are into black business Amazing! But if you were in white powder business I would have beaten you black and blue Hello. '-Hello.' -'What happened? -Nothing, Kids burnt a cracker You have no idea of my power. I sneeze here and it gets heard in Delhi. Mess with me and no one would hear even your screams Mr. Mela Singh, remove his tint film and send him home I think his reputation will be up for toss. Sir here. Today whole body is lazy Help me with some stufg Nathya, I came to you for help and you are asking me for help. We don't get authentic stuff these days. I am managing somehow with Bournvita. What are you doing, brothers? What to do? He gave up today Now you give us some stuff No problem. -Do one thing. Make your special tea. -Tea is ready. It's pure...You made the day No problem. Have it. Today you made the day Take it. I got hot tea. Take it. Whoa! Stop it for a while. Let us have fun first. We are already bad stuff. That day also the stuff was good. That's why... Hey! Why are you speaking alone? He said bubbles will be witness Hello. Sir, You asked for call details I have sent them to Mr.Mela Singh -'Sir, now...' -Balli, don't call me sir. You are like my younger brother to me. You did this for me in 10 minutes. Other would have taken 10 days to do this. Some official tasks are confidential. You too are confidential for me. When you were speaking in Dharamsala I remembered my university days. I too had the same passion. But I promise I will never break your trust. Brother, I hate policemen. But I don't know why I accepted your offer to work. -I am doing it wholeheartedly -I feel some connection... ...with you in this short period of time. Okay. To whom are you expressing your love now?

Sir, Last night rain was unstoppable -It rained that day when Sarwan got murdered -Yes Go, arrest Palla. Paala! Sir, for which crime would we arrest him? Mr. Mela Singh. We can't do everything like Lord Rama did. We have to behave like Lord Krishna to get things done. Jokes don't suit you. Punjab police is asking for a reason to arrest someone. Sir, I get it. Now you will see true colors of Mela Singh. I will get Paala Singh here. Teja Singh. Pala, Here's the stuff Zora has said so. What are you looking at? Hold this stuff. -Get aside. -Listen to me. Mr. Mela Singh, you should retire now. Sir, there was a time... when I used to catch thieves like Jonty Rodes But now I can't. He is gone. Gone. Then Dhoni did well by taking the retirement -Get him. -Arrest him. -Yes, Bebe. -Son, did Paala escape? No, Bebe. I have handcuffed him. He is in the car. See ,Its not easy to escape from Police Yes, sir. Yes. Fine. I will be there. -Mr. Mela Singh. -Yes, sir. I got a call from Deputy sir. I will meet him and come back.

You can meet them. Only their family member or their lawyer. He has no family. He is an alone man. You don't look like a lawyer. The... ...inspector... ...has given policemen lot of powers. I will show you my powers now. He will make a call and show his powers to us. Let's find out. Hello. Sir, I am at the police station. Yes. Hello. Yes, sir. Yes. Yes. Okay, fine. You can meet him.

SSP sir asked us to do Paala's medical test done right away. DSP sir called me. There was no urgent work. Pana Pradhan came here. Who is this Paala? Sir, there is nothing to worry about. We had to do his medical test in the... ...morning anyway. We will get it done now. What did you get from him? Sir, it's nothing much but this watch. Take a tea break for 10 minutes. -Then we will take him for his medical test. -Okay, sir. -Okay, sir. Take this, bro. His movement is in our hand -Mr. Mela Singh. -Yes, sir. -Take Paala out for medical test. Open the door. Keep your eyes down Let's go. Come on. Paala Singh. You know a lot of powerful people.

And now he is talking like a parrot. Give me drugs! Sir, for God's sake... I will die. I have body pain, sir. Yes. You want drugs? Where do you think you are? Keep quiet. Sir. -Get him in the jail. -Put him Sir. Sir, I want to say something. Don't put me in the remand. Sir ,I am an addict Don't beat me up. You can ask me anything here. We will ask in the morning -We have to get a lot out of you. -Sir. I know why you have caught me. Sir. You arrested me for Sarvan's murder case. I killed that... ...innocent man. I will tell you the truth. I am just begging Don't beat me up. I will die. Speak up. Sir. I used to visit Haryana to take stuff. Hey! Police caught him. You won't meet him. Then? Sir. I sneaked out of there. But I didn't go home that day I used to keep drugs in the farms. That day I thought... Sarwan saw me Who is it? Pala, At this hour Hey! Paala! You are not answering did u consume too much stuff Why are you hitting me? What have I done to you? Sarwan, you know my secret now. What secret? I don't know anything, Paala. That's too bad now Elders used to say... ...instead of going to jail under section 307... Don't kill me. One murder ruins two lives I will die... ...but you will also be in the jail for the rest of your life. No one is here. There is no animal around. Who will give a statement against me? Paala, you did wrong. If the universe would want... ...the water bubble will also give some proves. Sir, as we sow, so shall we reap! At the threshold, Zora caught the words I uttered. You were smart enough to catch me. That innocent man's murder ...didn't let me sleep peacefully till date. The universe is very powerful, sir. It proved that the dying man was right. -Mr. Mela Singh. -Yes. Write down his statement. Put him in the jail. Okay. My son got justice today. I feel overwhelmed. God never fails to do justice. Ajit gave me peace today Generally a son is tried to repay a mother's favors. But today, a son did a favor on a mother. -Grandma, I shall hang up. He is home. -Okay. I promised you to take to the farms one day. This is the right time. I never saw God. But I am sure He is like you. "Your company makes me fall in love with you." "Even the fall season feels like the blooming season." "Your company makes me fall in love with you." "Even the fall season feels like the blooming season." I feel like flying. "What magic did you do? I feel passionate." "You are my dream. You always appear in my dreams." "You make me go restless. You bring peace to my heart." "You are my dream. You always appear in my dreams." "You make me go restless. You bring peace to my heart." "God, protect our sweet relationship from evil eyes." Give me a souvenir of love. "I want to keep you close to me only then I will feel good." "I feel the rush in my body when you smile and call me." "You are my dream. You always appear in my dreams." "You make me go restless. You bring peace to my heart." "You are my dream. You always appear in my dreams." "You make me go restless.

I keep an eye on him all the time. We can arrest him in no time. Balli, don't joke. It's a serious matter. We often have to pay dearly for jokes. What about the policeman whose locations you had traced? I have used my connection in Dubai. What's the report? Brother, he has been talking to the DSP. They have been frequenting Canadian House. Okay, fine. Is my character right? No, sir. It's written, is the uniform right? No. I asked you. Paaliya, you are here? My friend you always keep pure stuff. You made the mistake of thinking I am Paala. Moosa isn't a man... ...but an illusion. An illusion. You have messed with the wrong guy. You made a big mistake. But nature doesn't make a mistake. It does. Even nature makes a mistake. Moosa. Paala. The nature has made a mistake by making them same But this Moosa... ...know how to take advantage of the nature's mistake. Joriya, may I say something? You are an amazing guy. But alas! Those who see Moosa's face... ...they can't live. They are hungry. I can't bear to see animals hungry. -Paala. -Not Paala. Your friend Moosa. Other! -Listen. -Yes? -You buy the goods, I will make a call. What is the matter? You look worried? I am worried. I will talk to sir and get rid of my burden. Why are you talking so rudely? Enough of talking. Now I have taken a decision. In the battle of honesty and dishonesty, I chose honesty. You don't worry. Buy the goods. I will call to sir and be back. Okay. No! Gurbaksh. Ajeet. A police officer was killed in broad daylight. It's a challenge for the police department. I am sure, no matter who the killer is... ...you will arrest him soon. Ajeet, Garewal trusts you a lot. He often gets emotional while talking about you. He considers you his son. We too had a young son. Had he been alive, he would have been like you. But it's not in our control. What had happened to him? I will tell you. It was long time back. There was a time... ...when I was a very greedy officer. As my stature increased... ...my greed also increased. Bungalows, cars... ...land and property... ...I chase those things blindly. But in this blind race... ...God took my son from me. A strange incident transpired. Everyone from the area came to offer condolences. From our area... ...a powerful Jatt... ...Mewa Singh. He used to fight for other's right. He was ahead in every social activity. He met me once. But he left a long lasting impression. When he came to condole. Garewal. You are your son's killer. You have amassed lots of money. What's the use of your land and property? Rich spoil brats, go out at 2 in the night... ...and loiter on the streets. His broken car... ...whose speedometer still reads 140 kmph... ...is still standing on the street. And the people he ran over died on the spot. God made days to work, and nights to sleep. He was naive, but you should have been wiser. What will you do with all this wealth now? His words... ...changed my life. Consider me your son. I will never let you down. I am proud of you, my son. Ajeet has come. He visited last night. Is everything fine? -Son, so early in the morning... -Hello. Is everything fine? -Hello. -Hello. -I wanted to introduce you to my wife. -That's good. Come, dear. Sit. -Hello. -God bless you. Sit. My younger sister is getting married. You are invited. Enjoy the wedding in the village. It's been long since I attend a wedding in the village. We will surely come. I will introduce you to my old friend. Friend? Who? Sardar Mewa Singh. How do you know Mewa Singh? He is my father. That's why you have the same personality, the same way of talking. Apple doesn't fall far from the tree. Didn't I say when I see you I remember someone? I will surely come. But tell me something. It's your sister's wedding. I am your SSP. Why didn't you give me the invitation card yet? Father says during the wedding Friends and relatives are about 50 Rest are crowd You are now a family I appreciate his views. Tell my friend I will be there. I will take my leave. -So soon... -Goodbye. We have to visit some people. Goodbye. -Okay, fine. Goodbye. -Goodbye. Here! -Hello, sir. -Hello, dear. -Hello. -Congrats, dear. -He is my father. -Hello, brother. Mewa Singh. Garewal. -Come. -Please come. Today my son gave me a big gift... ...by introducing me to you. I am very happy. Very happy. Garewal. I have one gift for you too. Come, I will take you to your old SSP. No, Mr. Rai. I am fine here. I never got along with him. I know he is the chief of STF but... -...I am fine here. -I won't meet him. -No. He is STF chief for the public. But he is our friend. I told him that you aren't the same old officer. Come. On one hand SSP is your guest... ...and on the other hand, a nobody like me. Balli. Those who are related by hearts... -...participate in the celebration. -Yes, brother. Status isn't important. Sir, what happened to Paala Singh? Paala is in the jail. No, I am talking about the Paala's ghost. Munshi ,if he is a ghost how can we arrest it? We have to wait to get egg from the hen. And we are trying to get a hen from the egg. Balli, what's the update on the Canadian House? They are some Sandhu family They stay in Chandigarh They rarely visit But the people who stay there... ...say that they have bought the house. They don't visit people around. Very sketchy people pay a visit there. Our DSP and Pana Pradhan... ...go there quite often. Pana Pradhan and DSP. -Yes. -You are laughing here, and your sister is sad there. Come. -You carry on. I will be back. -Okay. -Come. -Let's go. -Balli. -Yes? Sir talked about egg and hen. I felt... ...the wedding will be a dull affair. I think with egg and hen... ...there will be... Only then it will be fun! "You look enticing. Your steps are lightening." "You look enticing. Your steps are lightening." Your adornment woos me. Your adornment woos me. "You and this Jatt make a perfect match." "You and this Jatt make a perfect match." As much as Jatt loves his land... As much as Jatt loves his land... ...I love you equally. You and I make a perfect match. You and I make a perfect match. "When you smile, the heart skips a beat." When you look at me, I get high. "When you smile, the heart skips a beat."

Sir, I was saying that... ...the attack at Pathankot... ...and Gurbaksh's murder... ...and the mystery of Paala's case... ...seem to be linked together. I feel it's a part of a bigger conspiracy. Hmm! -Listen. -Yes? -Mail me all the details and fingerprints. -Okay. -I will talk to DGP and get back to you. -Okay. Your conjecture may be correct. Okay, sir. Thank you. -Please. -Okay, bye. Garewal, it's so odd. You were calling up... ...but you don't know who made you call Mr. Rai. Garewal is very intelligent. He knows everything. -Hmm. -My son has caught the man. Now keep searching. What are you talking about? I can lie to the whole world. You also know, that I can never lie to you. MLA had called up. He said he was an addict He said there will be a problem if we use third degree. That's why I called up. But I don't know why the DSP reached the hospital and on whose behest. Okay. Listen. You leave it to me. -I will do something. -Hmm. Balli, whom are you looking for? Paala. Or Moosa? It took 35 years... ...for Moosa to become Moosa. How many years? 35. And you new kid... ...made schemes in 35 days, to arrest Moosa. I will dig your grave. It will bring death for you. Boys, it's a very big game. Don't interfere. You all will be in trouble. Hello, sir. I wanted to talk to you. Balli didn't return home since last night. And his last location was the Canadian House. Sir, first Zora... ...then Balli. I don't understand what's happening. -Hail India, sir. -Ajeet, you had guessed it right. The second fingerprint is of the international terrorist Moosa. On your information, we have arrested the DSP. But you need to take action before this news comes out. STF team will reach there within 2 hours. I have talked to Garewal as well. First take Paala to the police station, and start the proceedings. You will lead this team. -Okay, sir. -All the best. -Munshi -Sir? Bring Paala to the police station. Okay. Is Paala a man or an illusion? You were yearning to go to hospital. Now I am yearning to know the truth. Tell me clearly. Sir. I never imagined in my wildest dream... ...that the ghost from the Amritsar bus stand... ...will bring such a turmoil in my life. I saw my doppelganger outside the bus. He looked at me. I looked at him. Get aside! Let the passengers pass. When I blinked, he disappeared. After that, I kept wondering for days. Then I felt... ...may it was just a figment of my imagination. Then? One day, I was at my house... ...tying my turban in front of the mirror. How are you, Paala? Who are you? -You. -Me? What do you want? You. I heard people saying... ...that in this world, 7 people have the same face. But you are my soul, Paala. I don't know why... ...I feel as if... ...this is my own house... ...and my mother used to cook food here. And on this bed, my father used to have his meals. Paala. Let me live your life You don't know who I am. After seeing me... ...nobody can live. But you... You are my soul, silly! and souls never die I learnt that Moosa stays at the Canadian House. He often comes to my house, in my guise. He would often tell me... ...Paala, today I met so and so guy in the village. He didn't recognize me. The villagers think I am Paala. Paala, you don't know who I am but... ...you are my soul. Every now and then, he used to come in front of me like a ghost. Then one day there was a din. That day, Moosa came to my house. You have put a recce at my house for Sarvan's murder Moosa was there only. You held his hand. When I saw the police, I went to the Canadian House. Tell me, why did the police arrest our boss? Tell me. I don't know. I feel... Sarvan's ...murder... But... I don't know. Boss doesn't listen to anyone. Listen to me carefully. Go to the police station, and confess to the murder. Understood? It's important that our boss is released. We will get you out later. Okay? Mr. Ajeet. You can proceed the case. Why didn't you tell me in the police station... ...about such a dangerous criminal? Sir, how could I complaint against... ...SHO, DSP and other big officers? Big officials used to visit the Canadian House. I felt they are all hands in glove. Sir. STF team is here. All clear. Stop! Let's go. You let it be. Don't waste bullets. He is as good as dead. Chief, nobody heard your scream. But you surely were scared to death. Get him. -Where is Moosa? -Moosa who? The one whom you met at the police station on DSP's behest. I didn't go to meet any Moosa. I went to meet Paala. After seeing men like you, I am sure... ...even God errs. Take him away. Inspector, leaders and officers of your Punjab... ...for the greed of money and luxury... ...become a pawn of a big conspiracy... ...and they don't even realize it. Where is Balli? Have you made the list? Where is Balli? About whom will you keep asking? Pathankot bomb blast, Zora... ...Gurbaksh... ...or your darling Balli. I bet even the dogs like human flesh. Hey! Balli, I have told you so many times to keep the chain inside. Okay, brother. -Educated boys shouldn't be indulging in show-off. -Okay, brother. Our elders say... ...neither friendship, nor enmity with police is good. But I don't know why I feel like trusting you. Sir. Control your emotions. Balli's sacrifice won't go in waste. Boys of our Punjab are born to be sacrificed for the country. We should do the work for which we are here. Let's find Moosa. He isn't in the house. Mother, police has arrested Paala. Why did you say Paala escaped? When the police raided... ...that scoundrel Paala escaped... ...and hid in the Canadian House. Balli didn't return home since last night. His last location was the Canadian House. Sir, he stays in the Canadian House. He often comes to my house looking like me. Every now and then he would come in front of me like a ghost. Sir, you aren't answering the phone. It's Rinku's phone. It's something important. -Yes, Rinku. -Sir, Moosa's location has changed. -Where is he? -At Paala's house. I am at Paala's house. How far is he from my phone? 7 meters away from you. 7 meters? Oh my God! Such a big guy! I thought a man is standing on top of another. Hey! The story started with bubbles... ...and ended on bubbles. After all, a man is like a bubble of water. Short lived! "The police uniform looks impressive." Red boots have sole of wood.
