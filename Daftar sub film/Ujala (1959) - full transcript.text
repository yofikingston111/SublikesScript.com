There's a trench ahead. Kalu. Why are you working so hard, Ramu? For how long are you going to feed dream bread to those children? I've told you many times, Kalu, don't talk to me. Your talk has no effect on me. No need for effects, Ramu. There's still time left. Throw away this cart and come with me. Kalu! Why are you getting offended, Ramu? Come along with me. Food, clothes, whatever you ask for... That day will never come. Never! Listen to me, Ramu. Else you'll repent one day. That will never happen, Kalu. Never! Swear on God! Talk to me once in a while, Ramu. Hey, Chabili, get down. Why have you become so hot tempered these days? Why don't you talk to me? Look, Chabili, don't try to flatter me, when I am doing business. C'mon, don't imagine yourself to be a businessman. You want to carry loads, do you? Then take me for a ride around the town. Come on. Where do you want to go, Chabili? Take me to the cinema, or show me the theater, show me Ranibaug... or at least show me a glimpse of the goddess Laxmi. You have a glimpse of me today, Chabili. - Have a glimpse of you? - Yes. Look, Ramu, don't you talk like this to me. It makes me blush. Swear on God. And don't you stop me in the middle of the road. If someone passes comments, don't blame me for that. Swear on God, you're so hard hearted. You don't understand any language. Don't you understand the language of the heart? Why are you acting strange? Go away from here. No, I won't go. If I thrash you into the trench, you'll be broken into two pieces. Oh! Swear to God! Oh yes, Ramu. Isn't it Diwali today? What'll you bring for me this evening? A horn costing two paise. You can play it all day long. Such a big festival and such a small gift!? Money is earned with great difficulty, Chabili. For two rupees, I have to slog all day. Understand? You're such a bad man. Munni! Brother! Brother! - Munni! - Brother! Munni! Stop the car. Taxi! Let's go. Chase that car. Move fast! Stop over here. Isn't the life of a poor person valuable, sir? Hey, who are you? I'm the local goon of this neighborhood. In my area, no one can escape after killing someone. Tell me, will justice take place here... or at the police station? Police! C'mon, escape! C'mon, move! Stop! Please come out. Sir, you've caused an accident. You shouldn't flee like this. I ask for forgiveness. Constable, take him to the police station. Get into the car. Oh God! The bleeding isn't stopping. These drivers are merciless. He didn't stop even after seeing the child under the car. Munni! Munni! What are you staring at? Let's take her to the hospital. Nothing can happen here. Come on. Come on. C'mon, dear. Come, mother. Doctor, what's happened to her? Her head has been crushed. She's badly injured. We'll need the senior surgeon. - Senior surgeon? - Yes. She'll need an operation. Nothing to fear. He's on the way. But doctor, will Munni recover? Don't worry, we'll try our best. My Munni will recover. But I'll need money. From where can I get money? Ramu! Don't worry, Ramu. Here, take this money... and save your Munni from the jaws of death. No, Kalu. I don't want your money. I don't want to nurse my sister's wounds with someone's blood. I'll borrow somewhere else. You fool! No one will give you anything for asking. Lala! Lala! Help me! You'll earn the blessings of the poor! Save my, Munni. She's dying in the hospital. Have I signed a contract for your family's welfare? If I help you save Munni today... you'll just come for someone else tomorrow. A poor man, without any thought can produce children... but doesn't know how to produce money. Why are you abusing the child, Lala? It's a God's gift. Some people yearn for a child. Some yearn for money. Have some pity on this poor man and give me some money. I can give you the money... but as soon as you get it you'll disappear. If I go missing, Lala, then assume I haven't tasted my mother's milk. - You want money? Here, take this. - Yes. - Here take this. - You're a very good man, Lala. But listen, Ramu. After Munni's recovery, tell your mother... to marry off Sandhya to me. Lala! Take back your money, Lala. I don't want to sell one sister, to save another one. Let Munni die if she has to. Ramu! Let's go. Munni left us, Ramu. Munni left us. Has Munni left us? C'mon, Munni. Let's go. Ramu, where are you taking my Munni? Don't take away my Munni, Ramu! Burn the corpse. Leave the corpse here and go and buy some wood. Wood? Yes. Ramu, where are you going? Who is it? Here, take the wood. Now at least burn my sister. Now I hope you understand! I used to tell you... no one will give you anything just for asking. Burn this cart. Leave this profession. I'm coming, Kalu! Kalu! I've come, Kalu. Ramu! I knew you'd come to me one day, Ramu. If you had listened to me a few hours ago, your Munni would have been saved. Anyway, it's okay. Now such a death will never again take place in your house, Ramu. From now on, no one will go to bed hungry. Our lives will have no more tears, Ramu. Take this, boss. Ramu, this is Chandu. His fingers can cut better than a pair of scissors. Your innocent looks, his prowess and my mind, and this colony is ours. Ramu, we've another accomplice. His name is Bholu. His brains and fingers both work together. I've brought it, boss. I've brought it. There was a strike in Bombay today. I didn't get any money... - so I brought along this donkey. - Hey, Bolu! Ramu, this is the other accomplice, Bholu. And Bholu, this is our new companion, Ramu. Ramu, here, take ten rupees. Buy grain on your way home to ensure no one goes to bed hungry. Bholu, bring Ramu to our den from tomorrow. Here, I won. Greetings, Kalu boss. Kalu boss, this wasn't aimed at you. The one who saw your selflessness, became yours I became someone's.

Dawn broke, as I thought of this Ramu, Kammo is my life. And Kammo, this is Ramu, my new companion. He looks like a child, Kalu. Come on, smoke the cigarette. Why are you feeling shy? She's your sister-in-law. Take. Take. She's like your sister-in-law? First, you marry me! Then you can bring your brothers to meet me. Kammo, these traits of yours are what I die for. Who's the one who killed me? Come back to your senses, Bholu! Boss, the elders have said, after drinking... you shouldn't regain your senses. Kalu boss! It's not Kalu boss. - It's Kammo. - Hey Kammo! Throw a six! Here it is. Don't go. I'll get more money. Go. Bring the money. Boss, give me ten rupees. I never give money to a loser, Chandu. Chandu, I'm going. - Boss, he's going. - I've told you, no money. Leave the flowers, break the enemy's spine. Poor boy of the streets wants money. Ramu, this is my world. This is where I laugh and this is where I cry. And then I think about this too. To become the Kalu, you've to do all this, Ramu. I'll do, Kalu. I'll definitely do. I understand all that you're saying, Kalu. Till yesterday, I was Ramu. - Today, I'm also Kalu. - Very good, Ramu. Now you've begun to understand the life. Here, take this money as a reward. - 25 rupees? - Yes, now go home. Your mother's waiting. Kalu, you're really a kind-hearted friend. Don't forget Kalu, Ramu. Tripping isn't good for youth, swear on God. Oh no! Teasing travelers isn't good, either, swear on God. Oh, traveler? No clothes, no baggage, no utensils, you're a traveler from which town? Love town. Traveler's from there I've heard, are blind. That's why I tripped. Then how did you fall so gracefully? I had your support. That's why. Look. - Bangle? - Yes. From where did you bring it? I've got a job today. I bought the bangle for ten rupees and here's the balance. Are you happy now? Do you know what giving a bangle means? Yes. Are you trying to teach me? Swear on God, you're a very bad man, Ramu. You capture the heart with only a few words. And you, too, wait for me till midnight? You thought I was waiting for you? I was searching for someone. For whom were you searching? - There's someone. - Okay. What does he look like? - Look like? - Yes. - He resembles you a little. - Really? Fair, very fair. He looks old, but is actually quite young. He's quite faraway, but can be seen quite clearly. His face is quite nice, but who is he? - My cow's calf. - Get lost! Okay. C'mon, today, you have to pay me and then search for your calf. Will your leg ache after searching for a calf? Find the calf first. Only then will you get money. Away from the world, away from envious people Come on, let's go somewhere far away, far away, far away It's a world of love. Everyone's kind-hearted Different is the land, and different is the sky No sign of sin, no saga of sorrow Something that everyone understands, the language of love Away from the world, away from envious people Come on, let's go somewhere faraway, faraway, faraway Hand in hand, without any control Wherever we go, we shall spread light The moon shall say with a grin, holding its heart... there go two lovers Away from the world, away from envious people Come on, let's go somewhere faraway, faraway, faraway Mother! Mother, get up, mother. - What is it? - Get up, mother. Here, take 15 rupees. Fill the house with grain. Now, hunger won't trouble us for a few days at least. But where did you get so much money? Ten rupees this morning? Now 15 rupees!? Mother, my employer is... a very kind-hearted man. His heart was moved upon hearing my plight... and gave me 15 rupees and asked me to pay back my loans. - Really? - Yes. Oh God! Oh God! Oh God! By your grace, this widow day's has changed. Ramu's employer took pity on us poor. Bless him with a long life, God! Bless him with abundance in his earnings! Don't pray for someone, so much, mother. Just pray this much... that Sandhya gets married. Yes, son, if your employer remains unharmed... Sandhya will definitely get married. Now with the grace of God, Ramu has got a permanent job. Now get Sandhya married, soon. You're satisfied with the boy, aren't you? I'm talking to you only after I've approved of him. He earns more than 50 per month. Arrange the marriage today. Within a couple of months the wedding can take place. But sister, we can't afford a dowry. They don't have any expectations of getting anything. All they want is that the family should be decent. Who else would be more decent than us, auntie? Tell me, who has doubted our decency? If I don't go and graze his face, my name isn't Chabili. By God! Which track have you gotten to? I was only talking about Sandhya's alliance. Fine, then talk to me. Who are the people? They live in Banarasidas chawl. And the boy works at a bicycle shop. - Yes, dear. - Then fine. Take us there today. We'll fix it up there, after seeing the boy. And you satisfy them about our decency. That I've already told them... that the girl's brother is decent, beyond the limits. Auntie, this is where you've not spoken the truth. Hey Ramu! - Yes? - Are you really decent? Just look at me once, with your decent gaze! Yes, yes, I am more upright than you. Look mother, ask your wayward one to be quiet. She plays pranks with people, even at two in the morning, on the bridge. Oh, what were you doing at the bridge at two in the morning? I was returning from work. Really? Which office is open till two AM? I want to hear, too. Mother, get Ramu married soon... or else he'll slip out of our hands. By God! As soon as Sandhya gets married, I'll tie you both in holy matrimony. You think I'll marry you? Fatso, have you seen you face in the mirror? Okay mother, I'm leaving now. Listen, come back earlier today. If I see you at the bridge at two AM... I'll shout and awaken the entire colony. Remember this! You're out of your mind! Always yapping! - Shut up! - Cut it out, now. So Ramu? Shall I fix up Sandhya's alliance? Yes, mother. The earlier she marries, the better. Then come, auntie. Let's have a glimpse of the boy and fix... - up the alliance. Come. - Yes, come sister. - Let's go. Greetings, auntie. Come, sister, come. Auntie, he's the boy, isn't he? Yes, that's the boy. Then what was there to see in him? I've seen him at the bicycle shop a dozen times. Why? Haven't you liked the boy? Oh, why wouldn't I like him? Sharp nose, jet black eyes... and the face is such, it enters the heart at the very first glimpse. Mother... she... she... Hey, why do you get nervous, my sweetheart! I haven't come to marry you. I'm the elder sister of the girl. Elder sister. - Will do. - What? Keep quiet now. Sit. We accept the alliance, sister. If you accept it, then send the engagement bangles in a couple of days. - Is that okay, Lallu's mother? - Yes. Look sister, we don't expect a dowry. One gets everything, upon getting a good family. Oh, our second name is decency. And then the girl's brother is an angel. An angel! Don't let my face mislead you, friends I have a heart, too. Don't be scared of me Don't let my face mislead you, friends I have a heart, too. Just don't avoid me Don't let my face mislead you, friends I'm a king at heart For my love, I'd sacrifice everything I'm a poor man. That's my only misfortune I have yet to be introduced to her Don't let my face mislead you, friends I have a heart, too. Don't be scared of me Don't let my face mislead you, friends Long live your wealth! Hail to your pockets! I will speak the truth, by God! Death be to this stomach which condemns us to sin Don't let my face mislead you, friends I have a heart, too. Don't be scared of me Don't let my face mislead you, friends What kind of world is this? Life is difficult; death is easy We're still living while licking our wounds Our state is all thanks to people like you Don't let my face mislead you, friends I have a heart, too. Don't be scared of me Don't let my face mislead you, friends Catch him! He took my money! He took my money! Catch him! He took my purse! My 20 rupees! Someone catch him. Someone catch him! Got him! Don't let him escape! Catch him! Don't let him escape! Catch him! Catch him! I won't spare you. Where will you escape today? Catch him. Caught him! Where will you go now? - Oh, slipped out of my hands. - Why is she after me? Run slowly, you wicked fellow! - I'm dead. - Walk slowly. Oh God, I'm so tired of running. Where will you go? - Now I won't let you go. - Let go of me. Escaped again! Catch him! Stop, stop! Yes, stop. Stop. Greetings! Just stop! Hurry up! Behind that car. Greetings! Greetings! Thanks!

Your wedding is arranged. - Brought it for me? - Yes. This chain's from where? This is my stuff. I brought it for her. When did you begin cheating Kalu? Why didn't it come to me directly? Must everything come to you? You, too, give many things to your Kammo. Boss, boss, a pick pocket from our turf has come to your turf. How much? I saw him taking change of a 1000 rupee note. - Where's he gone? - To the movies. It's ending now. Ramu, Bholu, Chandu! Chandu! Taxi! Boss, he's the one. Victoria! Bholu. Victoria! Move. Taxi! Taxi! Ramu. Chandu. Taxi! Catch him. Ramu, Kalu's been caught. Move aside. You're working with a great company. Now your life will be made. - Shut up, Chabili. - A grown up sister... a hungry mother and the son a thief? Okay Ramu, continue with this trade. You'll earn a real good name for yourself. - Chabili. - And your sister's wedding will definitely take place. Her in-laws will sing your praises. I told them, right? That the girl's brother is an angel. Listen to me, Chabili. Now, there will be a pile of gold and silver in your house. And the community people will worship at your feet. They won't worship. Rather they'll lick my soles! Then go to your Kalu, rot in the jail... ruin your parent's honor and hand over your sister to some ruffian. Chabili... I'm not doing this work for my personal gain, Chabili. I just want Sandhya to get married... and that family members all get two square meals a day, Chabili. You're committing a sin, Ramu. It's a sinful business. Why don't you understand? There's no blessing of abundance, in its earnings. It's a sinful business. Walk away, Ramu. You should have told me. I would have gotten you a job somewhere else. Leave this work, Ramu. Please leave it. Leave Kalu's company. These earnings carry no blessings. It's a sinful work. It's a sinful work. Mother, Lala has come. Yes, coming, daughter. - Greetings, auntie. - Greetings Lala. Tell me, what's the matter? Your seven month's rent is due. Pay 14 rupees right away otherwise... Why are you getting angry, Lala? It's just a matter of 14 rupees, right? I'll get it from Ramu. Ramu, wake up. Get up, Ramu. What's the matter, mother? Wake up. That Lala has come. Wake up and give me some money, if you have. Mother, I didn't bring any money home last night. Then what should I tell Lala? When will you be able to get some money? Mother, my employer has left town. I can't do anything until he returns.. He'll be back in a few days, right? I think so, mother. But he might take longer. What's happening, auntie. How long will I have to wait at your door? Just wait for a few more days. I will pay your each and every penny. You'll have to pay the rent today... or else I'll throw all your belongings outside. No, Lala. Have mercy on us poor. It's monsoon time. Where can I go with small children and a grown up daughter? You seem to have turned blind away from your grown up daughter. If you wish, you can get her married this very day. We worry a lot about about this. Why worry when Banwari Lala is here? Lala! Get lost from here. Collect your money tomorrow morning. If I don't get my money tomorrow, I'll... Get out of here! From where will you get so much money in one day? Your employer isn't here. Mother, Lala will get his money tomorrow. Son, don't do anything bad out of worry. God never forgives one who sins. Trust me, I won't do anything bad. I won't. Please send two special teas to Chandu's shop. Take, two special teas. I need 14 rupees. I'll wash dishes, do anything. I need 14 rupees. Sir... - I need 14 rupees, listen to me. - What are you doing? Have you lost your mind? If I don't get 14 rupees by night, I'll surely lose my mind. Go, get lost. Sir, listen to me, sir. I've been roaming since morning. No one even cared to listen to me. God has given you everything, sir. I just need 14 rupees. I'll do anything for you. I'll wipe you car. I'll polish your shoes. I'll wash your clothes, sir. - Sir, I just want 14 rupees. - Get lost, you beggar! Sir? No one will give anything, if you ask them. Truth holds no value in this world. Son, don't do anything bad out of worry. God never forgives one who sins. Trust me, I won't do anything bad. I won't. - Ramu. - Bholu? Come, Kalu is calling. Kalu's back from jail? You thought he'd be inside for the rest his life? Come. No Bholu, I can't go with you today. I need 14 rupees by tomorrow morning. Come, I'll get them from Kalu. No Bholu, I don't need Kalu's earnings today. I promised mother I wouldn't do anything evil today. With you... Four rupees. I still need ten more rupees. Chandu? Forget Chandu, boss. He won't come now. Where will he escape? You didn't do it right, boss. You slapped him in front of all. He informed on us to the police. We were working with such honor! Everything has gone awry. Kalu. Ramu. I have come again today, Kalu. Today, I can do anything that you want. Tonight will be my last night of crime, Kalu. Today, I'm ready to bet my life on whatever you want me to bet it. Tonight, all I want is just one 10 rupee bill. Only 10 rupees. All you need is just one 10 rupee bill, tonight. It's a deal. Come with me. Boss? Bholu, you sit here. I'll be back. Ramu, I'll wait for you at the mouth of the narrow lane. You'll have to bring Chandu along. After we finish, a 10-rupee note will be yours. Let's go. Kalu, Chandu has come. I ask you, Chandu. Who informed the police yesterday? I did. Chandu, how dare you do that? Chandu, I don't want to kill my companions. You fool! I know! - Me? - Yes, Ramu, you. Kalu! Chandu has died! Chandu has died! Chandu has died! Ramu, run away! Chandu has died! Ramu, run! You committed this murder, Ramu. You! This murder will be on your head. You went to call him. People must've seen you with him. - Me? - Yes, Ramu, you. The law will hold you as the murderer. It's you who'll be hanged. You! Ramu, look. Stop the work. If you want to save your life... disappear from here for awhile. And tape your mouth. Go, run away, Ramu. Run away. Run away. Bholu, tell me, promise me, Bholu... that you won't share this secret with anyone. Tell me, Bholu, that you'll say nothing. - No. - Okay. Bholu won't tell it to anyone. Police? No, no. Why have you come here? Where is Ramu? Ramu? Why? What do you have to do with my Ramu? He's a murderer. He killed Chandu in the narrow lane. Murder? My Ramu? No. no. My Ramu can't be a killer. He's a murderer! We've come to arrest him. Mother. I haven't done anything, mother. I haven't done anything. - Ramu. - I haven't done anything, mother. What happened? What has happened to you? Ramu, what has happened, my son? Nothing, just getting scared, mother. Scared? Scared of what? - Mother. - What happened, son? I'm very scared, today, mother. Hey, you nitwit! You are scared despite being so grown up? Yes, mother. Son. What fear do you have when your mother is with you? Sleep. Ramu's mother, it's morning. Wait Lala. Let me wake up Ramu. I'll give your money just now. Ramu! Ramu! Son wake up, that Lala has come. Give him his money. - That Lala has come. - Lala? You've started to freshen up. That Lala is standing there. What a phenomenon this money is, mother! Forget man, even God would go mad, if fallen in its trap. You've brought the money, haven't you? Must have been the biggest enemy of mankind... the one who created money on this earth. Had this money not been there, I wouldn't have begged on the streets... wouldn't have carried their loads. And neither would have I gone to Kalu. Only for ten rupees, mother, just for ten rupees. But that deal proved to be very expensive. That deal... Deal? What deal are you talking about? You don't know, mother. In that deal, a human life... was like, like... Like? - Like... - Then? - Then... - Then, what happened? - Then, mother... - Then, what happened? Mother. Where did you go? You loafer, ruffian, liar. You went, but you left this blemish with me. When I kept lying to you... you believed me, mother. Today, I told you the truth... and you thought it a fantasy? Fine, mother. Enough of your dramas, Ramu's mother. Give me my money or else I'll throw your belongings out. Take this, Lala. Your rent. Thank you, auntie. Perhaps God wished this only that... the last memory of my husband doesn't remain with me till my end. Chabili, you were talking about some job that day, right? Which job? Go, Kalu must be waiting for you. I take an oath on you, I have left Kalu's company. Get me any job. Really. Really, Ramu? - You've left Kalu's company? - Yes, Chabili. Now you've come to your senses. By God! Come with me. Give it. Come with me. Uncle! By God! Even the moustache in the old age is very sharp. For whom are you making these knives? Hey, how come you've lost your way, today? Oh, I've come all this way to see you, uncle. At least look at me and talk. Tell me, what do you want to say? Understand for what I've come to say, without me saying anything. Will you speak? Just look at this boy. Even if an elephant stands on his arm, it won't bend. By God! He can do the work of four men, at least. Hire him for a job with you. - Is he trustworthy? - Yes, yes, I'll vouch for him. If you want, put my thumb impression on a blank paper. C'mon Ramu, start working immediately. Nothing to worry about, uncle. If you suffer any loss, catch hold of Chabili. Work properly, Ramu. I have given your guarantee. Don't worry, Chabili. Hey, why will Chabili worry? Okay Ramu, I'll go now. Okay? Okay. Uncle, I'm leaving. Listen... what's your name? - Ramu. - Listen, Ramu... my shop has very expensive knives. My own and also those of customers. Everyone here is a trusted person. You, too, work with honesty. Honesty and trust are the only possessions of a poor man, sir. A poor person might die but never bargain on this possession. - Trust me. - Great! - Thakur! - Coming, sir. This isn't difficult work. You'll learn it quickly. And then the more you work, the more money you'll earn. One anna for putting a blade on four knives. Thakur, teach him to operate the machine. Come. Bholu, it's been fifteen days and Ramu hasn't turned up. He'll show up only if he's in this world. - I hope he wasn't caught. - Possible. He was a decent chap, though. Where to look for him now? I'm afraid, Bholu, he might fall into the hands of the police. - It will be good. - It will be good? - What do you mean, Bholu? - He'll at least get the jail food. Jail food? It's easy to say that, you idiot. Ask those who had to eat their food. One has to break rocks there, too. And I'm afraid, if Ramu is required to break rocks... even for a single day, he'll reveal everything to the police. Come, inspector. Tell me, how can I help you? Who is Chandu the knife-seller? I'm the one, tell me. Do you recognize this knife? Someone was killed with this knife in the narrow-street. What happened, Ramu? Nothing, sir. The belt snapped. Thakur, change the machine belt. This knife was produced in your shop, wasn't it? - Yes. - And this is your trademark, right? Yes. Can you tell me who bought this knife? This is very difficult to tell, inspector. Hundreds of knives are made and sold here every day. - How many workers work with you? - Must be around eight to ten. But inspector, all of them are very old. - Can you show me a similar knife? - Fine. - Bring the knife that you have, Ramu. - What? Yes, the same one. Excuse me. So all your men are old, right? Yes, inspector, but he began work just today So dear. What's your name? - Ramu. - Ramu? Which work were you doing previously? - I used to drive a cart. - Why did you stop? I wasn't earning enough to survive. Not making enough? - The belt has been put on, sir. - The belt's replaced. I'll go now. Wait. Yes? Where do you live? Parel. Chawl number nine. Chawl number nine? - The chawl behind the narrow street? - What? Isn't it? Yes. What do you know about Chandu's murder? Nothing. - No one ever told you anything? - No. - Never heard anything from anyone? - No. Have you ever seen this knife? - No. - Look at it. - No. - Never? - Never. - Okay. Okay sir, if the need arises... you'll be called to the police station. - Thanks. - Very well. Ramu, these cops are such strange people. They were asking me as if... I was the murderer's friend... or as if I've hidden the killer in my shop. - What? - Nothing, Ramu... go and do your work. Go. Go. Mother. What are you thinking? What's there to think, daughter? If the silver bangles don't reach Sandhya's in-laws' place by tomorrow... the engagement won't be confirmed. Why do you worry, mother? Everything will be all right. How will everything turn out alright? Ramu just recently started his job. How will we get so much money? Didn't I already say everything will be all right? You don't understand, dear. If the arrangements aren't made, the engagement will break. The engagement won't break, mother. Why do you worry? I'll set everything all right. I'm telling you. I'll set everything straight. I'll set it right. God, God! Goodness! Interest is forbidden for me. I donate all this money to the charity at the cowshed. And from you, I have charged only two percent on this cow. Yes, yes, Lala... you're the only virtuous soul left in the neighborhood. By God! So you already know it, don't you? Not only do I know... I was thinking that the day Banwarilal passes away... even the mourners will have to be borrowed... from the cowshed on interest. By God! Oh my goodness! What are you saying? Lala, give me the money. - One, two... - Why are you counting? Give it to me. And my cow is tied here. After one month, I'll take her by repaying the principle with interest. And if I find a difference of a single gram in this cow, I will... You know Chabili very well. By God! I knew a little. The rest I've learned today. Mother! Sandhya! Gangu? - What's the matter, Ramu? - Auntie! - Is everyone at your place? - No son, they have... - Everything all right, auntie? - Yes, Ramu. They've all gone to Mangal sir's bungalow. For what? To satiate their hunger. Mother! Mother! Did you already assume I died, mother? Why are you cleaning others dishes when I am still alive!? Sandhya, you fool, these hands are meant to apply myrtle. Mad girl, c'mon, wash your hands. Gangu, Ganga Ram, you're working? Here, take this, eat. Take this Bansi. Have some, Lallu. Everyone's working. Hey, your Ramu brother is still alive. Why do you need to work? Take this, mother, you eat too. As long as my body can work... I won't let you do this work, mother. For us, hunger doesn't mean anything, son. We're used to living on an empty stomach. But a poor person gets compelled for the dignity, at times. You don't know, son. Only when a poor person's girl is wedded is she known to have nuptials. If she's at home... - she's called a widow, son. - Mother. Mother, don't kill your Ramu while he's still alive. - Trust me, mother. - Son. Have faith in me, mother. All your hopes will be realized. Trust me, mother. Sandhya's bangles, her marriage... everything will be done. Just trust me, mother. - Yes, son. - Come, mother. Come with me. Come with me. Come Sandhya. Gangu, come dear. Lallu, come. Get up, Bansi. Come, mother. No need to work now. Mother, trust me. Sandhya's engagement will never break. You'll get her bangles tomorrow. Most definitely. Okay mother, I'll leave now. I have to work overnight. Okay? Okay, son. If you have to work overnight, why don't you rest for awhile? Enough of the rest. Now, unless I work day and night things won't work. Hey, why do you boss around unnecessarily? You don't even have time to talk? The way you're behaving with me today... I, too, will do the same with you tomorrow. You've shown that today, Chabili. Mother and Sandhya go and wash dishes at Mangal sir's... and you just loaf around carelessly? I've seen you too, Chabili. Everything's just for show. Now I need no one's help. I'll do everything on my own, understood? Take these, mother. Tomorrow, give these bangles to Sandhya's in laws... and fix the engagement. Chabili, you seem to be related to me from some previous birth! Am I not related to you in this birth, mother? Ramu, Ramu. Ramu. Sorry, I dozed off, sir. Were you working all night? If I don't work, how will things work out? The milk lady was right. That you are a trustworthy man. Sir, tell me, how much should I work... that after 25 days I can earn 100 rupees? After 25 days! That means on 5th August? It's my sister's engagement on that day, sir. - Your sister's engagement? - Yes, sir. You'll get it. And if you keep working so hard... it might be more than 100 rupees. - And if it doesn't? - You'll still get it, Ramu. I'm very happy with your hard work and honesty. - Ramu brother... - Mother! - Ramu! - Come mother. Sir will give me 100 rupees on 5th of August. No more worries. Sandhya's engagement will definitely happen on the 5th of August. - Oh Ramu! - Sir, she's my mother. - Sir, she is my mother. - Is he your younger brother, Ramu? - Yes, sir. - So Gangu, greet sir. - Greetings! - Nice kid. Sir, by giving Ramu a job... you have removed all our worries. Your son is very industrious and honest, sister. May God bless everyone with such a child! Ramu, invite your sir to... attend Sandhya's engagement and wedding for sure. Tell me, sir, will you come? Your attendance will bring glory to us poor. Yes, yes, I will come, definitely. Ramu, bring your sir along with you, on that day. Yes, mother. Sir, I'll be back in a moment. - Come, mother. - Come, son. Mother, you've brought food for me? Right? Yes, son. You came hungry in the night. The entire night, I kept dreaming about you. I don't know how you can work... without any food or water. Mother! Have this, son. - Have this, son. Take. - Mother, I'll feed myself. You moron, do you feel embarrassed eating... from the hands of your mother? Have it. You've brought food for me at such an old age, mother! Why didn't you send that no-good Chabili, instead? She's angry with you. You scolded her last night, right? If I shouldn't scold, should I have put her on my head? You don't know how she managed to buy the bangles for Sandhya's engagement. And there you were, you fought with her! - Bangles? - Yes. See these. Upon giving these bangles, Sandhya's engagement will be fixed. Mother, that no-good Chabili gave you these? Hey Ramu, where are you going? - Finish your food and then go. - Coming, mother. Coming. Swaying weather! Beautiful season! A damsel, fair like the moon Kohl (kajal) in the eyes, perspiration on her face Goodness! She took my heart away Some admirer has entered my dreams Won me over in a single glimpse... by spelling a cast of love over me Goodness! He took my heart away On chilling streets, under the bushes The arrows of the gaze were shot galore You, too, were wounded there and so was I wounded here Wearing a red drape and with a unique gait Ornaments on the forehead and ears With pearl studded bangles in her wrists Goodness! She took my heart away Some admirer has entered my dreams... won me over in a single glimpse... by spelling a cast of love over me Goodness! He took my heart away You are here and I am here as well Where will such a union happen? I swear upon you, my sweetheart My heart resides where you are The owner of my heart is a crazy fellow Unique in this whole world Sun of love, brightness of the day Goodness! He took my heart away Swaying weather! Beautiful season! A damsel, fair like the moon Kohl (kajal) in the eyes, perspiration on her face Goodness! She took my heart away A fire was ignited on both sides Such was it that it couldn't be extinguished You got burned in it and so did I But still the flower of the heart blossomed God! You face is like the tale of the flower Your tresses are like a lovely dusk Queen of beauty and love Goodness! She took my heart away Some admirer, having entered my dreams... won me over in a single glimpse... by casting a spell of love over me Goodness! He took my heart away Swaying weather! Beautiful season! A damsel, fair like the moon Kohl (kajal) in the eyes, perspiration on her face Goodness! She took my heart away Ramu it's your sister's engagement today, isn't it? - Yes, sir. - Do you want the 100 rupees now or later? I'll take it this afternoon when I leave. Very well. Also, Ramu... don't leave the shop unattended. I'll be back later. Only then go for your lunch. Okay, sir. So, Knifeman! Put a blade on these scissors. No. How much money will you take? - Not a single penny. - Why not? I beg of you, Kalu, go away from here. Please go. Ramu. Kalu won't go alone, today. Today, you have to go alone, Kalu. Our friendship was over that night... That night? What happened that night, Ramu? Why don't you speak? Why have you gone mum? Nothing, Kalu. Let me eat honest bread, Kalu. I want to live in peace. You fool, your honesty ended the day... you burned your handcart. And peace? Peace you lost the day... you went to call Chandu. I'll go mad, Kalu. For God's sake, go away. Try to understand what I want to say, Ramu. No, Kalu. No. Ramu, don't embrace this machine. It'll kill you prematurely, one day. Let it kill me! But Ramu won't go with you. Won't go! Won't go! Won't go! Forget it, boss. Let him stay here. Why are you crying, Ramu? Offer me a cup of tea, at least. Then Kalu will go. - Tea? You want tea? - One cup. - I'll bring it right away. Right now. - Fine, Ramu. Boss! Now Ramu will definitely come to Kalu. - Hats off to you, boss! - Tea! Tea. Okay dear, I'm going now. But Ramu... whenever you get tired of this machine... come directly to Kalu. His door is open, forever. Bholu. Come. Don't be shy of your old friends, Ramu. What are you thinking? - Nothing. - You should remain happy. Go and have your lunch. And upon returning, take 100 rupees for your sister's engagement. - Okay? - Yes, sir. - Go. - Greeting! - Bring water also. Pay before leaving. Give him snacks. Come on, tell me. Bring a plate of snacks. - Your turn. - Yes you start. Come, inspector. Please sit. You have murdered Chandu. You killed him. You went to call him. Chandu was last seen with you. Thus, in the eyes of the law you're the murderer. You, you're the murderer! Ramu is not that kind of man, inspector. But where has he gone? A poor person is compelled for his dignity, at times. You don't know, son. A poor person's daughter, when she's married... is considered having nuptials. If she's at home... - she's known as a widow. - Mother! Have faith in me, mother. Bangles for Sandhya... her engagement, her marriage, all will happen definitely. Will Ramu come now? He'll surely come, inspector. And today he can't go anywhere. Today is his sister's engagement... and how can he go without taking money from me? Just relax and sit here. He'll show up. Ramu has come, mother. My son has such a long life! We were just talking about you. C'mon give the money to Chabili, soon, so that she can go to the market. C'mon Ramu, take out the money. Chabili, tell me something. Chabili, those who don't have money for two square meals... isn't nuptial music played at their house, Chabili? What are you talking about, Ramu? - C'mon, take out the money. - Haven't you left yet, Chabili? I can't go until he loosens the purse strings. - Ramu, give it to her, soon. - Mother, I want to ask you something. - Now, first give her the money... - Mother, I'm asking you something. Mother, tell me, those who starve for food... don't their girls ever wear wedding attire? What has happened to you? What are you talking about today? Must a poor man's daughter remain unmarried, mother? Do they get married? Ramu!? Mother... Just consider, consider, that I wasn't born, mother. Consider that something bad happened to me today. - Won't Sandhya's marriage... - Ramu! What nonsense are you talking? Look Ramu, it's your sister's engagement today. No more stories like that. No, no. Mother, I'm not narrating a fantasy. Mother, trust me. Chabili, convince mother I'm telling the truth. Ramu! - Ramu! - Ramu! - Ramu! - Come away from there. Ramu! Where has Ramu gone? - Ramu! - What happened to Ramu? - Look there. Ramu is running away. - Running away? Ramu! Where shall we go now? Tell this to us, Earth! There is no one in this world to call our own People are scared of their own shadows No one trusts anyone, any longer Where shall we go now? We go door to door and show our hearts But the people of this world scorn us The paths are missing The destinations are lost No one trusts anyone, any longer Where shall we go now? Eyes are filled with hatred and savagery What is this poison which has contaminated the world's atmosphere? The hamlets of love have started to turn into ashes No one trusts anyone, any longer Where shall we go now? Each breath is earned Each life is like a pearl But they hold no value in the market Life has no value in this world! No one trusts anyone, any longer Where shall we go now? Tell this to us, Earth There is no one in this world to call our own Where shall we go now? What do you want, son? What can I wish for? All the roads of my life are closed now. Who has closed all the roads of your life? Some by my near and dear ones and some by outsiders. Who were those near and dear ones? One of them is my mother, who gave birth to me... but never tried to understand me... and never trusted me. I always wanted to be truthful to her... but she mistook my truth to be some false story. The other one is my childhood friend... who exploited me and made me a thief, thug and a pickpocket. You forgot this son... that nobody on this earth is a thief, thug or pickpocket. - How so? - It's the difficult circumstances in life... in which a person gets trapped and loses his virtue. His soul gets tired and his faith is destroyed. Then what should I think myself to be? Innocent. Ramu! - Ramu! - Mother! - Ramu! - Mother! Mother! I'm innocent. I didn't do anything. Then why did you run away from the shop and house? Chabili! Convince mother. I didn't do anything. I swear. Every thief swears his innocence. Thief? What was stolen? They say you stole a silver knife from the shop. Knife? No Chabili! No mother! It's wrong. It's absolutely wrong, mother. Ignoring such a huge amount, why would I steal a silver knife? And those hundred rupees weren't for some charity... - but payment for my work. - If you didn't steal... why run away without taking your money? Your sister's engagement was that evening, wasn't it? Ramu! C'mon, speak up. Ramu, why don't you speak? You haven't committed any murder, that you might be hanged. Speak up, Ramu. Now's not the time to remain silent. Your silence shouldn't cause... your sister's engagement to be broken. Speak up. You son was very sincere. But don't know what went wrong with him today, all of a sudden. Always something goes wrong with him, just recently. Acharyaji! Acharyaji! I didn't do anything. At least you believe me, Acharyaji. Mister! Did you report the matter to the police? Not yet. If you receive the price of that knife, will you leave him? - I'm the owner of that knife. - I ordered that knife from the shop. Who'll pay the price? How much does it cost? Sixty rupees. Here, take this. And pay his labor to sister. - Very well. - Thank you. Come, inspector. You preserved my dignity. I'd have been shamed if I hadn't gotten the money... for my daughter's engagement. Sister, don't feel bad. You definitely gave birth to him... but you've never tried to understand him. Don't make the same mistake again... or else, all your children will turn into a Ramu. Go sister. From today he'll stay in this Ashram. But... But it's her sister's wedding on 25th August. Don't worry about anything. Your daughter will definitely get married. And I'll personally bring him with me that day. Okay, son. Fine. Munni's mother-in-law has come! - Munni's mother-in-law has come! - I see. I thought your mother-in-law had come. My mother-in-law is dead! - Oh, your mother-in-law is dead? - Dead. Come, I'll get you a new mother-in-law, come. Come. Oh, hey you milk woman... have you quit the milk-selling business? Get lost! Go and wash people's dirt. I clean people's filth... but I don't go door to door like you, selling milk worth pennies. Get lost! Or else I'll throw you in the water along with your donkey! By God! - Don't you dare touch my donkey! - Fatty auntie, what do you do? Fatty auntie, what do you do? Fatty auntie, what do you do? By God! I let go of them. Otherwise you'd have squeezed them like wet clothes! Come on. Have, eat, dear. Eat. Many congratulations, Lallu's mother. By accepting my daughter, you've preserved my dignity. It's all right, sister. But where is her brother? By God! Her brother can't spare any time from work to come home. Do you have business with him? No, I just asked casually. Yes, it's fine. She's very mischievous. Hey, Sandhya! Don't eat all the sweets yourself. I, too, own a share in it. By God! You can have it all, sister. By God! You just arrived and now you're going again? I'll be back soon. Ramu! Hey, Ramu! Hey, you son of Ramu! Ramu! Oh! You and here? Come. Come downstairs. Come. Go away. Go away from here. This is an Ashram. I don't know any Ashram. I just want you to come downstairs. Come. Someone might see. Go away. Go away. You won't come? This damn Chabili, would've gotten me in trouble. She came to the Ashram. If Acharyaji learns, what then? Hey, Ramu! Will you open the window or not? Open it. Had you not opened the window... then I would've smashed the glass. By God! Why did you come here? I felt like coming here, so I came. Who are you to ask me? Females aren't permitted to come here. C'mon. Can't you see the difference between another woman and me? Now that you've come, tell me why you're here? My dear, what business can I have? I've come to feed you these sweets. Eat these to celebrate your sister's engagement. C'mon, have it. Eat it. Eat it. Hey Chabili... you must be gloating while feeding me this, right? And you must be thinking... when these days are over... you'll dress up in the clothes of a bridegroom. And you? Hidden by a veil... sitting quietly in the palanquin... - you'll watch me on the sly, right? - What are you saying, Ramu? I feel shy. By God! You are always feeling shy. By the way, how are my mother and Sandhya? Yes, Gangu, Mangu, Hira, Moti, Jyoti, everyone is fine. Ask me also, how I am. What's to ask about you? You're standing here, in front of me, hail and hearty. By God! You are stonehearted, Ramu. You don't understand any language. Not even the language of the heart. - Hey, someone's come. Leave now! - Let him come. - Eat the sweets... - You leave, go please. - Let me go. - Go away. Okay, I'm going. Just as a favor to you. - Go. Hurry up. - I'm going! - Go. Go. - I'm going, but let go of me first. Go. Hurry up. This is an Ashram, Ramu. - An Ashram. - Yes. Mother. Sandhya, you're being coy! Changu, Mangu, Gangu... Give. Listen to the tinkling Oh dear, listen to the tinkling The night struts. So do the rows of stars We also move along with them Listen to the tinkling Wow! Dance to the tinkling With a vigorous thumping on the percussion of life... this song of happiness is emanating Night blossoms, so does love. Merrily swinging spring blossoms as well Each step is turning into a dance Listen to the tinkling Oh dear, listen to the tinkling The night struts. So do the rows of stars We also move along with them Listen to the tinkling Wow! Dance to the tinkling Hail to the tinkling Each desire of the heart is like a burning ember Each gaze seems to give out the secret of the heart When the eyes met, things started moving of their own accord Now who can ask anyone to stop? Listen to the tinkling Wow! Dance to the tinkling The night struts. So do the rows of stars We also move along with them Listen to the tinkling This festival of smiles All my wishes have been fulfilled Let this sequence of happiness continue! May no sorrow ever come in this direction Listen to the tinkling The night struts! So do the rows of stars We also move along with them Listen to the tinkling Wow! Dance to the tinkling The night struts! So do the rows of stars We also move along with them Listen to the tinkling Hail to the tinkling Wow! Dance to the tinkling From where are you coming, so late in the night? Manager sir, you know that... my sister's wedding is approaching. Look, this is the second time. If you try to break the Ashram's rules again... I'll have to take strict action. Understood? All the Ashram mates are dear to me, like my own children. Today, a father is giving all this to his daughter on her wedding. Acharyaji, today it feels to me... that my father hasn't died. He's still alive. Ramu, I assure you... you hard work will never go in vain. Go Ramu, finish your work quickly. In the evening, all the Ashram mates will attend your sister's wedding. Go Ramu. Acharyaji, did you call me? Yes. Put Ramu in charge of the Ashram's purchases from today. Can Ramu be trusted in matters of money? Why not? Call Ramu. Look Ramu, you have new responsibilities from today. Take this money and this is the list. Pick up the bags from there. And buy all these things. And listen, Acharyaji had previously... never trusted anyone in matters of money, so soon. His trust should not be misplaced. Work with honesty. Trust me, Mr. Manager. This money is the Ashram's responsibility on me. I'll never violate Acharyaji's trust. Trust me. Munni! Munni! Stop! Munni! What happened? Munni! Munni! Munni! Munni! My daughter! My daughter! Thanks a lot. How can I repay you? I didn't save your Munni, for personal gain. A hundred? Two hundred? A thousand? Two thousand? Take whatever you wish from this. No sir, it's your money. You keep it. He's not a man, he's an angel! An angel. I've come from Acharyaji. Please give the Ashram goods. Fine. My money! My money? What happened? Forgot the money? No, I didn't forget. I'll be back in a moment. I'll be back in a moment. Ramu, where are the Ashram goods? What am I asking? Where are the goods? My, my money, is lost. I already knew that. I expect... you'll make up some story. No, I'm not making anything up. Trust me. When I went to buy the goods... I don't want to hear anything you have to say. Whatever you have to say, say it in front of Acharyaji. I beg of you, Mr. Manager... please don't take me to Acharyaji. That's impossible. I've already forgiven you twice, before this. But this relates to money. I'm helpless. Come with me. I warned you earlier... not to trust him to handle money. - But you... - Mr. Manager. What happened, Ramu? I'm telling the truth, Acharyaji. While saving a girl's life in the market... the purse fell out of my pocket. Trust me, Acharyaji. It's no lie. But earlier, he broke the Ashram's rules twice. Once some girl came to meet him in the Ashram. I pardoned him. The second time he was missing from the Ashram, and after midnight. I pardoned him then, too. But why couldn't you pardon him this time? Just because it's related to money. Right? Yes. Keshav, it's of the utmost importance that you trust this boy... or else even this Ashram will become his house for him. I'll prove to you that Ramu is an honest boy. Take this, Ramu. One hundred rupees. And get all those things for the Ashram, soon. Acharyaji, you still trust me? Trust, trust can never die, Acharyaji. A man can't live without trust. This isn' money, this is my life. Now prove to the Manager that you're still worthy of being trusted. So I can continue helping thousands... of other Ramus throughout my life. Acharyaji, nothing but death can stop me now. I'll return soon. Keshav, Ramu will come. He'll surely come. Sir, take this hundred rupees and please... I knew it, that you'd run away from the Ashram with the money. Kalu... today I won't let you take this money, Kalu. This money is my life. - Your life? - Listen to me Kalu. Kalu, you don't know that represents Acharyaji's faith in me. I would be ruined. I would be destroyed. - Give the money back. - Ramu, let me go! Kalu! Kalu! My naive beloved doesn't know the secrets of my heart! Doesn't know. Doesn't even listen My naive beloved doesn't know the secrets of my heart! Just the way the branch bent burdened with flowers... still the gardener didn't understand He made this little life suffer with pain All men are really bad My naive beloved doesn't know the secrets of my heart! Doesn't know. Doesn't even listen My naive beloved doesn't know the secrets of my heart! I tied the thread of love But still the fortunes didn't smile on my heart I still haven't received a response to my love I thought he would come to marry me My naive beloved doesn't know the secrets of my heart! Doesn't know. Doesn't even listen My naive beloved doesn't know the secrets of my heart! Kalu! No Kalu. Not today. - What? - Give the money back to me. It's not just a hundred-rupee note but an angel's trust in me. Mad. It's not a matter of money, but my life. This money isn't supposed to be given to a dancer. - Get lost, Ramu! - This Ramu no longer dances to your tune. I'll go only after taking my money back. C'mon, give it to me. Kalu boss, escape from here. The police are raiding this place. Police! Run! The police have arrived. Look over there. Don't move or else I'll shoot! Halt! Where did he escape? Where is that Kalu rogue? I'm asking, where is that Kalu rogue? Constables, take them in. - Acharya sir, Ramu hasn't come? - Ramu? You promised to bring him along with you today. I had thought so, sister. But I had... - Did you send him out on some business? - Yes. But... - But why is he late in arriving? - Don't worry, sister. He'll come. Please call the bride's brother for performing the rites. - To perform the rites? - Amazing! At his sister's wedding the brother is missing. Such a careless person? Brother himself is missing. He can't even get to his sister's wedding on time. Did he forget, or something? This is something new. The one who was to perform the rituals is missing. So Acharya sir, have you seen the consequences of trusting Ramu? You're mistaken, Mr. Manager. I'm sure Ramu will come, most certainly. I'm sure, too, Acharyaji, but of his not coming. The auspicious time is passing by. Hurry up. Don't get anxious. Ramu must be coming any moment now. If the girl's brother doesn't come, who will complete the rituals? I'll complete the rituals. I will. Tell me, where is Kalu? Who is Chandu's murderer? - Where does Kalu live? Speak up. - Sir. Sir, he lives in the Chembur forests, on the water tank. And he is Chandu's killer. Get up, Kalu. Your death has come to you today. - Ramu? - Give me the note, my money! Move your leg away. Give me my money or else I'll break your bones, today. I tell you. I tell you to give me my money or else I'll break your bones, today. Kalu! No Kalu! No. No Kalu! I won't let you die today. Let go of my hand. I won't let you die now, Kalu. First give me my money. Then you can go and die! - LLet go, Ramu. - Till then I won't let you die. Ramu let go. Ramu... Let go of me, Ramu. I ask you to let go, Ramu. Ramu! Okay, Ramu, let me come up. Let me come up. Ramu! Ramu! Wait Ramu. No, Ramu. No. - No, Ramu. No. - Give me my money, Kalu. Kalu, give me my money. - No, Ramu, no. - Or else I'll let you slip. - I'll let go of you, Kalu. - I'll give you the money, Ramu. Pull me up, Ramu. Ramu, I'm giving it. I'm giving you the 100-rupee bill, Ramu. This was nothing to fight over, Ramu. I was only joking. If you needed the money so badly, why didn't you tell me me earlier? Hurry up, Kalu. I have to go. Kalu! This knife... you stole it, Kalu. Whenever I tried to improve my life... you pushed me into the darkness of ruin. You, Kalu. You did that. I won't forgive you. Now, I won't forgive you, Kalu. I won't forgive you, Kalu. Ramu! Ramu, get out of here. Run away, Ramu. Or else I'll kill you, Ramu. Kalu! Now only my corpse will leave here. Acharyaji, hasn't Ramu come yet? I won't let you go, Kalu. I won't let you go, Kalu! Ramu, go back or else I'll cut the rope. Even if you slit my throat today, Kalu... I will cut the rope. Cut the rope, Kalu... but give me back my money. Ramu! Police? Ramu, the police have come! Ramu, police! Acharyaji, I'm coming. I'm coming, Acharyaji. I'm coming, right away. - Kalu, where's Ramu? - I don't know. I ask you, where is Ramu? Stop. I don't know who thrashed him so cruelly. I think he should be taken to the hospital immediately. Yes. Hold him carefully. Cover him with a blanket. Cover him. Stop brothers. Where are you taking my Ramu? Ramu? - Ramu. - What happened, my son? - Ramu, open your eyes. - Brother. - Ramu. - Brother, look, I got married. - Brother! - Ramu, son. Ramu, see, this is your Chabili. - Ramu, open your eyes. - Brother! My Ramu! - Chabili. - Ramu! Ramu! Ramu! - My Ramu! - Mother! - Acharyaji! - My Ramu! Thank God! Acharyaji. Your trust. This note? I couldn't get the goods for the Ashram. But I've been successful in gaining your trust, Acharyaji. Ramu, I'm proud of you. Today you've made my faith unwavering. Did you see, Keshav? Didn't I say that my Ramu would come, most certainly? You are so fortunate... to have given birth to such a son. And Chabili, you are also so fortunate that... you'll be known as the better half of this worshipper of trust. Some admirer has entered in my dreams Won me over in a single glimpse - Did you hear? - Yes, do you agree? Goodness! She took my heart away Didn't mother say that as soon as Sandhya gets married... You too will get married! Swaying weather! Beautiful season! A damsel, fair like the moon Kohl in the eyes, perspiration on her face Goodness! She took my heart away
