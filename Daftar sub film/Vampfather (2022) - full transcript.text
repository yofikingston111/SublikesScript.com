[ominous music] [narrator] Vampires are things of legend. Problem with legends is they do not die. Whether you believe in the vampire or not, the vampire does not care. If the vampire is hungry, any throat will do. [sinuous, percussive music] And after you are sucked bone dry, the vampire disappears, and the legend continues. [unsettling musical flourish] [gentle piano music] You are taking forever. A camel would've been quicker. [sighs] So where are you from? Transylvania. Can't you tell? [gentle piano music continues] [insects chirping, door opens] [door thuds] [vampire growls] The teeth, darling, the teeth. [vampire hisses] [♪♪] Hey, what about paying me? Be happy you got away with your life. [driver] So not even like a little suckle? [dramatic music] [thunder cracking] [gentle piano music] [insects chirrup] [wolf howls] [owl hoots] [thunder cracking] [dark, eerie music] [ghostly voice whispering in indistinct language] [haunting music] [creaking] [dramatic musical flourish] [knocking] [banging] [doors creak] [clock creaks] [haunting music] Father, you didn't answer, so I let myself in. [thunder rumbles] Yes, I can see. [female vampire] So, you heard? Yes. [female vampire] Why didn't you answer the door? I have to save my energy. I have very little left. I know. Nice to see you, though, even though... [banging] [tense music] Stay put. [ghostly screaming] [quiet ominous music] Vampfather. [hisses] Brandusa. [growls] [thunder rumbles] [tense, eerie music] Brandusa, Grigore, nice to see you both. You're looking well, Vampfather, under the circumstances. [tense music] Sit. [soft, eerie music] [bats screeching] Brandusa, Daciana, Grigore, been a while. Sorry I'm late. One more minute and I would have met my fate. Finally, after all these years, you learn to open the door by yourselves. There's promise for your development. Too bad your development is coming to a mortal end. We are immortal. We've been around for 6,000 years. Granddaughter, you've always been the feisty one. [huffs] There's no blood to feast. I'm starving. [vampires growling] [swirling music] Your second cousin Grigore needs the most blood. He comes form the older tribe. Your sister Daciana needs the least blood, but is the weakest. Nicolae, my good nephew, has the mutation where he can temporarily survive on bat blood. But all our strengths and weaknesses befall us tonight. [dark, suspenseful music] The blood of man has become too pure with virtue. Our hopes of man falling prey to the evil side dissolved with the free choice of kindness and selfless love. We are the last of the vampire. All our species are gone, but for us remaining. [dramatic music] [vampires chant in indistinct language] [liquid dripping] [music intensifying] [thunder rumbles] We have survived thousands of years to be outsmarted by mortal man. Fuckers! Just one last bite. It would kill you instantly. But I'm so hungry. Me, too. [dark music] I have a farewell gift for all of you. [chest lid creaks] [ominous choral music] [Vampfather sighs] Now... you will plunge the stake in the bullseye middle of your heart. Carefully, do not miss the point, or the pain will be worse than the death. Not my idea of a holiday. Is there no other way? [echoes] No. [Grigore growls] It makes me wanna do something bad! [growls] That's all we've done for thousands of years--bad. Something forbidden in the vampire codes. Like what? No, children! You shall go out with honor. It's the only sensible thing to do. You only have hours, a day or two, before you die of starvation. This... is the way. [dramatic music] Pity. The treasure trove goes to waste. [sighs] What treasure? The Nazi plunder taken from the Jews. What about it? I've kept it secret since the war's end. [whooshing music] What good are sparkles and glitz going to do me now that I am going to be dead? [Daciana] Now I'm interested. Embarrassed to admit I was getting soft for the Jews. I don't care about the fucking Nazis, other than their blood was spicy. But I was finding myself softened for the Jews. Those heartless Gestapos. Not that we are merciful, but we kill to live, and those Nazis wasted good blood for sport. Well? In the castle of Wewelsburg, I had myself a nice feast of some Nazi throats. [sighs] But before I killed them all, I heard Heinrich Himmler talk of the looted treasures from the murdered Jews. And you know where this treasure is? [laughs] Of course I do. Even the worst of beasts will spill their hearts out just to live one more breath. Transylvania? Yes. In the canyon of caves beyond the graves, before the burnt forest, seven kilometers southeast. [ominous music] What are you writing? Just in case the descendants want to find it. Hm. Since when do you care for the human? Lots change when one is thinking their last. [creaking] You stared at that note for an awful long time, Grigore. [Grigore hisses] [Grigore growls] Put your teeth away. I'm your cousin, for fuck's sakes. [Grigore] No need to take chances. It's been hidden for all these years. Let it remain so. Stop! I've listened to you quarrel about earthly monies. Have you learned nothing about worthless trinkets? [staff thuds] It's time! [dramatic music] Who will be the first? [dark music] Oh, good, Grigore. You are brave and an honor to our species. [dark music] I'd bite her neck, if I could. To die in vampire sin. I'm aroused. [growls] Stop! How dare you! [thunder rumbles] Now, Brandusa and Grigore have withered into shame, I again ask, who will be the first to die honorably? [dramatic music] Ah, yes, Nicolae. Of course. Not as you wish, Vampfather. The will to live is much stronger than any code of honor. I propose, whoever can drink the other's blood, do so. [vampires growl] [Vampfather sighs] [dark, eerie music] Yes, how inviting. Nice knowing you all. We had a good run at it. It's been 6,000 years. [growls] When you feel the bite of my wild fangs, know no hard feelings. [roars] Hit the lights! It's survival of the fittest. [roars] Fool! [dramatic music] Wayward ways of kin. The last surprise will come at sundown. [Brandusa roars] [Vampfather] Will come at sundown. [droning ambient music] Will come at sundown. [Grigore snarls] [Vampfather pants] Will come at sundown. [wheezes] [dramatic musical flourish] [bats screeching, wolves howling] [dark music] [knocking, sighs] Can I ever be on time? [knocks] [thunder rumbles, fire crackles] [mysterious wheezing and moaning] Hello? It's Sasha. So sorry I'm late, as usual. [ominous music] Vampfather, I'm sorry. What time is it, anyway? I had so many errands to do, and I kept repeating to myself, "Don't screw up because he told us to be on time." And I guess I screw up once again. Vampfather, forgive me. I don't want to be on time. I don't want to die. [thunder rumbling] [dark, mournful music] Goodbye, Vampfather. May we meet in some other world. [somber organ music] [suspenseful ambient music] [music intensifying] [somber, eerie music] [doors creak] [somber, eerie music] -[dramatic music] -[Grigore growls] [gasping] [music intensifying] -[stake thunks] -[Grigore roars] [chest squishes] [tense music] [Grigore hisses] Sasha. So nice seeing you. Yeah, been a long time. [Grigore moans] [thunder rumbles] [somber music] [rhythmic ticking] So, I'm the last. [tense music] Is there something I'm supposed to say? Fuck it! There is nothing that special. [stake splinters, clatters] What the fuck? [dark music] May blood be plenty in the next world. [stake thuds, clatters] Damn God or Satan or whoever the screw up is, let me perform last rites! Well, we had a good reign. What--6,000 years? [dramatic music] [tinkling music] Fuck me. You screw up everything. No wonder I'm always late 'cause I know it doesn't matter. [dark music] [light music] [keyboard clacking] Shades, looking chic. Glare from the computer. Uh-huh. Why you wear different color sneakers? It's one of my kinks. Okay. It's not a problem with me if you wanna show your fangs. You can do that too. [Sasha hisses] [chuckles] You know, I have a dentist that can file those down on a cheap layaway plan. I like them, Chérie. To each his own. [light music] [Chérie hisses] [Sasha] We have a party to go to tonight. I'm beat. I'll take a rain check. It's only one time a year. Come on, girl. [yawns] But what am I gonna wear? It's Halloween! Anything you want, baby. [chuckles] Trick or treat. [chuckles] Ass. [Chérie] Let's dress up together. [percussive rock music] [ghastly wailing, groaning] [screaming] [roars] -Good? -Yeah, yeah. All right. Yeah. [man snarls] [♪♪] [screaming] [roaring] [man snarls] Viva la vampire. Thank you. [screaming] Hey, watch those hands. [cackles] [man snarls] What is this, a vampire convention? [snarls] I'd like your neck for a kiss. I'll kick your balls up your throat if you don't fly back to your cave. Why so antagonistic? It's not like you. [Sasha] He gave me the creeps.

You act it. All right. So, you're feeling this, too? Feel what? Playing dumb, sexy. What? I didn't know you were.

I think you need to see a doctor. [thunder rumbles, rain patters] [percussive music] [vampires snarling, ghostly moans] [sputters] Hey, watch them hands. Come on, it's my teeth that want you, baby. Careful, they look sharp. Hey, I told you, watch your hands. It's not my hands that are the problem, baby. It's your hands. They could dominate the world. What do you do for a living? Professional womanizer, eh? I find dead bodies. Oh, how exciting. -Oh, you're a cop? -Yeah. -At least I'm safe. -Yeah. Safe, my ass. Hey, your ass wasn't up for grabs, so I've moved on. You're drunk, and he's horny as fuck. -He's just a cop. -Looks like a dirty cop to me. How about a threesome? No? [percussive rock music continues] [traffic hums] [soft music] [mysterious clicking, thud] [Sasha] Dr. Blood. [soft moaning] Is that your real name? What? Oh, B-L-O-U-D, but people mispronounce it, so I took on the name Blood. Dr. Rainier said I can trust you. Yes, Rainier, he was your family doctor since you were a child. Yes, all of us would go for all sort of cures. Mm. Am I going to live? Mmm. Yes, yes, for a while. Mm-hmm. What kind of while? Yeah, we have a very unique physiology. There's something in your blood that makes you immune to the vampire extinction. However, you're aging as a regular human. [chuckles] But I do need blood. Well, you said you haven't had blood for months now. Yes, I'm determined. [Dr. Blood] If you needed it, you'd be dead by now. What are you saying? Mmm... Ah, it's psychosomatic. You've been conditioned to think you need to drink blood. But I can dissolve in sunlight. So you think. Have you? I don't think so. [laughs] See? Sunlight is good for you. Mm. Are you saying I'm a human? Uh, no, you are definitely of vampire genealogy. However, something in the inbreeding has created a mutation that's caused you to be unique. So, without a microscope, what differs me from being a real human? Just your desires and choices. If your desire to drink blood becomes overwhelming, you will be vampire. However... [chuckles] If you choose to drink a smoothie, you'll be human. [chuckles] Time will tell. Of course, your ancestry may be too overwhelming for your subconscious to simply just wish away with a New Year's resolution. But, tell me, Sasha, how does it feel to be the last remaining vampire, the sole survivor? Let me be the last and be done with it. Well, that doesn't sound like a love affair, now, does it? You know, if you change your stance on this, you could--well, there is a way to propagate the species. Why would I want to? [Dr. Blood laughs] Well, it would be such a shame to let such a magnificent species just, like, become extinct. Think of it! I mean, it would be-- it would be like resurrecting the dinosaurs. [Sasha] God forbid, we'd all be eaten alive. [Dr. Blood] Not necessarily. Some will take a hit for the team. -[chuckles] -Wow, listen to you. You'd think you were a vampire. Oh, I wish. But, if you change your mind, you know where to find me. [soft, tinkling music] [Dr. Blood] Sasha. You can trust me. [Sasha] Would you know a good doctor for my head? [traffic hums] [phone rings] [office worker] Afternoon. [phone rings] [office worker] Aye, smoking hot, girl. You're late. You noticed. I'm sorry about last night. Whatever. You look tired. Hangover from the lonely punch. Are you going to be mad with me for a long time? It's in my DNA to be angry. My mom was angry; my dad was angry. Why shouldn't I be? So break the lineage. Come on, let's go to the kitchen and get some coffee. [light music] [Sasha] I saw a doctor. My blood is unique. I didn't mean a doctor doctor. I meant a shrink. Yeah, that's next. I have an appointment. Look, I'm sorry. I just thought we had something. It's no big deal. Come on, next on the roof. I have something important to tell you. Did you change your mind? Kind of. Wow, this is getting sexier by the minute. Ooh, is it hot in here or is it just the two of you? It's a gloomy day. Maybe I should get us some tequila? Chérie, I didn't bring you here as a romantic thing. You said you changed your mind. Not about that. Okay, move out of the way. I'm gonna jump. [thunder rumbles] Please, I have something really important to share with you. It's not like I'm not into you. I mean, I love you as my friend, but I also have other feelings for you. What other kind of feelings? Like, you know. Like sexual feelings? I knew it. [curious, sentimental music] [heart pulsing] Damn, what the fuck is wrong with you? Why do you keep playing me like this? I'm a vampire, and, if I get too excited, I'm going to bite your neck and drink your blood. Yep, you need a doctor. Chérie, I'm serious. I'm serious, too. Why do you think I have these? An overbite? Chewing too hard on your fucking rubber baby bottle nipple 'cause your selfish, sick mom wouldn't give you a soft breast? It was a nice day until you ruined it. [percussive, emotional music] [traffic hums] [soft, ominous music] [intercom beeping] [light, tinkling music] Oh, you can go in. [♪♪] Dr. Blood explained. You don't evaporate in the sunlight, like the others? Yes. So, why carry an umbrella? Habit, I suppose. I want to say a neurosis. Leave it with me, on my foot. [Sasha] Dr. Oomious. [Dr. Oomious speaking foreign language] [Dr. Oomious] It is me. What is it? Can't you choke? Huh? Oh, only if I internalize your suggestion, which, uh, I'm not gonna do. Oh! So, I shall not do that. So, Sasha, tell me, young lady, what is it-- [groans] that you'd like to resolve? [Sasha] Shouldn't it be me that lies on the couch? Well, if you'd rather be a patient. I--I'd rather you be a participating member in self-discovery. Okay? And, if you're hungry, I have more corned beef on my desk. Don't tell me you're a vegan, being a vampire. Ah, not a vegan, being a vampire, I can tell. [chuckles] You have an insatiable desire to be human? Since a child. Sasha, I'm sorry to inform you, I can't treat you. Why? Am I hopeless? Mm, no. [chuckles] Too much bleeding. I've been the family psychiatrist for years and years and years and years. It's just--whoa-- quite exhausting. I'm not like they were. I have dreams of getting better. How pipe they all are, huh? As you can see, although I'm quite hungry, I haven't bitten you. [Dr. Oomious] Quite sure of the long term effects. Not exactly like being bit by-- [sighs] A mosquito. You've been treating my family for years. I haven't been acting normal lately. Can you not make an exception for me? Sasha, I'm getting married soon, and my soon to be desperate, barren wife wants to have some kids, and I don't want the little tots to become--uh--vampires, you see? It's not working that way. Well, nobody's sure. Well, yeah, but I'm the last living vampire. There won't be any others. [laughs] I'm sorry, Sasha. I'm sorry, honey. In full disclosure, Dr. Blood has shared your charts, and you are, by far and away, the most human of all my patients, and now they're all, you know, they've all gone bye bye. They're all gone. And I'm gonna have to get another occupation, which is a shame. But what's really a pity is that we weren't able to make you a full human. But it's not in God's plan. It's just not, honey. A vampire is a vampire is a--whatever. You know what I mean; a vampire is a vampire. Pinocchio became a real boy. Pinocchio? Sasha, but Pinocchio had Disney on his side, and "I'll get you, my pretty! [cackles] "Ooh, where are my monkeys? "Oh, the house is falling; let's go back to Kansas!" [laughs] [ticking music] You didn't bite me. Told you. -Oomious? -Yeah? Are you Jewish? I eat corned beef. What do you think? [dramatic music] -What's that? -It's a secret map, leading to the Jewish treasure hidden by the Nazis during World War II. -Hm. -It might take a little sleuthing to find exactly where the cave is, but if you can find it. Why me? Heritage. You may be even more human than I thought. I just found my new occupation! [Oomious hums] [ticking music] [dark music] [thunder rumbling] [Grigore snarls] [thunder rumbling] [abrasive musical flourish] [abrasive music] [Grigore shouting] [Sasha pants] [high-pitched whistle] [coughs] [Sasha pants] [dark music] [Sasha hisses] [dramatic music] [thunder rumbles] [eerie music] [Sasha snarling] [eerie music continues] [snarls] [thunder rumbles] [light music] Finished my dissertation on creative literature. I'm going to leave my mark on the world! I bet. What the subject? Vampires! Speaking of things that suck. Boss man wants this in by five. Dreams. What about them? I wrote about a dream I had last night where you were going to suck my blood. What happened? You had second thoughts, and you left. That's good. As dreams go, it was so real. Do you wanna read it? No, I went there. Do you wanna go to the roof? I don't think so. Come on! I got something to tell you. Tequila, tequila, tequila. [soft, jaunty piano music] So what it is you want to tell me? Shut up and drink. Mm. That feels good. Might even be better than blood? [♪♪] [Sasha] I'm sorry, Chérie, I can't. I know, because you didn't. We will get fired. We're on top of the world, girl. No one can fire us; we fire them! You were right there, at the edge of my bed, hungry, desperate to drink my blood, but you didn't. It was only a dream. [dramatic musical flourish] No, it wasn't. My God. You know! [Sasha and Chérie laughing] [light, playful music] You smell so, so good. Mm! You're so pretty. [Sasha and Chérie laughing] [♪♪] That one is black, and that's white. Oh, you're super cool. [Chérie] It is cool. It's cool. [Sasha and Chérie chatter] [Sasha] It's here, it's here, it's here. [Sasha and Chérie laugh] [comical music] [both sigh] You're both fired. You have to talk to him first if you don't want to talk to me. [Chérie laughs] And you can't fire us 'cause we fire you. [Chérie chuckles] See what you made us do? You made us drink the whole bottle, and now there's none left. So let's have some more! [Chérie] Tequila! Sasha's right. You're fired. And Chérie, she doesn't need this stupid job. She's going to be famous on her literature. It's a book on dreams and wins the Pulitzer Prize, and you suck. [Chérie] Yeah, you suck. [Sasha and Chérie laughing] And the dream was real. So I'm gonna have Sasha bite your neck. [Sasha and Chérie laugh] I'm not gonna buy the book. I'm going to buy 10,000 of your book. [Chérie] Thanks. Wait. Are we moving or am I drunk? -[thunder rumbles] -[insects chirrup] [dark, eerie music] Neo. It's too quiet in here without you snoring. I can't sleep like this. Hey! [bed squeaks] Why are you being so quiet up there? Can't sleep. Oh, I see. You wanna play a game with me? [giggles] You playing the quiet game? [giggles] I mean, all right. Here I come. [suspenseful music] Neo. [♪♪] [woman whimpering] [woman screams] [dark music] -[siren wailing] -[helicopter buzzing] You gotta keep these windows closed. Vampire bats get, uh, flagrant during the lockdown. [police radio chatter] What are you doing? [chuckles] How's it look? -A lot better than he does. -Yeah. That's 'cause I'm not a normal cop. I'm a cool cop. [chuckles] Get in there. -[camera beeps] -[police radio chatter] I'm so sorry for your loss. It does get better. Can we get a statement from Miss Rejowski, please? -Ma'am. -Sir? Take her and get her statement, please. Ma'am, come with me this way. Outside here. [police radio chatter continues] [dark music] [camera beeps] Connor. What the hell are you doing? What the hell is that? Nothing, uh... Just a souvenir for my girl. That's evidence. What the hell? Great, good. [camera beeps] [dramatic music] [camera clicks] [knocking] Sasha, it's the middle of the night! I need your help. -How did you find me? -[Sasha] The scent. Keep it down. You'll wake the Missus. [ominous music] I don't think I can control myself any longer. Sasha, I really think you're better off in the care of Dr. Oomious. He doesn't want to see me. Look, I just--I can't help you anymore, I'm sorry. [Sasha pants] [light music] [panting] Sorry, honey. Sorry, just one of my clients. [chuckles] She thinks she's a vampire. [laughs] [sex doll squeaks] [dark music] [insects chirrup] [wolf howls] [eerie music] [dog barks] [♪♪] [wind whistles] I wanted to tell the doctor I think I'm having blackouts. [soft, suspenseful music] How beautiful. Can use to help grow. Or to kill. [dramatic music] [traffic hums] [thunder rumbles] [eerie, skittering music] [birds tweeting] Jan, when you came out to see if crazy Kevin was stalking ya, did you happen to notice if anyone took your dad's garden stakes? Just the vampires. Can you get off the phone, talk to your dad? No, just Mr. Rosen walking his dogs, Mrs. Blossom riding her bicycle, and the twins jogging. Maybe the twins were the vamps. Told ya! Well, they don't cast reflections in mirrors. Doubt the camera would pick up anything. Later, Jess. My dad's having a total breakdown. I can hear you. Folklore. There's a blackout for a few minutes. Dad, tonight, keep the windows closed so those ugly creatures can't fly in. I don't mean the flying kind. Do bullets stop the other kind? -[phone rings] -Good question. Go for Holmes. Copy that. Yeah, I'll be there soon. [car revs] [light music] [car revs] [clicking] [woman moaning] You watching porn on the beat? [phone beeps] Look, Holmes, you and I are tight, so I'm not gonna say anything, but it don't look good, you storing those vampire stakes in front of your house. They're garden stakes, for Christ's sake. I'm not saying anything. I'm just saying. What are you saying? Victims all had bite marks to the neck, and we're not talking about love hickeys. Forensics? Died of blood loss. Nothing conclusive yet on folklore. Folklore? Vampires. Bats? -No. -[scoffs] Right, the other kind of folklore. You tell that to the dead corpses left with going-away presents. Vampire stakes? Can I ask, why do you still wear the ring? [light, busy music] Okay, I guess I'm not saying anything, and I can't ask anything either. It, uh, gives me comfort, okay? [blinker clicking] [car revs] [♪♪] So where are we going? Looks innocent enough. Where'd you find her? My rose bed. Wait, in your garden of vampire stakes? Hey, I buried my dog in that garden. Okay. Where's this going? I'm just saying, stay out of my garden. Why would she leave it? [Holmes] Cry for help? Oh, I'll help her. [laughs] She's a looker. [snorts] This is official police business, okay, man? Not your little...porn play. I'm not saying anything, all right? Cut me some slack. Just saying she's, uh, mysterious is all. Junior, best watch yourself, all right? You'll find yourself the next victim. [♪♪] [traffic hums] [Holmes and Junior chatter] [Holmes] See what it says. [Junior] Sweet Sin Drive. Uh, I think it is... What is this? In case folklore isn't folklore. Come on. Come on. [comical music] [doorbell rings] [groovy percussion music] [doorbell ringing] Afternoon, Miss. Detective Holmes, Officer Junior. May we come in? -[Sasha] Why? -You are a person of interest. [Sasha] 'Kay, and why I am a person of interest for? -Does this look familiar? -[Sasha] My license. -How did you get it? -You left it in my rose garden. [Sasha] Oh, the one with the vampire stakes? Yeah. [whistles] Nice place. -Thank you. -[Holmes] Oh. You can see the observatory from here. Please, have a seat. [♪♪] Is he okay? Junior's just never seen a vampire before. Well, if you've seen one, you've seen them all. [Holmes chuckles] [Junior chuckles] There's been multiple murders. One of your doctors as well as your boss. That's so sad. Do you wanna confess? Sure. How do I do that? You'll sign a confession admitting to the murders? Well, I'm not sure. I've been having blackouts. I'm sorry, Miss, we're gonna need to put this mask over your mouth for precaution. Precaution for what? Just do it. If it were up to me, I wouldn't. It's okay, Junior. [Holmes] You're right, Junior, it's not up to you. Put it on. [♪♪] You have nice hair. Sit down, Junior. [Sasha] I will talk to not anyone else. Please, arrest me. Then you're admitting to the murders. [Sasha] I just don't remember. [sighs] Well, can't arrest you on suspicion. We'll have to leave it at that, see what the evidence reveals. Look, here's my card, in case you wanna get coffee or something like- Don't listen to the rookie. He's still learning how to talk. Go to the car. [light music] [Sasha] You want your mask back? [Holmes] I may need it for the next one. [Sasha] I'm the last of them. [♪♪] Have a good day, Miss. Can I have my license back? Sorry, it's evidence. [tinkling, soft music] Detective Holmes, if the evidence reveals I'm the murderer, please kill me, and don't hesitate. Copy that. [soft, shimmering music] You think she did it? I don't know. [engine turns over] She got to you, too, didn't she? Don't let your dick get in the way of your gun. [car revs] [dramatic music] [traffic hums] [insects chirrup] [dark music] [knocks] [♪♪] Officer Junior. Wanna join me for some coffee? Wouldn't it be against protocol? Isn't being a vampire against protocol? [soft music] It's a really nice night out tonight. Yes, if you're a vampire. [clears throat] Excuse me, Miss, would you mind, uh, opening your mouth and showing me your teeth? [Sasha growls softly] Oh, you really are a vampire. Could be an overbite. But is it? I thought it was a coffee date. So it is a date. Depends. Is it a social meet or police business? I'd say it, uh, feels a lot less like business and more social. Looks can be deceiving. [gentle guitar music] I wanna kiss you. Want to or need to? And risk being bitten? You are a vampire? [laughs] I'm just fucking with you. [smacks] [bell rings] Geez, can't women take a joke anymore? Tell me about it, dude. [soft music continues] [siren wailing] [dog barking] [Sasha growls] [fence rattles] [dramatic music] [fence rattles] [ominous music] [Sasha and Junior moan] [wolves howling] [Sasha] Yes, yes. [traffic hums] [light music] Gas gauge is near empty. Wasn't like that when we clocked out last night. Maybe the vampires decided to drink gas instead of blood. [chuckles] Conservation. [Holmes] Very funny. Did you take the rig out last night? Uh, yeah, went for a drive, you know, with the cool wind in my hair. Thought I'd stop at Hotel Callie for some action. Very good. You opening for Leno now? [♪♪] Rough shave? Uh, hickey. [chuckles] [scoffs] Let me see it. What do you care about my hickey? -Come on, let me see. -No, get outta here. Ow! -It is a hickey. -Yeah. Cute. God, you know, you got no trust in me lately. Well, lately, you haven't been delivering. That's not what she said. Consider yourself lucky. About what? The only thing she gave you was a hickey. Wouldn't want those fangs near my stake. Look, I deliver, okay? I extracted some info. Apparently, there's a shit load of treasure involved. [dramatic music] [traffic hums] [siren wails] Shit! I had no idea what kind of shit load. [gas nozzle rattles] Watching porn again, slick? So, do you remember that info I was telling you about? Apparently, the Nazis stashed billions of the Jews' treasure in some cave. [Holmes] Ole Miss Hickey tell you that? Yeah, yeah, said she had the map, but she gave it to one of the victims who was later murdered. Let me guess, blood sucked out. Yeah, murdered. [engine turns over] Hm. So, uh, where'd she find the map? Some relative. So let me get this straight. There's... [clears throat] A murderer that's looking for hidden treasure. [Junior] Yeah. Gonna be one rich son of a bitch. [Holmes] Did your little fang fatale tell you that she's the last one, that all the other ones are dead? The last of who? The last of the vampires. [chuckles] Yeah, yeah, she told me that. Like I'm gonna believe that wild stuff. And that the treasure's in a cave in the mountains of Transylvania? Wait, wait, how do you know what she said? Check your pocket. Oh, you son of a bitch. [dark music] You know--look who can't be trusted now, huh? This is also against my privacy and it's against the law. Tell Internal Affairs. You know, while you're at it, tell them you are now a person of interest because you're sleeping with the suspect. Since when is she a suspect? Since all the victims have vampire bites, and she's the last vampire. A--vampire bats. [Holmes] Yeah, how do you know? Did you see the forensics? Anyway, the other kind are folklore. Yeah, I used to think so. I'm not too sure anymore. Mind if I tell Internal Affairs? [scoffs] They'd lock us both up. Hungry, slick? [Junior] Yeah. [Holmes] Let us eat, hm? [engine turns off] [Holmes grunts] [upbeat music] [bottle clanks] Sandwiches? I could really use a beer with these. Ask and you shall receive. Holy shit. [bottle opens] Can't we get in trouble for drinking in the car? We're two cops. Breaking the law. I won't tell if you won't tell. I ain't saying nothing. [bottle opens] Here's to nabbing a suspect. Say, uh, how far would you go in breaking the law? Meaning? Meaning if we dig up the treasure... What's the harm in sharing some? Sure, we'll just fly out to Transylvania. You were listening. You heard it. Mm. As soon as you were about to climax, I stopped. I mean, I don't need to hear you finish, ugh. Thanks for the respect. So what did she say? [ethereal music] Oh! Look who's in control now. The treasure's not in Transylvania any longer. Where's the treasure, shithead? Whoa! Take it easy. So, we gonna split it? Not unless I split your dumbass head open first. And what about respect for the Jews? [dark music] We're not gonna take it all, just a percentage, for our inconvenience. Now you're talking. I'll cheers to that. Let's go. I just started my fucking sandwich. Well, I'm hungry for treasure now. Eat your sandwich. Thank you. [insects chirrup] [wolves howling] [owl hoots] [Junior] I don't even wanna know what's in there. Yeah, let's just skip by that. [Holmes] Are those coffins or cabinets? [Junior] I don't like them either way. [Holmes] All this time, I thought it was folklore. [Junior] I just hope the treasure ain't folklore. [Holmes] I don't get the Count thing. Dracula set a precedent or something? Why not Baron, Duke, Earl, or Marquis? [dog barking] [Junior] It's tradition. Yeah, well detective tradition's telling me that something ain't right. It's not an amusement park. It's a graveyard. Look, suck it up, okay? We're about to be rich. [Holmes] Which grave? How am I supposed to know? [Holmes] Hey, you didn't tell anyone about this, did you? No. -Except Connor. -What the fuck? You told that creepy klepto we were out here? He didn't believe me. Right. Who would? Gotta calm down. [ominous music] What am I even looking for? [Junior] I don't know. Just stay calm. [soft, suspenseful music] Found it. How do you know? Fresh prints and dirt. Nice work, Junior. [dog barking] So, when do we tell the department? Let's see what we've got first. After we take our share? Shh. Just dig. All right. [shovel crunches] [♪♪] [object jangles] [Junior] Shit, look at that. Is that real gold? There's an inscription. "To my beloved Anna. "I will love you all eternity. "Max, 1935." That's really sad. Whoa, dude, what the fuck? You can't just wear that. What am I supposed to do with it, throw it back in the cold dirt? Don't throw a fit. Holy shit! Look at this. It's the matching ring. "To my beloved Max. "I will love you for all eternity. "Anna, 1935." All right, no more digging. Oh, don't throw a fit. Look, how about this, okay? [rings jangle] And now they're together again. [Holmes] We're leaving. Come on. Don't be a bitch, okay? Just 'cause I put on the rings, we're gonna forego the treasure? [Holmes] Some things are sacred. Where's our dignity, huh? Those rings belonged to a man and wife who loved each other dearly, and they were murdered mercilessly by human animals. This treasure belongs to the deceased and their ancestors. That could've been us, murdered in cold blood. No, we're done here, man. I'm calling it in. [Holmes sighs] Easy come, easy go. [rings jangle] [soft, emotional music] -[gun clicks] -Pick the shovel back up. [tense music] I thought you didn't believe me. You believed me. I didn't believe you, stupid-o. Dig. [♪♪] No, this stuff belongs to the sacrificed Jews. Yeah, and when you dig up the loot, I'm gonna sacrifice you and bury you in the grave, so. Why would we dig if you're just gonna kill us? Buy yourself some time. Dig. Hands where I can see them. While I figure out how to take down this money-hungry, bad cop. Guns. [tense music] -[gun bangs] -[Holmes grunts] I said Junior dig, not you! Junior, dig, or I'll shoot you in the leg and force you to dig anyway while experiencing excruciating pain. [Junior] One bullet might have been loud enough to alert some dog walker nearby to call the cops. Another bullet will surely seal your fate. -[gun bangs] -Dig! Or I'll shoot you in the arm anyway, and force you to dig in double excruciating pain. You're as bad as the fucking Nazis! Yeah, well, not exactly my heroes, but I'll take it as I'm a bad ass. -[gun bangs] -[Junior groans] The more blood you spill from me, the more I stand unified with the martyrs. [gun bangs] [Connor] You don't stand. You're lying next to the filth. Leave him the fuck alone! [foot thunks] [shovel grates] [shovel clangs] [Connor grunts] Get up, get up! You know where this next deadly bullet will go? To the part of your brain housing the wild idea of compassion. The sound of your evil chant will be heard beyond the human. Oh, yeah? Like God saved the Jews? [Connor laughing] [laughing grows distant] [dramatic music intensifying] [gun bangs] [discordant music] [Connor's body thuds] [dramatic music] [Junior] Oh, thank God. Who are you? [chuckles] Dr. Blood. [chuckles] Hey, look, come--come get my cellphone out of my pocket. We can call Central. [tense music] Huh. [Dr. Blood chuckles] [gun clicks] [discordant music] What--what are you doing? Wait, why'd you do that? [Dr. Blood chuckles] Oh, you've gotta be kidding me? I have no sense of humor. That's why I laugh at all the wrong places. [chuckles] But Detective Connor had the right idea, except he's not gonna be the last one standing. [chuckles] Why are you doing this? Well, why does anyone do anything? Why not? [chuckles] Look, the treasure is right there, okay? Just take it. Of course I'm gonna take your treasure, and them I'm gonna suck your blood. [chuckles] Oh, fuck--fuck this. [Dr. Blood grunts] [Junior] What the fuck? [Dr. Blood laughs] My trademark! Aw, you're a fucking sicko! Well, maybe you think I'm a sicko, but this is a lifelong dream. Now, where do you want it, left or right? -Huh? -[Junior grunts] Oh, no, you don't. Every good vampire goes for the jugular. [chuckles] Ah, there it is, nice and pumped. [chuckles] [bat screeching] [dark music] [both scream] [dramatic music] [Sasha moans] That tastes so much better than smoothies. [dramatic, operatic music] [Junior grunts] [Junior] I thought you weren't the flying kind. [Sasha] I didn't know until now. Instinct rules. [dramatic music] [traffic hums] [siren wailing] [dark music] [bats screeching] [doorbell rings] [bats screeching] [dark music] Maybe you can teach us how to fly like that someday? Full report, boss. Just give me the meat and bones, kid. [waitress] Another meat and bones? Sure. Connor, the dirty cop, was real dirty. Dr. Blood, now Dr. Blood was something right out of a horror film. He used Halloween-style fangs to kill all of his victims. He was a folklore copycat. Went from idolizing one beast to another. Once he killed off his quota and got bored, he would pick up another folklore beast to continue to instill horror into the communities. How many did he kill? [cop] DNA tests just keep on coming. Dozens. All right, thanks, kid. Oh, I almost forgot. You have an invitation. What is it? Old family castle. [dramatic music] [wind rustles] [percussive, cultic music] [Sasha] It's here. [♪♪] I don't feel comfortable leaving you. Don't worry. It will be fine. After knowing the whole story, do you really expect me to believe that? No, but do. [door thuds] [bats screech] [cultic music continues] [doors creak] [bats screech] [vampires chattering] [vampire] Beautiful. Oh, it's bloody beautiful, and it's real blood. [vampires chattering] You were all dead. [vampires chattering] [Brandusa] My favorite! Grigore. Brandusa. -Oh, no! -Nicolae. -This is too much, you guys. -Daciana. No! [Daciana squeals] Blood, my favorite! Sorry, but can someone tell me how come you're not dead like I last see you? We were not dead, my child. We only looked that way. Well, we were almost dead. [Brandusa] Yeah, it was pretty nasty. [Vampfather] Here, sit down. A piece of cake, Vampfather? Ah, just a--no, no, no, no, I'm watching my weight. These youngsters have not yet learned the lesson of patience or sacrifice. I told them there was a surprise coming. Oh, can I tell her, Vampfather? See what I mean about patience? See, the deadly stakes were only meant to test our resolve to stay true to our species. Let me continue. I hate listening. Us vampires were truly dying, not able any longer to survive on the pure blood of the purified humans, so we had to go-- So mighty Vampfather, our patriarch, had Dr. Switchfire in Transylvania create a special toxin applied to the tip of the stake, and once the tip of the stake employs our heart, our blood evolves with the serum to accept the human blood once again. Okay, all sit, everyone. [dark music] This all, I'm sure, has been a very traumatizing journey for Sasha, who, since a child, her only dream was to become a real human. [music stops] You are more human than you know. I can still fly. [dark music] New Century resolution: we shall fulfill our survival requirements while doing the human society a moral favor. We shall feed only on the blood of evil humans. [growls] Though far and in between, there are sufficient numbers to keep our bellies full. [Grigore] Good, Vampfather, because I am hungry. [vampires snarl] Sasha, what is the matter? Yeah, your idea is really good. So? Is there a way for me to become a real human? Come, my child. [vampires chatter] [Grigore laughs] There is a way. Now, it has never been done before, and it won't be easy. Really? You must bite yourself on the neck. That's impossible. It's never been done before, and it won't be easy. [Sasha] But how, Vampfather? There is a reason why we do not cast a reflection. [dramatic, sweet music] [♪♪] [narrator] In the end, the beauty of legends is, if you believe with all your heart, the legend creates miracles. [dark, dramatic music] [eerie, haunting music] [bats chittering] -[Grigore roars] -[woman screaming]
