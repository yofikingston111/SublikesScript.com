Where is daddy? - Daddy? Come with me. Daddy! Daughter, why did you come? - Daddy, its 9 o'clock. Come quickly? - Where? Where? Have you forgotten? Why didn't you remind him? What is the matter? What have I forgotten? Today Mr. Suraj is going to come. And you had promised me that.. You would come with me to the station. Yes, daughter but.. But it is very important for me to stay here at this time. Look, do one thing, take Rakesh along. There is no need. I can go alone too. She has become angry. What can I do Rakesh? My work is like that. I don't get time to stay and look after my daughter. But now your problems will get over, since Mr. Suraj is coming. Yes, once I complete the promise I made to Suraj's father. Get them married. After that I can wash off my hands. You and Suraj's father were very good friends. Yes, often people used to think me to be his younger brother. Before dying he handed me over his entire property. Today when Suraj will come I will also get unburdened.. Of this heavy load worth millions. Is wealth a burden, professor? Yes, Rakesh. If it belongs to someone else then it a very huge burden. Come. He has come. He has come. Junior master has come. First a garland in your neck and then greetings from Gangaram. Wow, Gangaram, wow! The same old Gangaram with his old talkative ways. Junior master, I have been talking.. With these walls since last 10 years. At least allow me to talk today to my heart's content. - You have to talk? - Yes. - Standing here? First wear this garland and come inside. - Let me get the luggage. - All right. Everything is there the way it was before. I have returned after so many years.. But it feels I was always here. I had thought that you must have forgotten everything. Rita. There are things which cannot be forgotten. Mother used to sit on that chair and knit sweaters. Father used to sit there and read newspapers. And you used to make this chair a horse and ride on it. A small girl used to come to play with you. And when you used to get angry and pull her hair.. Then she used to cry. Do you remember? Now where is that little girl? Now that girl has grown up. Does she remember me till now? There are things which cannot be forgotten. A right turn from ahead. Hey, this mansion is still standing here. I don't know, but I was always interested in this place. Come, let's go inside. I had written my name in one of its doors in childhood. Come, let's go and see, if it is still there or gone. Come. Come. Come. Come. Rita! See my name is still here. There used to be a chain here too. See there. Strange! These bells still ring. Cone on, let's go now. We have to go far. Suraj! Daddy! Hey, you have come. Where is Suraj? Hello, Suraj, my boy. Professor. Welcome home. Welcome home. I have been waiting since long. My eyes had got tormented. You have grown up. You have changed so much. - Sorry, I couldn't come to the station. - No problem. Daddy, I have explained everything to him.. That nothing is more important for you than work. Look, he has not come home since two days. Now she has this complaint from me. And I am also helpless. Dear, now you make her understand. For a man like me work is veneration and devotion. Professor, even I couldn't understand this. What is there in excavating these old ruins? What is the use? What is the use? Even I cannot say so. But I surely know that these old ruins.. Are the foundation of the new generation. It's a relation. Culture is a chain. The entire world is tied with this chain. The success of man and of his achievements.. Is because of this very chain. And it is my duty and life to find the lost portions of that chain. Well said, sir. Well said. And that's why the professor is regarded.. As the biggest archaeologist in India. Rakesh, meet Suraj. Suraj, Rakesh, my assistant. - Pleased to meet you. - Thank you. - Professor. Professor. Master, we have found the steps to another dungeon. - Wonderful. Come. - Excuse me, please. Daddy has found one more part. - I think, we should return now. - Come. - Hey. - What happened? I forgot to give daddy his medicine. Wait here, I will just come in a minute. May I move my neck? No, just a minute more? That's it. I am tired. Hey, you people here? We should be asking you, what are you doing here? We had planned a picnic a week ago.. And you had promised to come. - Actually, he has arrived today. - He? - Suraj. Okay so he is the one, for whom you were waiting. Drat. - Lovely. Beautiful. - Who the painting or the artist? Yes? Suraj, all these are the members of our youth club. - All right, greetings. - Greetings. Rita, you go to your picnic with them. I will leave. Where are you going? - If you are not there, even Rita won't stay with us. - Why? Is it something to be questioned? Come on, Mr. Suraj. You have to come to the picnic. What will do by going there? I don't know anything. You have snatched our Rita from us as soon as you have.. Come and you are saying that you don't know anything. You are so innocent. Yes? Is he innocent or a rat? Ask that of Rita. Rita I will leave. "To desire something from you cruel person." "Maybe the work of other people." "I just want to see... how cruel you are." "What is love?" "I will fall in love and see." "What is love?" "I will fall in love and see." "What is known as punishment?" "I will go and smitten by someone." "What is love?" "You have made a beautiful promise with my heart." "That I have made my mind to die for you." "That I have made my mind to die for you." "Where is the noose of love?" "Where is the noose of love?" "I will go wear this noose too." "What is known as punishment?" "I will go and smitten by someone." "What is love?" "For all my love is waiting a question." "See with your intoxicated eyes, the glass of my heart is empty." "For all my love is waiting a question." "See with your intoxicated eyes, the glass of my heart is empty." "How does it get split?" "How does it get split?" "I will fill the glass and see." "What is known as punishment?" "I will go and smitten by someone." "What is love?" "How long will you test me, my darling?" "Be kind and smile and tell me what your decision is." "Be kind and smile and tell me what your decision is." "On your decision." "On your decision, I will die with happiness." "What is love?" "I will fall in love and see." "What is known as punishment?" "I will go and smitten by someone." "What is love?" A thousand years old painful story.. Was closed in this room till today. The dust had got mingled with dust. Rakesh! Rakesh! See. See these bangles match. From this we can know that the skeleton.. Was of the same girl whose this is. I believe that we have found a lost chapter in history in these ruins. Photograph this statue from every angle. From every angle. - Why? What had happened? - I don't know. I will go and see. What happened? Rita, did you hear anyone laughing just now? No. Why? Nothing. The car has heated up. You sit. I will just go and bring water. "Every part of heart... prays." "My heart broke, but you didn't... hear its sound." "But you didn't hear the sound." "Every part of heart prays." "My heart broke, but you didn't hear its sound." "But you didn't hear the sound." "Every part of heart." "I am waiting for my goal." "And my goal is in front of me." "I had to tell him that destiny is very wicked." "I am waiting for my goal." "And my goal is in front of me." "I had to tell him that destiny is very wicked." "The nature weeps by stealth on my condition." "My heart broke.." At last you have come. I knew that you will surely come. Who are you? Didn't you recognise me? No. You have forgotten me? I have not forgotten you, Suraj. How do you know my name? I know everything about you. Today you have returned to this place after ten years. After becoming a great artist. But, who are you? Me? I am a girl. You here alone, so late at night. Aren't you scared? Scared? You are with me. I was never scared with you. Go. Someone is waiting for you. My name is Kiran. You wanted to ask my name, right? Yes. - Why were you so late? - I met a girl there. A girl? So late at night? I was also surprised. She was a strange girl. - Wonderful! - Thank you. Rita, tell him to make my picture too. Drat, the naughty girl! Wow! Very nice! What do you think about these pictures? The more I praise the lesser it is. Wow! Only the life is lacking. Thank you. This is no new thing. Your fingers always had this magic. Yes? - Are all your paintings here in this exhibition? - Yes Wrong. One painting is not here. Which one? The one which is not finished. The one which you had started a long time ago. But couldn't complete it till now. How do you know? I will leave. He has made your picture very beautifully. Hey, where did that vehicle go? - Which vehicle, sir? - That horse cart. The one which had come out of this tunnel just now. From the tunnel. No horse cart came out of it, master. I am working here since morning. No, horse cart came out! "Great master, if you permit us." "Then we will say this to the entire world." "Great master, if you permit us." "Then we will say this to the entire world." "We are smitten by your attitude." "Who have said, that we are scared?" "Great master, if you permit us." "Then we will say this to the entire world." "Great master. "Why shouldn't we say that love is God?" "What is it, if it is not reality?" "Why shouldn't we say that love is God?" "What is it, if it is not reality?" "Oh darling, place a bet." "I have handed over my heart to you." "There is great enjoyment to walk in stealth." "There is fun by getting struck and manage again." "Great master, if you permit us." "Then we will say this to the entire world." "Great master. "Just smile and see who is sitting near you." "Just smile and see who is sitting near you." "Oh darling, place a bet." "I have handed over my heart to you." "These lowered eyes had been enchanting." "We didn't know when it was unfair." "Great master, if you permit us." "Then we will say this to the entire world." "We are smitten by your attitude." "Who have said, that we are scared?" "Great master, if you permit us." - Suraj. - Yes. In the party you are giving tomorrow.. Why don't we fix their program in it? But the fact is.. "Every part of heart... prays." "My heart broke, but you didn't... hear its sound." "But you didn't hear the sound." "But you didn't hear the sound." "But you didn't hear the sound." "Every part of heart prays." "My heart broke, but you didn't hear its sound." "But you didn't hear the sound." "Every part of heart." "I couldn't understand what my fault was." "Why did I come to your party O world? "I couldn't understand what my fault was." "Why did I come to your party, O world? "No how many more births will separation burn me?" "My heart broke, but you didn't hear its sound." "But you didn't hear the sound." "But you didn't hear the sound." "But you didn't hear the sound." That girl. Where is that girl who was with you in the boat? - Why? - I want to meet her. - Why? - I want to know who she is. She is my daughter, Kiran. Your daughter? You want to know, where she lives. In the old mansion near the old road. But nobody lives there. Who says so? I live there. My daughter lives there. And some and some ghosts live there too. Who are you? I want to meet Kiran. You can't meet her. Why? - Don't argue. Go back. - Wait. Tell Kiran that there is a party tomorrow night. I will wait for her at sharp at 8:30. She will get your message. My name is Suraj. I know. Who will come to invite Kiran besides Suraj? Well, friends. Our research couldn't be completed till now. Yes, we have just come to know.. That there was dancing girl called Kiranmai. This is her statue. Professor, can you tell us how old are these monuments? Well, maybe 2,000 years old. Come on, friends. - Yes. - Come. Come here, Rakesh. Come. - Thank you. - Thank you. Come on. Come. Come. - Come here. - What about this, professor? This.. Guide them, I will just come. Pardon me friends. - I will be back in a jiffy. - Take your time. - Bye. Gentlemen, about this statue.. Rita? You her? What is the matter, daughter? Daddy, I am very tense. There is a girl on whom Suraj is very interested. Who is she? I don't know. She is a strange girl... and beautiful too. - She can never be beautiful than you. - But Daddy.. You are getting tensed uselessly. Go home. Maybe that girl will come to the party too in the evening. I will come too. There is no need to get flustered. Go. Go, home. I want you. I want you. - Excuse me. Daddy. - What is the matter, daughter? This is that girl. You have come? I knew that you will surely come. You will surely come. Come. Professor, this is Kiran. Kiranmai? No, only Kiran. Greetings. Where did you get these bangles? - These are mine. - The design is very old. - Yes, 2,000 years. - How do you know? - I wear them, that's why. - But why do you wear them? I like them. I want to keep the old culture of my country alive. Have you comet o the party or to argue? Professor, Kiran wants to see my studio. Come, Kiran. No, later. Strange, professor. These bangles.. But.. - But how is that possible? - I am thinking the same. Rakesh, wait here. I will just come. I am thirsty. Blast! Have you come to this city recently? - 2,000 years ago. - Don't joke. I am not habituated to joke. I have heard that you live in that old mansion. Is it true? - Yes. - Why do you live there? I love old things. They remind me of olden times. - Olden times? - 2,000 years ago. She doesn't seem to be 2,000 years old. May be she works in some theatre company. It is also possible that she has run away from some lunatic asylum. Rita! - You have no right to make fun of Kiran. - Fun? We just want to know who and what she is. It is enough for you to know that Kiran is my guest. Ladies and gentlemen. Today in our party a person has come.. Who is a living example of the lifestyle 2,000 years old. But I am sorry that she is a stranger to us all. I am sure that even you want to know that who, what and.. Rita! What misbehaviour is this? Who wants to know, who I am? "Maybe I am a stranger for you." "Maybe I am a stranger for you." "But the moon and the stars know me." "All these views know me." "Maybe I am a stranger for you." "But the moon and the stars know me." "All these views know me." "Every leaf here is my secret keeper." "I have placed tongue on every molecule." "Every leaf here is my secret keeper." "I have placed tongue on every molecule." "Everyone asks me today the same thing." "Why have my darling forgotten love." "I won't be pained even if you have forgotten me." "Because everyone in pain knows me." "All these views know me." "You were lost in the paths of disloyalty." "In every step there were signs of my loyalty." "You were lost in the paths of disloyalty." "In every step there were signs of my loyalty." "You left me breaking all promises." "My love was left as a story." "The promises which you couldn't... keep know me." "All these views know me." Wait! Why do you want to go away from me? Why do you want to come close to me? I? I.. I want to make your painting. Only painting? - Meet me tomorrow, in the after noon. - Where? Walk on the road which goes up to the heel by the lake. Stop where there are a lot of rocks. And wait. Watchman! Watchman! - Watchman! - Yes, master. Where did this statue disappear? Statue? I don't know, master. Did any outside person come? Here? Outside person? No outside person has come here, master. No one has come. Surprising. How can such a big statue disappear suddenly? After 2,000 years. No. No. This is impossible. This is impossible. This is impossible. Professor. Professor. See this is the history of those ruins. In the old books of Sanskrit.. You know I don't know Sanskrit. - Translate it and make me understand. - Yes. According to this book there was a city.. Called Chandrika Nagar 2,000 years back. - Is something written about that statue? - No. But something is written about that room where we found that statue. It was the studio of a sculptor. - He used to love a royal dancer. - Yes. And that royal dancer's name was Kiranmai. Kiranmai! What is written about her? Read it. Read it. Read it. That someone murdered her one day. - And it was left as a secret. - Yes. That is what is written. You wanted to meet me. I have come. Why are you surprised? You have as suddenly as someone comes in a dream. Did I use to come in your dreams? You have started to come. Come here. Sit. Look. That's it. Stay like that. Don't move. This picture will make me immortal in world. Only if it is finished, then? The way one of your other pictures is still uncompleted. If it is also left incomplete.. It won't be. I will complete it. You were so stubborn even before. When? It is stubbornness. To cut rocks and make idols out of it. Make idols? Idols of stone. The one who have neither a heart nor emotions. Even your heart becomes a stone working with stones. Kiran, what are you saying? I only make paintings. Is the painting over? No, I don't know what has happened to me today? Today the fog is shifting. Look there. "This is the place." "This is the weather." "This is where we two have met." "This is the place." "This is the weather." "This is where we two have met." "How can I forget them?" "This is where we two have met." "Here you have taken my hand in your hand.. And had promised never to get estranged." "You had hugged me... and told me that I am yours forever." "My loyalties will never decrease." "This is where we two have met." "This is the place." "This is the weather." "This is where we two have met." Kiran! Kiran! Kiran! What happened to you? This fog. I hate it. Someone becomes far away even if he is close. He gets estranged. Sometimes forever. When will this fog shift? Give me your hand. You will leave it. Never. I can leave everything in the world. I can leave the world. Not you. Yes, Kiran. Suraj. Kiran. Let it remain. It is very cold. - And.. And you? - The fire is there. You are wet. If something happens to you. - Let it happen. - Don't you even care for your life? No, my life is yours now. I have to live and die for you. Even die. Yes. "My life, I have loved you." "If you want you can even take my life." "When you are near me, I have everything with me." "What is life? You can even take my honour." "My life, I have loved you." "I had regarded you the God of love." "You tell me what you regard me to be." "What is life; it is only the benevolence of love." "I have really regarded pain as medicine." "My life, I have loved you." "If you want you can even take my life." "My life, I have loved you." "That is the heart which always sings songs of loyalty." "Go on loving the one it loves." "The moment when my lover's hand is on mine.. Is better than to live for a hundred years." "My life, I have loved you." "If you want you can even take my life." "When you are near me, I have everything with me." "What is life? You can even take my honour." "My life, I have loved you." Junior master, where were you the entire night? We were worried searching for you. There is no need to be worried about me in the future. Suraj. Where were you the entire night? I was trapped at a place in the rain and storm. Alone? No, even Kiran was with me. You, Suraj. Maybe I have not told you, the statue.. Have found in the ruins. Its face resembles Kiran a lot. And do you know, what is written underneath it? Kiranmai. It is just a co-incidence. Kiranmai was a royal dancer. She was murdered. Do you know the day that girl came to the party.. That very day that statue disappeared from the ruins. I can make you believe that Kiran.. Is a beautiful, healthy and a living girl. My Kiran is not related to your that Kiran or her soul. - Your Kiran? - Yes? I mean I know her a lot. Check this list. If any of your acquaintances names are missing then add it. What kind of list it is? Of the guest coming to your wedding. The date is fixed for the 8th of next month. Professor. I.. I don't want to get married so soon. Soon? Rita has been engaged to you years before. Still, I need some time. All right. I will come again tomorrow evening. Decide it. I cannot even keep my young daughter at home. Professor. If I decided against marriage, then? Then listen carefully, you will have.. To leave all your wealth, property and land. Your late father had decided to make my daughter.. His daughter-in-law. And not only that. He has even handed me the responsibility.. To decide about your welfare. Junior master, this letter was given to me.. By elder master during his illness. And had told me that give this letter to my son.. When he is in great problems some day. 'Son Suraj. I am missing you a lot today.' 'Maybe this is my last letter for you.' 'The doctors have raised their hands.' 'And I am just a few days left.' 'Today your professor uncle had come to meet me with Rita.' 'I had given him the oath to make his daughter Rita.. The daughter-in-law of my house.' 'Your mother wants the same.' 'This is my last wish that you get married to Rita.' 'Love, father.' No, this is not possible. I won't let this happen. I won't let this happen. Rita. - Today the professor had come to my home. - I know. He has given me time till tomorrow evening.. - To decide about marriage. - I know that too. And the decision is in your hands. I have been engaged to you long ago. But marriage is a question of entire life. There should be love in the two hearts. Rita, there a few things, where the heart cannot be controlled. Like, Kiran. Yes, I cannot stay alive without her. What do you want from me? - If you disagree to marry me.. - So that you can marry Kiran. - Does she know we are engaged? - Yes. Still she flirts with you. Do you know what such girls are known as? Rita! I can't hear anything against Kiran. You will have to listen. I hate her. She had trapped you by exhibiting her beauty and youth. Rita! She is a lowly, cheat and a dishonourable girl. She had snatched both your heart and mind. You can leave now. Wait! - You? - You want to lose your life. Look down. As it is there is no meaning to life without you. Do you believe in rebirth? What? Will you wait for me till the next birth.. If we can't meet in this birth? No, I will make you mine in this very birth. - And the one you have to marry. - I can leave her. I can leave everything to get you. Can you die? Do you want to test me? Not now. When the time comes. That time will never come now. Kiran, can you come tomorrow morning where the professor works? Why? Tomorrow I will tell him my decision in front of you. I will surely come. - You go now. - Come, I will drop you of. - No. I will go myself. Wait for me at 9 o' clock at night. - But I.. - Tomorrow at 9. Rita. Rita. What have you done, Rita? Have you gone mad? - Professor, take Rita from here at once. - But.. Hurry. There is no time to think. Please. Please. - What happened? - Everything is finished. - Did you get the corpse? - No, we won't find it either. Right behind the place she was shot.. There was ravine 2,000 feet deep. We should inform the police. What are you saying? Rita is your daughter. Yes, but she had committed a crime. She has committed a murder. Professor. I have come to tell you something. - I, I have decided. - What? I have decided to marry Kiran. I have called her here. She will come soon. Mr. Suraj, Kiran is among those girls who promise but doesn't come. - They play with the emotions of people like you but.. - But? No! This is impossible! This is impossible! Daddy, this girl is not human but surely some ghost. Rita. Child. Rita. Professor. How is Rita? She has gained consciousness but.. But? She isn't out of danger till now. Professor I have not heard such a strange incident till date. Whatever you have said is impossible. It cannot happen. But it has happened. Inspector my daughter is in the hospital. I want to reach the root of this matter. I want to know the reality. Please, come with me. Please. That girl lives here. Professor, I am the in-charge of this area. No one has lived in this mansion since the last 50 years. We know it very well, inspector, that girl lives here. At least, check the place. Come. Let's go. Break the door. Professor, nobody lives in the place, where snake lives. Come, let's go back. Inspector, he is the father of that very girl. You people won't let my daughter live in peace. Where is your daughter? You won't find her. Nobody will find her. Nobody will ever find her. Inspector, arrest him. Professor, I know this man well. He has become mad since his young daughter has died. Mad? - Yes, professor. Come. - But that girl. We will find her. We will find some other way to find her. Come. Let me go now. From now? It is not evening now. The sun has not set. Then how can Kiran (light) go. Because the Suraj (sun) is disloyal. It sets and lives the light back. The poor thing then wanders about.. Till the night doesn't envelope her. But as soon as it is morning the sun.. Comes like crazy after his light. - We will meet later. - When? I don't know. Wait for me. Kiran! "Promise me that you will meet me again." "Promise me that you will meet me again." "Promise one more meeting with me." "Promise me that you will meet me again." "Promise one more meeting with me." "Promise me that you will meet me again." "All the matters of the heart are still incomplete." "They are still incomplete." "One more meeting is necessary still." "All the matters of the heart are still incomplete." "They are still incomplete." "One more meeting is necessary still." "Promise me your company for a few moments." "Promise one more meeting with me." "Promise me that you will meet me again." "Why do tell me the beautiful secret of your heart?" "Why do you give me a new tune, a new song?" "I am drowned in the storms of love." "You are just calling me from the bank." "Promise me that these emotions will remain even tomorrow." "Promise one more meeting with me." "Promise me that you will meet me again." "Promise one more meeting with me." "Promise me that you will meet me again." Where the photographs of that girl? - These are the ones. - These are the ones? Only Suraj is in them. All the photos I have clicked had both Suraj and Kiran. Then why is Kiran's photo not here? Because you cannot take her photo. What do you mean? I mean that girl is not human. Not human? Even I had suspected it. I believe it today. I am taking these photographs, professor. Good night. The inspector is getting worried unnecessarily. - And no result will come out. - Why? Spirits are things beyond the reach of law and man. But spirits doesn't have any form, it doesn't have a body. They have the power to select the body they like and stay in it. You being a scientist, believe in all these things? Yes, I have started to. I have met an experienced sage regarding this matter. He was quite impressed by what he told me. What did he tell you? He said that if someone's desire stay unfulfilled.. Then his spirit keeps on roaming after death. And such a spirit needs the sacrifice of some life to free itself. If some man starts to love that spirit then he surely has to die. What else did he say? He said that spirits are seen on the first moon night. And they can stay till the 14th night of the moon. On the 14th their victim is dangerously affected. And that day the spirit takes someone's life. Rakesh! How can anyone believe all this things? The day Kiran first met Suraj that day was the first moon night. Tomorrow is the 14th moon night. And the last day in Suraj's life. Professor, please. I believe it. I fully believe that Suraj's life is in danger. We have to save him. No matter what. We cannot let him die. "My love is such that even after I die.. I won't allow you to get out from my arms." "My love is such that even after I die.. I won't allow you to get out from my arms." "Even if I get heaven." "I will ask God you instead of heaven." "My love is such.." "The world will keep on changing." "New tunes of life will be made." "But our love won't be erased." "But a thousand excuses will be made to erase it." "Reality will always be reality." "It will never turn into a tale." "My love is such that even after I die.. I won't allow you to get out from my arms." "My love is such.." "My love is not so helpless, that.. Someone will snatch you from my arms." "My heart even doesn't like the... moon light touching your body." "Even if someone meets, I am taking an oath on you.. My heart will burn." "My love is such that even after I die.. I won't allow you to get out from my arms." "Even if I get heaven." "I will ask God you instead of heaven." "My love is such.." You? Yes, I am waiting for you since a long time. Why? To ask your forgiveness. Yes? Suraj, I.. I mean to say, the love for my daughter had made me selfish. As your guardian, I should have thought about your joy. I, I didn't understand. It was my mistake that I tried to force you to marry Rita. It was my mistake. You love Kiran. You will be happy by marrying her. Professor. Yes, I don't have any objections now. I bless you that the joys of the world come to you. - This is my prayer. - What are you saying? Dear, I am sorry for my mistake. Enough, uncle. Don't embarrass me anymore. Professor. Take this ticket. - When will the train come? - At 3 o' clock. But how will you go? We have to fetch Rita from the hospital today. Okay, but it is more important for me to go. You are going out somewhere. Yes dear, regarding your work. It is property dispute. The lawyer have telegrammed me. Rita is not well, professor. Won't it do if Mr. Suraj goes? - It will but.. - No, problem. I will go. It is only a matter of one day. Just to go and come. But I don't want to exert you. Maybe you have some important work here. What are you saying, uncle? You look after Rita. I will go and prepare for my departure. Rakesh, the work is done. Listen; be with him all the time. Don't leave him alone for a moment. And remember, it is your job to keep him away from here. It is very important for Suraj's life to stay away from Kiran tonight. Be rest assured, professor. This thing won't happen again. - Mr. Rakesh. - Yes. - How long is the journey? The journey has just started. Are you bored? - If you want shall we play cards to pass the time? - Do so. All right. 'You are going. Leaving me. What have I said?' 'You have forgotten.' 'Come back.' 'Come back.' 'Come back.' - Kiran! - You were going, leaving me behind. No, Kiran, I have come back. But why did you go? I have told you that maybe today is our last meeting. And you have tried to go away from me today. Today we will belong to each other. I have decided to get married today. Kiran! Suraj, forget what has happened till now? Kiran! We can't get married. - Kiran! Do you love me? - I love you. I want to be yours forever. But I can't. What do you mean? Were you acting with me till today? Were you playing with my emotions? No. No, Suraj, no. I can't make you understand. You have to make me understand. I want to know which force on earth can stop you from being mine. You want to know. Yes. Then come with me. Can you see these ruins? It used to be Chandrika Nagar. King Sindhu Vilas had established it. Come. This was the room of the most prominent.. And famous sculptor of that time. Which the king had constructed especially.. To make a statue of his queen. Can you see this statue? It is of that same queen. But only the body is hers. The face belongs to someone else. See that. See here. And that. And who knows how many more statues that sculptor made. - But he couldn't make the queen's statue. - Why? Because he was deeply in love.. With one of the royal dancers of Chandrika Nagar. So much that he lost control over his hands. Unknowingly he used to sculpt the face of his Kiranmai on every statue. Kiranmai? Yes. And when he couldn't make the queen's statue.. After much endeavour then king Chandra Vilas was very angry. And he decided that he won't be able to make someone.. Else's statue till Kiranmai is alive. What happened then? The king had Kiranmai murdered. In this room. At this place. 2,000 years ago. How do you know all this? I am Kiranmai. Kiranmai's spirit who was estranged from.. Surya Prakash and is searching for him. Surya Prakash? It was your name. You still didn't understand. After many years Surya Prakash and Kiranmai.. Have met as Suraj and Kiran. - This is a co-incidence. - It is reality. You have forgotten it. You became mad with the shock of my death.. And went away God knows where. As soon as you left the volcano erupted And Chandrika Nagar was forever buried under that lava. You don't remember anything. Kiran, can all these be true? Yes and the proof is that we can't even become united.. Even meeting after so many eras. I cannot become yours. Why? I am a spirit. And your body is the block to our union. And if my body is longer there? We will become one. Forever. Then I will do away with this block forever. If I can't get you by staying alive.. Then there is no meaning to life. Then today. Tonight is the 14th moon night. This night won't come again, Suraj. This night won't come again. If we are not able to meet tonight then.. Stop it. I am ready to die this moment. Take him away. You would have taken an innocent man's life if I was late. I know very well, who you are. A rambling spirit. The one who needs the sacrifice of a life to free itself. But remember, it will never happen till I am alive. You will never be successful in your motives. You will be finished, but you won't be able to hurt Suraj. You won't be able to hurt him. Doctor, he shouldn't gain consciousness at no condition tonight. Be rest assured. His sleep cannot be broken before morning. The effect of the injection remains for 12 hours. - Thank you, doctor. Thank you. - Come, doctor. "The world had prevented our union every time." "When will you wake up from your sleep?" "When will this dream break?" "The world had prevented our union every time." "When will you wake up from your sleep?" "When will this dream break?" "If you don't wake up, then destruction will wake up." "My heart broke, but you didn't hear it." "But you didn't hear it." "But you didn't hear it." "But you didn't hear it." Kiran! You are so late. I was frightened that you won't come. No power could have stopped me today. See there. It is time. Are you ready? Yes. Then come with me. This is the place where we to will be united for ever. This is time for which we were waiting since 2,000 years. Don't think. Don't wait, Suraj. Unite with me by finishing your body for ever. No! No, Suraj, no! I won't let you die. I can't commit this crime. What is the matter? I am no soul or spirit. Whatever I have told you was a lie. Everything was false. I am an ordinary girl. I am an unlucky girl. Kiran! What are you saying? - Run away from here. - Why? - Your life is in danger. - What? - Don't ask questions. Hurry. Rakesh! Foolish girl, you have lost wealth and now even your life. No, sir. I am still alive. Baba, the police are still searching for you. You can be hanged if I say anything. With this threatening you have forced me.. And my daughter to dance to your tunes. I sheltered you. Saved you from the police. And today you are just alive because of me. No, sir. I am alive only for my daughter's sake. My poverty and daughter had forced me to commit crimes. And because of that I have even ran away from jail. But today when her life is in danger.. - Then I can even risk my life. - You don't know. - Give me this pistol. - What? - Hurry. Give. Father! Throw him. - Rakesh. - He was a very cunning and dangerous man. Inspector, why did he want to kill me? Because of your wealth. Which according to your father's veil.. Would go to the professor's daughter if you die. But how is Rakesh connected with that? Rakesh was connected to your daughter. Inspector! Even your daughter was with Rakesh in the plot to kill Suraj This is impossible, inspector. Ask her. Rita. Rita. Rita, what is all this? What is the inspector saying? What is he saying? You and Rakesh.. How is that possible? This is wrong. Say that it is false. It is impossible. Say that you can never do this. I am saying, tell these.. This is true. Speak, why don't you speak? Answer me. Ask me the answer. The day you found that skeleton and that statue.. That very day Rakesh hatched a plan to kill Suraj. And that very day the Kiranmai.. And her 2,000 years old story was born. Rakesh forced this innocent girl to be Kiranmai. Your daughter arranged for the ancient dresses and jewellery. Your daughter even fired false bullets in front of you on Kiranmai. And made you believe that she is a spirit. But why? Because they would have never got.. Suraj's wealth without your permission. I suspected Rakesh the very moment.. When he took Suraj and Kiran's photos and Kiran was not visible. Do you recognise him? Yes. He had lied that no horse cart had left the tunnel and you returned. If you had gone a little further you would have found.. The horse cart waiting among rocks. And this is the man whom you have met in the mansion. And this is the doctor who had injected Suraj. All these are Rakesh's men. All are criminals. Take them away. Professor. Professor, I am very sorry for your daughter. Inspector, the criminal should be punished. Kiran. What is this? A drama is over. My work is over. I had seen a beautiful dream that is over too. That is not over. It will become true now. No, Suraj. I am not worthy of your love. Kiran! "My love is such that even after I die.. I won't allow you to get out from my arms." "Even if I get heaven." "I will ask God you instead of heaven." "My love is such.."
